  "AbrahamRonen_10625": "(chuckle) Welcome to year five of Charms. Now, this will be a crucial year in your education on the art of Charmwork, but I am confident that we will take hold with the passion and rigour requisite of such a challenge.",
  "AbrahamRonen_10626": "Right, now everyone, please open your textbooks to page five one seven.",
  "AbrahamRonen_10628": "Ah, ah, ah, ah, I am afraid it is too late to study now.",
  "AbrahamRonen_10629": "Hmm – my, the summer months must have really taken a toll on you all. (chuckles) By the looks of it, you all spent your holidays practising Obliviate on one another. (laughs to self)",
  "AbrahamRonen_10630": "Hmm – well, it seems that we are in dire need of review. Everyone, get into pairs and take positions on opposite sides of the classroom.",
  "AbrahamRonen_10631": "The key to a successful Summoning Charm is to concentrate on the object that you desire to summon. Hold it clearly in your mind's eye.",
  "AbrahamRonen_10638": "I've always found that fun goes hand in hand with mastery, as I'm sure the Quidditch players amongst us would agree.",
  "AbrahamRonen_10640": "Very good!",
  "AbrahamRonen_10641": "Not to worry!",
  "AbrahamRonen_10648": "But there's certainly no sport in playing without some friendly competition.",
  "AbrahamRonen_10656": "– Anyone? Anyone? Hmm?",
  "AbrahamRonen_10657": "Now let’s put those textbooks to use as the blunt objects you so believe they are and take turns summoning them out of one another's hands.",
  "AbrahamRonen_10660": "Excellent control there.",
  "AbrahamRonen_10661": "Splendid!",
  "AbrahamRonen_10662": "That's it!",
  "AbrahamRonen_10663": "Stay focused.",
  "AbrahamRonen_10664": "Don't lose your composure!",
  "AbrahamRonen_10665": "Happens to the best of us.",
  "AbrahamRonen_10666": "Now, think of this like – Gobstones, if you will. But instead of throwing the marbles out, you are summoning them toward you.",
  "AbrahamRonen_10668": "Miss Onai, would you care to give our new student a bit of a challenge?",
  "AbrahamRonen_10669": "You are a swift learner! I see a lot of potential – but remember, potential is nothing without practice. Keep at it, you might just rival Miss Onai here!",
  "AbrahamRonen_10670": "Very simply, cast <i>Accio</i> on one of the spheres, and relinquish your charm at the last possible moment.",
  "AbrahamRonen_10672": "So, what better than a bit of sport to put our prowess with the Summoning Charm to the test? Right? (chuckle)",
  "AbrahamRonen_10674": "Only one book will be needed per partnership, Miss Dale. Thank you. Get into place now.",
  "AbrahamRonen_10675": "Do you even remember how to perform a basic Summoning Charm? Hmm?",
  "AbrahamRonen_10676": "But, before we begin, can anyone here tell me the difference between the incantations of the Colour Change and Growth Charms?",
  "AbrahamRonen_10677": "Very good everyone, that’s enough of that.",
  "AbrahamRonen_10678": "So, why don't we have our newest student start us off? Huh?",
  "AbrahamRonen_10679": "Let us make this a bit more interesting, shall we?",
  "AbrahamRonen_10680": "Come on up.",
  "AbrahamRonen_10682": "Ahem. Shall we begin?",
  "AbrahamRonen_10683": "Well, as you all seem to have the basics down, and it is an exceptionally lovely day, I was thinking that we might have ourselves a little excursion – outside for a spot of fresh air. After me.",
  "AbrahamRonen_10689": "Very good, both of you! Well done.",
  "AbrahamRonen_10691": "The trick is to pull the sphere as far as possible, but not a bit more, or it'll fall, yes?",
  "AbrahamRonen_10692": "Now, I could keep talking about theory all day, but practice is the best professor. Show us how it's done!",
  "AbrahamRonen_10707": "You'll be the blues, just as before, and Miss Onai, you are playing red. Clear?",
  "AbrahamRonen_10708": "The goblins have somehow evaded the castle's defensive charms.",
  "AbrahamRonen_10731": "Enough chatter – focus now, you will need it!",
  "AbrahamRonen_10821": "Excuse me, there seems to be a sleepwalking student on the loose.",
  "AbrahamRonen_10829": "I notice you and Professor Fig seem to have developed a friendship. Hope he isn't getting you into too much trouble.",
  "AbrahamRonen_10830": "Fig was a close colleague, and a dear friend. I only hope we can serve his memory well.",
  "AbrahamRonen_10833": "Hogwarts has stood for nearly 900 years. We were not about to give it up to a few mutinous goblins.",
  "AbrahamRonen_10936": "Very good – points to Gryffindor.",
  "AbrahamRonen_10938": "What charm is there in the expected?",
  "AbrahamRonen_10996": "You did well, managing to best as gifted a student as Miss Onai.",
  "AbrahamRonen_10997": "And what a close match between you and Miss Onai. Invigorating.",
  "AbrahamRonen_10998": "Miss Onai is a talented witch. Take it in stride – one often gains the most from the battles one has lost.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11011": "Marvellous. You clearly know your way around basic charms.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11013": "They are meant to give you first-hand experience as you proceed to master new bits of magic.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11014": "That's it – very good.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11015": "If you would like to practise mending something, have a go with that broken statue in the alcove by the water.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11016": "Nicely done. Works like a charm, doesn't it? ",
  "AbrahamRonen_11017": "Ah, there you are.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11019": "As Professor Weasley mentioned, I am not the only one who will be teaching you spells outside of class in an effort to catch you up with your peers.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11025": "<i>Reparo!</i>",
  "AbrahamRonen_11026": "Miss Onai has taken the lead!",
  "AbrahamRonen_11027": "And, with that, our newest student has taken the lead!",
  "AbrahamRonen_11037": "Indeed I am. Professors are allowed to have fun once in a while too, you know.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11038": "No time like the present.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11039": "Ah, very well.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11040": "Well done! You've beaten me at my own game.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11041": "As the new Summoner's Court champion, you have earned a token of recognition.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11042": "Excellent.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11043": "Very well. When you're ready, come and find me here.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11044": "Care to go another round?",
  "AbrahamRonen_11047": "Expect to hear from me soon regarding a special assignment that I am preparing for you.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11049": "I did. I trust your first Charms lesson lived up to expectation?",
  "AbrahamRonen_11061": "A number of your professors have agreed to do so as well. But first, each shall ask that you complete a few preliminary tasks to hone your magic.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11062": "Indeed I do. And an exceedingly useful one at that – the Mending Charm, <i>Reparo</i>.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11066": "I have arranged some for today. See them through and then report back to me. We will have you casting <i>Reparo</i> in no time.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11068": "No lesson or lecture can compare to first-hand experience, and these tasks should provide you with just that.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11069": "This round settles it all.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11075": "Let us give the old Mending Charm a try, then, shall we?",
  "AbrahamRonen_11077": "Such experience is invaluable when mastering any new bit of magic.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11080": "A word, if you would?",
  "AbrahamRonen_11091": "(exhale)",
  "AbrahamRonen_11092": "(chuckle)",
  "AbrahamRonen_11093": "(joyful chirp)",
  "AbrahamRonen_11094": "(satisfied chirp)",
  "AbrahamRonen_11095": "(chuckle)",
  "AbrahamRonen_11096": "(friendly chirping)",
  "AbrahamRonen_11098": "More frequently than one would imagine.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11136": "Fixes things right up. Makes a broken object good as new in the blink of an eye.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11137": "Remember to be deliberate in your enunciation and movements – I want to see some vigour. Now, wand at the ready.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11145": "That's no way to treat a professor.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11146": "And there you have it. Yet another opportunity to learn and improve!",
  "AbrahamRonen_11147": "Well now. Nicely played.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11148": "We all make mistakes!",
  "AbrahamRonen_11149": "Nicely done!",
  "AbrahamRonen_11150": "Come now. I know you can do this. You showed great promise in class.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11151": "Delightful to see such mastery from one your age.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11152": "Ordinarily, I might consider a tie inconclusive. Today, however, it has allowed me to conclude that you are quite a talented spellcaster.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11153": "<i>Accio!</i>",
  "AbrahamRonen_11154": "I knew you'd come around.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11155": "You possess great determination – a trait that will take you far in life.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11157": "Shall we begin?",
  "AbrahamRonen_11162": "Excellent work. Practice is the key to mastering any spell.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11164": "Class is dismissed. Gather your things on the way out.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11167": "I trust the preliminary tasks weren't too much trouble?",
  "AbrahamRonen_11180": "Ahem. Now, Professor Weasley has asked that your professors give you instruction outside of the ordinary curriculum.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11181": "Well played in Summoner's Court! I daresay I learned a bit from you. Always a treat.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11185": "I do not recall teaching you how to play like that.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11186": "Remember, your wand is a conduit of your magic.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11187": "Something quite satisfying about using the Mending Charm, isn't there?",
  "AbrahamRonen_11194": "Good luck!",
  "AbrahamRonen_11219": "I've been playing this for aeons, so you haven't a chance of winning. How about we get started anyway?",
  "AbrahamRonen_11220": "Not to worry. You are still finding your stride.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11221": "And I you.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11222": "I can manage to do both – work and play. And, who's to say I am not helping a student at this very moment?",
  "AbrahamRonen_11223": "Ah. One always has something to learn. You see? I just taught you something.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11224": "A flatterer, I see. Although, I daresay it's not unwarranted. I shall accept the compliment humbly.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11226": "Do not let it go to your head.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11227": "Not to worry. I haven't been beaten by a student yet.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11240": "A perfect score! Remarkable.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11244": "Very good – points to Hufflepuff.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11245": "Very good – points to Ravenclaw.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11246": "Very good – points to Slytherin.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11247": "It allegedly symbolised heartbreak. Perhaps a jilted lover thought it too accurate and lashed out.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11248": "Two perfect rounds? You're a natural!",
  "AbrahamRonen_11249": "Miss Onai is always a fierce competitor. Though I sense that she is a bit distracted of late.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11252": "Good luck, and I shall see you soon.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11253": "Well, it's been, what now? Seven swift years?",
  "AbrahamRonen_11254": "Time does fly because we have fun. Essential, in my opinion.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11256": "An eager, positive and confident mind is the most open to knowledge, I find.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11258": "Ah, well, each of us has our own 'style', I suppose.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11260": "Some in the teaching field believe that hard work and dedication are the only keys to success. But they forget what drives those things.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11261": "If one cannot fathom why some would expend energy on Gobstones, then one is blind to the enormous power of play.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11262": "Precisely. I strive to be the sort of professor that I would have enjoyed in school. My experience was – less cheerful.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11263": "Had I received a more traditional education, well – ",
  "AbrahamRonen_11264": "Enough about my student days. You are here now, and it would be a shame if you didn't enjoy it.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11265": "You are most welcome. Try to have a bit of fun today, eh?",
  "AbrahamRonen_11266": "I had bet myself a Butterbeer you'd be back to ask about that. Seems I have earned myself a trip to the Three Broomsticks.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11277": "Then we shall have to disagree. But, I appreciate your honesty.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11278": "Now, I shall not keep you from your studies – nor time with your fellow students. Both of which are invaluable to your education.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11280": "I always have time for my students. How may I help you?",
  "AbrahamRonen_11281": "Of course! What is it?",
  "AbrahamRonen_11286": "My father insisted rather adamantly that fun had no place when it came to learning.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11287": "I struggled with his rather Socratic method of teaching. Made no progress with even the simplest spells until I made a game of it.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11289": "I realised then how much fun was to be had in learning, and I decided to become a professor so that I may pass that joy along.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11290": "As the process itself became a source of joy, I was able to better retain what I was being taught.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11291": "Delighted to hear.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11293": "Ah, of course!",
  "AbrahamRonen_11294": "Ah, of course!",
  "AbrahamRonen_11295": "I see we have forgotten our robes today. Distracted by our studies, no doubt!",
  "AbrahamRonen_11296": "I could do with a cup of tea and a conversation on magical theory with Professor Fig. Brilliant wizard.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11297": "Such a loss – to our school and to wizardkind. Professor Fig was a good friend and a gifted scholar.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11298": "Cannot imagine having been in Hogsmeade during the troll attack. Thank goodness so many skilled witches and wizards reacted so quickly.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11299": "Ranrok underestimated the lengths the Hogwarts faculty would go to to protect this castle.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11300": "Made it through that enormous Field Guide, did you? Bravo!",
  "AbrahamRonen_11301": "What a joy Miss Onai is to have in class. She and her mother have been wonderful additions to Hogwarts.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11302": "Miss Sweeting is to be commended for her devotion to the study of beasts. I am glad to see her engage with other students as well.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11303": "Mr Sallow is skilled indeed with a wand. I do worry that his focus is misplaced, however.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11304": "I so admire Mr Thakkar's commitment to his studies – but I do hope he finds time to enjoy himself.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11305": "I daresay Miss Reyes would do well to have a bit more fun. Talented young witch, but rather competitive in my mind.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11306": "Mr Clopton certainly seems to understand the value of play. Possibly a bit too much at times.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11307": "You did not learn that in my class. I hope you will reconsider the use of such magic.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11309": "Well done! I confess I was astonished to see you during the battle, but we owe you a great debt.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11310": "Whilst I am impressed by your wandwork, I would suggest you set your aim a bit further from your professor.",
  "AbrahamRonen_11311": "Distracted thinking of your studies no doubt.",
  "AckleyBarnes_10060": "I'll fix him, that Charmgrinder.",
  "AckleyBarnes_10062": "He'll see it was a mistake – parting ways with me.",
  "AckleyBarnes_10064": "How kind of you to ask. The name's Ackley Barnes. And, no, it is not.",
  "AckleyBarnes_10065": "I'll show him volatile.",
  "AckleyBarnes_10067": "Supercilious fool. He's passionate about things too. As I intend to remind him – by relieving him of his prized possession –",
  "AckleyBarnes_10069": "Take as many Herbology supplies as you like while you're in his cellar. All I ask is that you bring me the Venomous Tentacula.",
  "AckleyBarnes_10070": "Excellent. I shall be right here. All I ask is that you bring me the Venomous Tentacula.",
  "AckleyBarnes_10071": "Marvellous. I know a fellow seeker of justice when I see one.",
  "AckleyBarnes_10072": "Well done. I'll take it off your hands now.",
  "AckleyBarnes_10073": "Here's a little something for your next trip to Zonko's.",
  "AckleyBarnes_10076": "I shall make an ocean of Galleons! And Lawley's business will be sunk.",
  "AckleyBarnes_10077": "Only fair, I suppose. I can respect your business acumen.",
  "AckleyBarnes_10079": "Oh, to see the look on Lawley's face the next time he wanders down to his cellar.",
  "AckleyBarnes_10082": "Remember, I just need that Venomous Tentacula.",
  "AckleyBarnes_10086": "Yes. Yes it was. Terribly. I'm simply passionate about my work.",
  "AckleyBarnes_10087": "I'm plotting a sort of revenge against my ex-business partner, a conniving fiend by the name of Alfred Lawley.",
  "AckleyBarnes_10093": "I had an idea to train Venomous Tentacula. Create 'guard plants', if you will, that attacked when ordered.",
  "AckleyBarnes_10094": "Simple: if I have it, then Lawley doesn't. Ergo, I can launch my business and he must start all over again.",
  "AckleyBarnes_10095": "All of Lawley's Herbology supplies. He has quite the collection.",
  "AckleyBarnes_10096": "But no one would suspect a student. How would you feel about committing some grand plant larceny?",
  "AckleyBarnes_10102": "Ha! Wish I could see Lawley's face when he realises his prized possession is gone. We'll see who's volatile now.",
  "AckleyBarnes_10103": "I can't get anywhere near it with Ruth Singer watching me like an Augurey. Lawley's doing, no doubt.",
  "AckleyBarnes_10104": "Fill your pockets while you're there. Ought to slow him down for a bit, and I can get my business going minus any competition.",
  "AckleyBarnes_10106": "I'm killing two Snidgets with one stone.",
  "AckleyBarnes_10107": "He cut me out of our Herbology supply business, just as we were getting started. Said I was too volatile to work with.",
  "AckleyBarnes_10108": "Of course I'm angry now. In large part due to his absurd overreaction to what is simply passion for my work.",
  "AckleyBarnes_10109": "– a Venomous Tentacula he's grown from a seedling that was to be the keystone of our business venture.",
  "AckleyBarnes_10110": "We hit a snag when one ate Lawley's Kneazle. After that he cut me out of the business, the shortsighted fiend.",
  "AckleyBarnes_10120": "Bring it to me. That'll show my ex-business partner not to mess with me.",
  "AckleyBarnes_10122": "Completed that errand for me yet?",
  "AckleyBarnes_10123": "Any luck retrieving a certain friend of mine from a former friend of mine?",
  "AckleyBarnes_10124": "Thank you again for your help. I suspect you have a bright future.",
  "AckleyBarnes_10125": "Oh, it's nothing. And he deserves it. Trust me. You'll be in and out of there in no time.",

  "AdelaideOakes_10001": "Uncle Rowland would never leave me to worry like this.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10052": "We are. My mother died when I was born. And I lost my father when I was five. Uncle Rowland's looked after me for as long as I can remember.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10483": "He knows I get anxious when he travels and that's why he sends me all the owls, to let me know that he's all right.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10490": "I, for one, can't help but look over my shoulder now whenever I leave the castle grounds.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10491": "It's clear you saved my uncle from a very bad lot.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10506": "Oh, Uncle Rowland, what have you got yourself into?",
  "AdelaideOakes_10508": "I am forever in your debt for what you've done.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10509": "We'd be lost without you.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10521": "Looking for me?",
  "AdelaideOakes_10522": "Hello.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10523": "Hello. I'm Adelaide. Adelaide Oakes. I don't think I've formally introduced myself yet.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10524": "It must be difficult beginning at a new school in your fifth year. I don't envy you, missing time at Hogwarts.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10526": "My uncle Rowland wanted to keep me home this year, but I honestly don't think I could have borne it.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10527": "T – till next time.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10529": "The more I learn about Ranrok's foul lot, the more astounded I am that my uncle survived.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10534": "So am I. Seeing him again was such a relief. I told him that he must remain vigilant from now on.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10536": "Very well, thanks to you.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10537": "He does it for me. Between robes and supplies – attending Hogwarts costs a fair Sickle. And besides that, Uncle Rowland has expensive taste.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10538": "He's sacrificed so much for me over the years. I promised him that as soon as I finish Hogwarts, I shall be the one taking care of him.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10540": "I do wonder about Professor Fig. He's hardly ever in his classroom. Most strange.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10541": "You duelled Sebastian! He's strong competition. Well done.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10542": "Yes. For ages. Even speaks Gobbledegook. But he only recently mentioned – (sigh) Ranrok's lot (sigh) – insisting the Galleons were worth the risk.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10543": "I'd love to have pet beasts at home, but with my uncle travelling all the time, there'd be no one to look after them.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10544": "Oh! Oh, no, he really isn't! He's a wonderful man actually. He just worries about me.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10545": "Oh, he's just being silly uncle Rowland. He worries about me.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10546": "You see, he works with goblins. Trading metals and the like.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10547": "And apparently there's a radical new leader in their midst who's making threats against wizards.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10548": "I haven't received an owl from him in ages. Perhaps I should send him an owl of my own to see if he's all right.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10549": "Oh, you too, you too. Thank you.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10552": "Oh, uncle – this doesn't sound like you. Something’s wrong.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10553": "Oh, hello there.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10554": "You're the new Hufflepuff, yes? I'm Adelaide. Pleasure to meet you.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10560": "And your reading is – the Dragon. That’s – exciting, I suppose. Perhaps you're due for an adventure.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10561": "Professor Shah.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10562": "Hm – oh, dear.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10563": "Tsk. Hm.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10564": "(muttering)",
  "AdelaideOakes_10565": "What's this? – hm.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10568": "Thank you. He's very thorough in his record keeping. Notes all his trades in a journal. Makes maps.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10569": "I – could you try to find out for me? From what I hear, you're almost as adventurous as Uncle Rowland.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10573": "Yes, I'm Adelaide Oakes. Oh, dear –",
  "AdelaideOakes_10574": "You see, my uncle Rowland is a metal trader who's quite well-known in the goblin community.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10579": "I do hope you're able to find out where he is. Thank you, again, for any help you can provide.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10582": "She's convinced he can handle himself. But I can't concentrate on anything until I know he's all right.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10583": "In his last owl, he alluded to dealings with those radical goblins – Ranrok's Loyalists. It's been ages since that owl and I'm worried.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10584": "Plenty. Uncle Rowland couldn't be certain, but he thought he overheard goblins talking about 'infusing' something into goblin silver.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10589": "What with the troll attack on Hogsmeade, and the rumours that goblins may have been involved, well, I'm fearing the worst.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10590": "You are much more understanding than Professor Weasley. She heard I was going to look for him and forbade me from leaving the grounds.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10593": "Oh, yes. I'm just a bit distracted. Letter from my uncle.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10594": "So, tell me – I've been hearing all sorts of rumours – were you really nearly gobbled up by a dragon?",
  "AdelaideOakes_10595": "Oh, dear – it must've been bad. I mean, of course it was, I know I would have been terrified.  Sorry.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10596": "That's – dreadful. Well, I'm glad you made it here alive.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10597": "Well, anyway. I imagine you have lots to do – I hope you have a wonderful first day.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10599": "Of course – and good luck.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10600": "Oh, yes. He travels for work, always busy. I'm sure he just wrote it in a rush.  Nothing to worry about.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10604": "Not sure what you can learn from these 'Astronomy Tables' that you can't learn from a cup of tea leaves.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10605": "I've not heard from my Uncle Rowland in quite some time. I've been beside myself with worry. Could you meet me in the courtyard?",
  "AdelaideOakes_10606": "I'm afraid not. I sent you that owl the moment Beasts class ended.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10607": "Thank you for coming.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10608": "He normally sends me owls every week when he's on his business travels.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10609": "Should I be worried about my uncle, or am I overthinking this?",
  "AdelaideOakes_10610": "That's exactly what Professor Weasley said when she forbade me from leaving the grounds to look for him.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10611": "In fact, in his last owl he drew me a map of his next stop. He'd planned to set up camp north of here.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10612": "Still nothing, I'm afraid. I'd be grateful for any help you could provide.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10613": "Nice to see you. Haven't seen you around the common room lately.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10614": "Oh, hello!",
  "AdelaideOakes_10615": "I looked back over his old owls and noticed that they included pertinent details about his rare metal deposits.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10616": "I believe that Ranrok's fiends were after those deposits, and that they needed my uncle's knowledge.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10617": "He was willingly going to rot away in that cell to keep me safe.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10618": "He wasn't sure what they meant, but something about the way they spoke of it made his skin crawl.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10619": "As I mentioned, he'd planned to set up camp north of here.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10620": "Uncle Rowland sends his best. He often asks after you in his owls.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10621": "Must be nice to not have anything to fret about.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10622": "I would swear my eyes are lying to me.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10623": "Some people simply can't be satisfied with a broom.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10624": "Oh. Er – that's fine. You're in your night clothes. I'll be on my way.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10625": "I hope wherever Fig is now, that he's at least with his wife.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10626": "The thing is, my poor uncle could run upon these trolls when he's on his travels.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10627": "I shall be worrying about my uncle now. What if there are some of Ranrok's Loyalists left?",
  "AdelaideOakes_10628": "Oh no, you shouldn't be using those spells, I'm sure of it.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10629": "I bet my uncle wouldn't mind learning how to do that.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10631": "Oh goodness, you need to practise a bit more I think.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10632": "Who would have thought someone as young as me could save my uncle's life.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10633": "Oh! Perhaps I wasn't looking where I was going.",
  "AdelaideOakes_10634": "Oh goodness,  perhaps I'll pretend I didn't see that.",

  "AdultFemaleA_10443": "Why is it that whenever I hear from Hogwarts, it's to tell me my child has broken school rules again!",
  "AdultFemaleA_10444": "Late on your homework! Not once, not even twice, but thrice now! Thrice!",
  "AdultFemaleA_10445": "Another detention! Another! And at your age. I thought you'd grown out of it, but I suppose that was wishful thinking. It's your father's fault.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10446": "(raspberry)",
  "AdultFemaleA_10466": "Well, like a Muggle! Learn to behave yourself, or it will be worse than Howlers for you.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10467": "I'd like to learn that you're receiving good grades, but no. What did I ever do to deserve this, hm?",
  "AdultFemaleA_10468": "You are ungrateful, ungraceful, and, frankly, unacademic. I am ashamed.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10469": "Do you intend to study, or do you plan to remain a nuisance forever? Get yourself to a library and get your head down!",
  "AdultFemaleA_10470": "Believe me, we are going to have a serious talk when you get home, and you will not enjoy it.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10471": "(laughter)",
  "AdultFemaleA_10472": "They are stunning, are they not?",
  "AdultFemaleA_10473": "I love how the wind catches them.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10475": "First knife to hit the fancy man gets a drink from me!",
  "AdultFemaleA_10476": "I can't believe Ferdinand's back. I thought he was gone for good.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10494": "Where could the Headmaster be off to in such a hurry?",
  "AdultFemaleA_10568": "Ho, did you see that?",
  "AdultFemaleA_10569": "You've tamed a Graphorn? I didn't know that was possible.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10570": "You must be very talented to earn the respect of a Hippogriff.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10575": "My goodness. Someone forgot their morning ritual.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10576": "I should not have had to see you in your inappropriate attire.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10580": "I heard that you lost your professor to a terrible accident. My deepest condolences.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10581": "Losing someone is always difficult. I'm truly sorry about Professor Fig.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10583": "I'm glad the teachers were able to defend Hogwarts. I shudder to think what would have happened if they'd failed.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10584": "I never trusted goblins, and I was right to do so.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10585": "Why would the goblins attack children?",
  "AdultFemaleA_10603": "What's all this about Rookwood and a treasure? Leave that rubbish for the cities. It has no place here.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10620": "Some people think the family fled, but I think they died in that house. Has anyone ever – searched for bodies in there?",
  "AdultFemaleA_10621": "The rumours were true. The family did die in the house. Driven mad, of course, and not cursed, but still.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10625": "Those spiders made an awful mess of the place.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10627": "After all that mess with the spiders, why would Milo seek out another one?",
  "AdultFemaleA_10628": "That Rampant Dugbog is getting bolder every day. Or hungrier.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10629": "I wonder what adventures Bardolph Beaumont's getting into?",
  "AdultFemaleA_10630": "Who needs the bustle of a city?",
  "AdultFemaleA_10632": "That Belgruff the Bludgeoner's been spotted nearby. Our little hamlet is doomed.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10633": "Yes, word has it he's gone. Belgruff the Bludgeoner finally got what he deserved and is no more.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10634": "Feldcroft survived this time, but how long will our luck hold out? I fear the goblins are growing stronger.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10635": "Such a shame to have lost him. He was so young.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10637": "I used to feel safe here in Irondale. But, now with that strange Dugbog about, I feel nervous all the time.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10638": "Thank goodness they captured that strange Dugbog. I felt nervous all the time.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10639": "I used to feel safe here in Irondale. But, now with that Selwyn character about, I'm always looking over my shoulder.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10640": "Clementine Willardsey is always lurking about the edge of the Forbidden Forest. Why won't she go in?",
  "AdultFemaleA_10642": "I feel safer now that Ranrok's Loyalists are gone.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10643": "No doubt Ranrok's Loyalists intended to rob me, but I got away just in time. I could hear them laughing as I fled.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10644": "Claire Beaumont was thick as thieves with her brother. No wonder she's distraught he's vanished.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10645": "That troll is nothing but trouble. I rarely leave Keenbridge anymore, knowing he's out there somewhere.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10646": "Now that troll has been dealt with, Keenbridge is finally safe again.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10649": "I'm not sure I can believe most of the stories Helen tells, but I suppose that's what comes of a life in the Ministry.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10650": "Helen was attacked in Azkaban. Horrible place.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10651": "Who am I to question the wisdom of a troll? If it wants to get hit by a train, let it.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10652": "I don't know how our local troll got itself killed, but I reckon it was a train that did it.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10669": "Honeydukes can't hold a candle to my treacle fudge.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10670": "Everyone's always wanting my potion recipes. I should write a book.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10671": "Anyone casting Unforgivable Curses should be tossed into Azkaban and I dare anyone to argue it.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10672": "Those that say <i>Avada Kedavra</i> could be used for good belong in Azkaban.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10673": "Oh, that's what the authorities are for,' they say. Hmph. Try finding one.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10674": "Morgan Le Fay got an unearned reputation, if you ask me.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10675": "Muggles have made life hard for us since the dawn of time.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10676": "I miss the old Quidditch goalposts.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10677": "I'd rather scrape cauldrons than work with Muggles.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10678": "Oh, I'm working. Working on not working.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10679": "Never trust a man who looks too smart. That's what my mother always said.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10680": "The Minister for Magic didn't get where he is by sitting on his hands.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10681": "Not a day goes by I don't use something I didn't learn at Hogwarts.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10682": "<i>Wingardium Leviosa</i> makes light work, I always say.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10683": "<i>Expelliarmus</i> can disarm a Dark wizard no doubt. But then what? Fleeing?",
  "AdultFemaleA_10697": "That Catrin Haggarty has the lightest fingers you've never seen.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10698": "I feel much richer now that Catrin Haggarty's gone.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10699": "Pergit thinks he's untouchable, hiding down in Korrow Ruins.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10700": "Such a relief to have Pergit gone.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10701": "I saw footprints in the mud the other day – troll footprints.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10702": "I haven't seen any troll footprints in a while. Do you suppose the troll wandered off?",
  "AdultFemaleA_10703": "Found just the book on poltergeists I was looking for the other day at Tomes and Scrolls. No idea where that man finds his inventory but it's marvellous.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10704": "The only thing Hogsmeade's lacking is its own Quidditch team.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10705": "Wonder how I'd get on working as a referee for professional Quidditch matches. It's in my blood, you know. My mother's family comes from just outside Queerditch.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10706": "Myself, I've never been comfortable being waited on by anyone – let alone an elf with no choice in the matter.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10707": "We're witches and wizards. We can conjure almost anything we need whilst barely lifting a finger.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10708": "I think we can all agree that what Muggles lack in magical ability, they make up for in tea. Earl Grey, specifically.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10709": "For all we talk about them, I honestly can't remember the last time I spoke to a Muggle.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10710": "My children – and my husband for that matter – know not to press me too much. I'm not above using a Blasting Curse in the house when necessary.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10711": "My children do love her, but what I wouldn't give for a spell to keep my mother in-law from visiting every week. Ugh, and the sweets she brings! It's a wonder they've a tooth left in their heads.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10712": "Don't think I've ever seen a child take to a creature like my daughter to her snowy owl. I never get a single letter when she's away at school because she refuses to part with him.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10713": "I've  always thought that if the four founders had got on better, Hogwarts wouldn't have fostered such intense house rivalries. Still, does make for an exciting Quidditch season – when there is one.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10714": "I did see Professor Weasley in the village recently. She was stopping by Tomes and Scrolls. I'd imagine she was organising spellcrafts for some of the new students.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10715": "Tried to have a chat with Ellie Peck the other day. Needed some Mooncalf fur. Very nice young lady, but could I get her to stop talking about Fwoopers and Diricawls?",
  "AdultFemaleA_10716": "Did you know that Albie Weekes has been designing his own brooms? Such an entrepreneur, that young man.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10717": "I sometimes stop into Madam Snelling's just to see how Calliope has done her hair that day. She's brilliantly creative, although possibly somewhat impractical.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10718": "Spotted that Graphorn, the Lord of the Shore, wandering the cliffs the other day. Got out of there quick as I could.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10719": "Is it true that someone was seen riding the Lord of the Shore?",
  "AdultFemaleA_10720": "Milo's murderer has been slain. That's some comfort for his little girl.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10721": "Left behind a darling little girl, too. Poor thing.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10722": "Are those the cabbages, Bernard?",
  "AdultFemaleA_10723": "Miss Moffett only cares about using their feathers for what she calls 'fashion'.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10724": "I can't leave my house anymore what with Alexandra's troll lurking about.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10725": "It's grunting all the time. As though it's trying to talk to me. Completely unnerving.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10727": "Dreadful what happened to Mr Bickle. His poor widow and son. He was a good man, he was.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10728": "Thank goodness Marianne Moffett didn't get her hands on that beautiful bird. Her fashion sense is atrocious.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10729": "I'm not sure if I believe it. Centaurs? Here?",
  "AdultFemaleA_10730": "Upper Hogsfield fancies itself highbrow, but we know that's not the case.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10731": "Hard to believe the thief was only a Niffler. And there we were blaming Catrin Haggarty!",
  "AdultFemaleA_10732": "So, the notorious, Irondale jewellery thief was a Niffler?",
  "AdultFemaleA_10733": " The youth these days.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10734": "Quite the flyer.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10735": "How incredible!",
  "AdultFemaleA_10736": "Best hold tight!",
  "AdultFemaleA_10737": "Wearing the latest from Paris, are we?",
  "AdultFemaleA_10738": "I wonder what could have provoked trolls to attack Hogsmeade?",
  "AdultFemaleA_10739": "No surprise that Ranrok met his end against such powerful witches and wizards.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10740": "It's such a relief that the goblins are gone.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10741": "Harlow got what was coming to him.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10742": "Whoever defeated Silvanus Selwyn must have been quite powerful.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10743": "When I tried following butterflies, I found a wretched snake, not a treasure.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10744": "What on earth did Alexandra expect? Look at what happened to Hogsmeade with trolls. As if she could be friends with one?",
  "AdultFemaleA_10745": "Who robs a house for its plants? Strange business.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10746": "Well if it isn't the famous Troll Slayer!",
  "AdultFemaleA_10747": "So pleased to hear that Johanna's son has returned.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10748": "Agnes Coffey's Niffler is bound to escape again.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10749": "Has someone tampered with the statue? It looks – different.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10750": "I hear Feldcroft is once again free of goblins.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10751": "I've heard we have a student to thank for the disappearance of so many under Rookwood's command.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10752": "Can you imagine? Turns out it was a student's doing, stopping that troll attack in Hogsmeade.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10753": "I hear Ferdinand's portrait's back at the Three Broomsticks.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10754": "Quite the beast you've obtained.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10755": "We'll see how long Ferdinand lasts at the Hog's Head.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10756": "Just what the Hog's Head needs; more babbling portraits.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10757": "That will earn you a trip to Azkaban.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10758": "Ahem. I'm sure that's locked for a reason.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10760": "Someone seems to have ruffled the feathers of those Ashwinders.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10761": "Sounds as if Ranrok's Loyalists have met their match.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10762": "Careful, or someone'll get hurt. And it had better not be me.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10763": "Seems the Poachers have become the prey.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10764": "I do believe it's the Troll Whisperer.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10765": "I can finally rest easy at night, now that horrid spider business is dealt with.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10766": "Excuse me!",
  "AdultFemaleA_10767": "Last time a tidal surge hit us, we had waves as tall as Hungarian Horntails – d'you remember?",
  "AdultFemaleA_10768": "Well I saw a shape like a lightning strike in my tea leaves last night. Foul weather's coming, sure as anything.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10769": "I wonder if that travelling salesman's still about. We could use some fresh stocks.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10770": "I heard that Agnes Coffey has a new dress in stock – a style straight from the salons in Paris.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10771": "The seagulls are such scavengers. I had a locket stolen right out of my hand, I did!",
  "AdultFemaleA_10772": "There's something about the beautiful symmetry of shells that enchants me.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10773": "Awful influx of wizards from the South around lately. Oh, they do walk quick.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10774": "There's no denying the conveniences of city living, but can you imagine not having access to fresh toad hide or Fwooper eggs?",
  "AdultFemaleA_10775": "The way the boys cavort about on the beach, seems I'm casting <i>Episkey</i> on them ten times a day.",
  "AdultFemaleA_10776": "My mother used to take me to see the travelling performers when they came through the countryside. Such marvels!",
  "AdultFemaleA_10777": "You idiot! Lolly has served our family for five generations, and you go and give her clothes?",
  "AdultFemaleA_10778": "Now I will have to cook and clean until we can replace her with another elf! Did you think of that? Or do you hate your mother that much?",
  "AdultFemaleA_10779": "Run!",
  "AdultFemaleA_10780": "Troll!",

  "AdultFemaleB_10448": "Can you explain why I have received a letter from a Muggle, claiming to be the mother of a friend of yours, asking me to afternoon tea?",
  "AdultFemaleB_10450": "Acceptable? Acceptable? In Transfiguration? No child of mine should receive less than Outstanding! What are you even doing in that class?",
  "AdultFemaleB_10451": "You scoundrel! I do not pay for all your school things to be rewarded with a house full of hexes!",
  "AdultFemaleB_10452": "(raspberry)",
  "AdultFemaleB_10470": "What did I tell you about making friends with Muggle-borns? I am highly affronted! You will not associate with this 'friend' anymore.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10471": "And if I hear from this woman again, I will see to it myself that you don't.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10473": "Or is it that snivelling teacher of yours? You can be sure, I will be having words with that so-called school. You will receive an Outstanding, one way or another.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10474": "Your father's in St Mungo's to get his horns removed, and it's taken the house-elf a week to unstick that screaming portrait.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10475": "A week! You will behave, or so help me Merlin, I will bring you straight back home.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10476": "Dear me, can't you keep it down? Some of us are trying to rest.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10477": "What was his stupid, pompous name again? Ferdaline?",
  "AdultFemaleB_10478": "Why doesn't Sirona just throw him in the rubbish? He's a portrait, for Merlin's sake.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10496": "Does something about the Headmaster seem a bit odd?",
  "AdultFemaleB_10557": "What are you doing?",
  "AdultFemaleB_10569": "Wonder where they're off to in such a hurry.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10570": "Astonishing! I didn't know wizards could ride Graphorns.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10571": "I've never seen anyone ride a Hippogriff before. Too unruly. Usually.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10576": "Are those your pyjamas?",
  "AdultFemaleB_10577": "Look! They're wearing their nightclothes!",
  "AdultFemaleB_10581": "Poor Professor Fig – such a shame.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10582": "I was told that your professor died. My condolences.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10585": "Did goblins really attack Hogwarts? I can't believe it.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10586": "What are these goblins up to? Attacking Hogwarts.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10607": "That rumour about the treasure in the hills has been around since I was a girl – perhaps that's why Rookwood's henchmen are here.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10624": "I'm sure those Ashwinders are trying to get into the manor – pilfer what was left behind.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10625": "Now that the Inferius has been dealt with, I'd wager those thieves have already ransacked the place.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10629": "I shan't feel safe around spiders for the rest of my life.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10630": "If I don't bother the Absconder it won't bother me.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10632": "Forest life's the life for me.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10633": "Upper Hogsfield is the only Hogsfield as far as I'm concerned.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10634": "Likely that Dugbog got what was coming. I haven't seen it for a while.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10636": "Merlin's beard. How am I to travel now that Belgruff has been spotted about these parts?",
  "AdultFemaleB_10637": "If somebody finally took care of the Bludgeoner, then I suppose I'll finally rest easy tonight.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10638": "Solomon Sallow fought most valiantly. Were it not for him, things would have been much worse for us all.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10639": "I haven't seen Sebastian since Solomon died. I wonder if he's even received word of it. So heartbreaking.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10641": "I don't like having horrid-looking beasts like Dugbogs about the place. Those teeth.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10642": "Even though someone caught that awful Dugbog, I still don't like them. Those teeth.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10643": "Oh I don't like having a goblin mine so close to Irondale, especially with rumours of a rebellion so rampant.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10644": "Clementine seems to be in her own world – but her world seems lovely.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10646": "What a relief – to be free of Ranrok's troublesome followers.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10647": "Ranrok's Loyalists have ruined all that was good about our hamlet.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10648": "Bardolph Beaumont had good reason to loathe the Loyalists, but resorting to Dark Magic? It's not right.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10649": "Last I heard, Bardolph was looking for Victor Rookwood. Now, he's disappeared.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10650": "'I hear the troll.' Those words have come to send chills down my spine. He's an awful terror, that one.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10651": "That old troll left plenty behind – all the stolen items he'd been hoarding. Might be worth a look.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10654": "It's not every day you meet a retired Auror. Helen's a credit to Upper Hogsfield.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10655": "I can't believe Helen's been attacked.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10656": "There's a troll living in a tunnel nearby. It's not likely to be there for long.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10657": "I suppose there's a lesson we can all learn from our dearly departed troll – don't mess about on train tracks.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10658": "I'm used to catching a few glances.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10659": "My appearance doesn't need the assistance of charms. I've a natural glow.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10660": "First they're teaching students jinxes, next thing you know it's Unforgivable Curses!",
  "AdultFemaleB_10661": "If it thinks it's got half a chance, a werewolf'd be on you like Bowtruckles to Doxy eggs.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10662": "Polyjuice Potion wants keeping away from today's young I'd say.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10663": "Hengist of Woodcroft certainly knew how to plan a city.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10664": "Those that go to Azkaban never had a chance in the first place.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10665": "Good thing the Ministry banned underage sorcery. Can't trust the young.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10666": "My first employment was at Honeydukes. (giggles) Stock girl I was. I did put on a bit of weight though.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10667": "If only I could invent a new potion – something indispensable; I'd be set for life. Not to worry. I like baking.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10668": "The work it takes to keep a clean house is staggering, even with magic.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10669": "Work hard and don't be afraid to fail. That is the path of a leader.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10670": "I can't imagine how Muggles get by without magic. Almost makes me feel a bit guilty.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10671": "If something threatens me, first thing I cast is <i>Protego</i>.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10672": "Only a hairy-hearted sod would cast <i>Flipendo</i> on a cow.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10676": "What's the point of having a purse when Catrin Haggarty's on the prowl? That woman steals everything.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10677": "No one I miss less than Catrin Haggarty.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10678": "I'm losing a lot of business thanks to that blasted goblin.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10679": "Trade's definitely improved without that horrible old goblin.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10680": "A troll in the train tunnel and another one somewhere in the woods? Brocburrow isn't what it used to be.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10681": "I'm almost positive the troll was in the cursed tomb. The curse must've caught up with it.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10682": "I daresay the most charming thing about Hogsmeade is its distinct lack of Muggles.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10683": "Never can decide where to go for a Butterbeer – the Hog's Head or the Three Broomsticks. Both have their charms to be sure. Course, it's always a treat to see Sirona, so the Three Broomsticks usually wins out.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10684": "My plan is to have enough Galleons one day that I don't have to work at all. I shall spend my days baking treacle tarts and degnoming the garden.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10685": "Those of us who were raised properly can pick up after ourselves. We don't need a house-elf to do it.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10686": "I wouldn't feel right asking an elf to pick up after me.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10687": "Simply horrible the things I've heard Muggles do to women they think are witches.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10688": "Did you know they call Muggles 'No-Majes' in America? Just saying it out loud tickles me.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10689": "Far back as I can recall, everyone in my family's been clumsy as an ox. And my sister's children are no exception. First thing I taught them was how to brew Wiggenweld Potion. Good thing too.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10690": "Listening to you lot go on about your children makes me grateful for my loyal Crup.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10691": "I told my nieces I'd leave my grandmother's silver cauldron to whichever one of them looked after me in my old age. They've each taken to checking in on me weekly, which is very nice of course, but I'd say it's a bit too soon.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10692": "I so rarely see any of the Hogwarts professors about the village. Do you? Perhaps they need a reprieve from the students as much as the students do from them.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10693": "Thank goodness for Professor Weasley.  I don't know what the students would do without her. Voice of reason under the reign of that clueless headmaster. They're lucky to have her.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10694": "When I need to replenish my Herbology supplies, I go to Timothy Teasdale at the Magic Neep. Easier on my nerves than Dogweed and Deathcap. Less poison and fewer spikes.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10695": "Poor Mr Ollivander seems to spend more time cleaning up his shop from errant wand casts than actually selling the things.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10696": "Did I see Otto Dibble from Gladrags looking smitten with Rosie Hill the other day? Wonder if Augustus knows his worker's sweet on his daughter.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10697": "I'd think that Graphorn wandering the shore must be lonely. Never seen another.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10698": "I might've had too much Butterbeer, but I could've sworn I saw a Hogwarts student riding a Graphorn.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10699": "Will someone please do something about that Rampant Dugbog?",
  "AdultFemaleB_10700": "There used to be a Rampant Dugbog? I'd forgotten all about it.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10701": "Pity about Milo. One less spider in the world is always a good thing, I suppose.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10702": "Not surprised. Even a Niffler scares you.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10703": "Theophilus Harlow came by here – looking for Mr Bickle. Very concerning.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10704": "I heard someone say they saw a group of centaurs loitering in the forest. I can't help but wonder why.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10705": "Our Upper Hogsfield neighbours need to be taken down a peg.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10706": "Niffler, Haggarty, what's the difference? Both greedy thieves.",
  "AdultFemaleB_10707": "Agnes's Niffler, Rococo, once took all of my grandmother's jewellery. She found it weeks later in a neighbour's kitchen.",

  "AdultFemaleC_10437": "How could you? You have not only lied to me about your house, but you have made a fool of me in front of our friends and neighbours.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10438": "Hexing a teacher! A teacher! You're lucky they don't expel you.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10439": "Why, when I go to Gringotts, do I get some snivelling wizard telling me you've frittered away half our fortune on the sweets trolley?",
  "AdultFemaleC_10440": "And another, yes another Inflating Charm! How many times do I have to tell you not to use it on other people?",
  "AdultFemaleC_10441": "(raspberry)",
  "AdultFemaleC_10449": "Oh yes, it seems they knew! You will march to Professor Black's office this instant and demand to be re-Sorted. No child of mine is ever going to wear those colours. Ever!",
  "AdultFemaleC_10450": "If you don't get your act together, I shall fly straight to Hogwarts and snap your wand in half myself!",
  "AdultFemaleC_10451": "Are you trying to bankrupt us? 'Put it on my mother's account', you say! Well, no more. I am cutting you off!",
  "AdultFemaleC_10452": "You've let me down, and you've let yourself down, but nobody can let Mrs Dorraway down, and it's all your fault!",
  "AdultFemaleC_10458": "(laughter)",
  "AdultFemaleC_10459": "I always did enjoy kites.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10460": "Nothing better for a windy day, wouldn't you agree?",
  "AdultFemaleC_10462": "Look at his face – it's just asking for a splash of Ogden's.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10463": "With that portrait back, I might have to stop coming here.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10480": "Nice to see you, Headmaster.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10484": "All this nonsense about the Ashwinders, the Poacher Pack, and the treasure is just that – nonsense.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10501": "No one knows what happened to the family that lived there. If you ask me, that place is cursed.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10502": "Apparently the sounds coming from the manor were Inferi. The dead rising here in Bainburgh? Can't fathom it.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10507": "Here's to the ones we lost to those wretched, vile spiders.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10509": "I wish the Poacher Pack would find another hamlet to bother.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10510": "Don't mind visiting Lower Hogsfield. Nice to come home here though.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10599": "I hope they know what they're doing on that broom. This is how accidents happen.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10601": "Merlin's beard, I wouldn't stand for such reckless behaviour if that was my child.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10606": "Bold fashion choice.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10607": "Not one for appearances, are you.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10634": "What's that Rampant Dugbog have against our village anyway?",
  "AdultFemaleC_10636": "As though things weren't bad enough, now we must deal with that blasted goblin.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10637": "What a relief it'll be to travel freely again, without that treacherous goblin roaming our hills.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10638": "The goblins seem to have it in for us. Other hamlets aren't dealing with these regular attacks.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10639": "Anne and Sebastian are on their own now. How tragic to lose your uncle and guardian at such a young age.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10641": "I wish someone would catch that rogue Dugbog.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10642": "Ugh. Finally, someone did something about that rogue Dugbog.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10643": "Don't know why anyone from the Ashwinders wants to lurk about in Irondale. Not as if we're a wealthy lot.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10644": "I've better things to do than loiter about the Forbidden Forest. Clementine's welcome to spend all of her time doing so.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10646": "They were an evil lot. Good riddance.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10647": "I haven't travelled anywhere in weeks. Not with the stories I've heard about Ranrok's goblins in the area.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10648": "Keenbridge would be a far more pleasant place were it not for that troll. His presence afflicts us all.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10649": "Well, I'm relieved to know that troll won't be plaguing our lives anymore. He was always at the back of my mind.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10652": "Helen's told me a few secrets from her time as an Auror. I daren't share them.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10653": "I suppose a life of drama invites such drama. Poor Helen.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10654": "Well that troll's about to learn an important lesson when it comes to larking about on train tracks.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10655": "They say that troll in the tunnel's been done in, but I'm not brave enough to find out.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10656": "My Hogwarts uniform still fits. Good ancestry, that is.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10657": "I can transfigure anything if I put my mind to it.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10658": "Dark wizards are greedier than Nifflers and meaner than trolls.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10659": "You don't ever want to find yourself in the pocket of one who knows the Cruciatus Curse.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10660": "Not much of the Dark Arts that frightens me as long as I have my wand.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10661": "Will there ever be another wizard as peculiar as Uric the Oddball?",
  "AdultFemaleC_10662": "Has there ever been a vampire worth knowing?",
  "AdultFemaleC_10663": "Goblins have been running Gringotts since its bricks were laid.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10664": "I used to help out at the Three Broomsticks when I was younger.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10665": "I don't think anyone at the Ministry works a day in their life.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10666": "We could use a few more house-elves in my house.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10667": "A spot of failure's a good thing. Builds character.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10668": "You'd think knowing spells would simplify things. Never seems to work that way for me.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10669": "<i>Reparo</i> has saved me more broken glasses than I care to count.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10670": "I simply pretended that someone had used <i>Expelliarmus</i> but really I'd forgotten to bring it out with me.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10675": "I should set a Niffler on Catrin Haggarty to get my Galleons back.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10676": "I suppose I could get an account at Gringotts now that Catrin Haggarty's not here to steal my savings.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10677": "Business would be fine if it weren't for that horrible goblin.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10678": "It's good to see things getting back to normal with Pergit out of the way.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10679": "Something needs to be done about the troll in the woods – before someone gets hurt.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10680": "Well, whatever happened, I'm glad it did. Brocburrow's much safer now that that troll is gone.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10681": "Have you seen this season's hats at Gladrags? Delightful colours. I think I might have to get one of each.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10682": "There's nowhere like Zonko's for buying gifts. For others or oneself.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10683": "If I thought I could compete with Sirona, I'd open my own pub in Hogsmeade. On second thought, I'd rather be the one drinking the Firewhisky than pouring it.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10684": "I heard that the Black family – as in Phineas Nigellus Black – decapitates their house-elves. What a cruel family.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10685": "It's terribly upsetting to witness house-elves punish themselves.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10686": "Boggles the mind that hundreds of us have run at the wall at King's Cross to get to Platform 9 3/4, yet nary a Muggle seems to notice.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10687": "For all their faults, most Muggles I've met seem quite pleasant. Gets so tiring, wizardkind's constant battle with other beings. It's tempting to simply go and live amongst the Muggles for a change.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10688": "They learn eventually. For years my mother conjured anything my daughter wanted. Spoilt her rotten, she did. Had a bit of a rude awakening her first days at Hogwarts – no one catering to her every whim.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10689": "We had assumed that all the children would be Sorted into Hufflepuff. Imagine our surprise when the youngest was put into Ravenclaw. Still, she has always been quite the reader. And she's quite useful when you have a question.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10690": "My eldest son is sweet on a Muggle boy that lives near my sister. I've nothing against it, mind, but I told him to make sure he's loved for himself and not his magic.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10691": "I'd say the new Hogwarts caretaker certainly thinks highly of himself, doesn't he? Also seems to enjoy more than a dram of Firewhisky.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10692": "When I was a student at Hogwarts, my favourite class was  Astronomy. Kept having to explain to my mother that it wasn't the same as Astrology. She was very disappointed when I couldn't help her with her horoscope.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10693": "I'm forever at the Three Broomsticks, I am. I enjoy a nice beverage. Then I find myself still there hours later chatting away to Sirona. Lovely woman, she is.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10694": "Augustus Hill has such tact. Just the other day I heard him talking a woman out of a hat that would've most certainly brought out all of her worst features. You have to admire that in a shop owner.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10695": "I do wish Pippin would share some of his secret family recipes. I appreciate the ready-made potions, of course, but I do like to brew my own when I can.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10696": "I wonder if it's true that the Lord of the Shore's ancestors were in this area for centuries.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10697": "These rumours about someone riding a Graphorn are ridiculous. Impossible.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10698": "Now that it's gone, I rather miss that old Dugbog. It kept things interesting.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10700": "Students rid us of the Ashwinders. There's the Ministry, didn't do a thing!",
  "AdultFemaleC_10701": "Careful. Ranrok's Loyalists have set up camp ahead. Looked as if they were travelling with stolen goods.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10702": "Wish I could get away with that! (chuckles)",
  "AdultFemaleC_10703": "Can you do any tricks?",
  "AdultFemaleC_10704": "(gasp) How does one even tame a Graphorn?",
  "AdultFemaleC_10705": "I'd take a Hippogriff over a broom any day!",
  "AdultFemaleC_10706": "Perhaps those Hogsmeade trolls were only trying to do some shopping. (giggles)",
  "AdultFemaleC_10707": "Minister Spavin should resign after what became of those Loyalists and their 'rebellion'.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10708": "Best stop by Arn's cart later, now that he's back in business and all.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10709": "With Harlow gone, I feel I can finally breathe again. (exhale)",
  "AdultFemaleC_10710": "Silvanus Selwyn can rot in hell. Good riddance, I say.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10711": "That batty Clementine. (chuckles) Roping a poor Hogwarts student into her delusions.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10712": "The Troll Vanquisher! Our hero!",
  "AdultFemaleC_10713": "Alfred Lawley – robbed! Who's next?",
  "AdultFemaleC_10714": "Well if it isn't the Troll Slayer!",
  "AdultFemaleC_10715": "Poor Johanna Bickle must be mortified. Having a son needs rescuing by Hogwarts students.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10716": "All Agnes Coffey talks about is that blasted Niffler. Sometimes I wish it had stayed gone.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10717": "I swear to Merlin, that statue near Irondale looks different than before. Just can't put my wand on how.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10718": "Bless that Sallow boy and his friend. They saved poor Feldcroft from ruin.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10719": "Hogsmeade's saviour! We'll send an owl if any more of those trolls turn up. (chuckles)",
  "AdultFemaleC_10720": "Can't even have a pint at the Broomsticks without that blasted portrait breathing down my neck –",
  "AdultFemaleC_10721": "I trust you'll be able to care for that beast.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10722": "Might be about time to pester ol' Pratt in the Hog's head. (laughs)",
  "AdultFemaleC_10723": "I wonder what happened to that bothersome portrait in the Three Broomsticks? Not that I want him back. (laughs)",
  "AdultFemaleC_10724": "Do they teach you that at Hogwarts?",
  "AdultFemaleC_10727": "Suppose you don't know what locked means?",
  "AdultFemaleC_10729": "Ashwinders don't seem their usual brutish selves. Someone give them a good thrashing?",
  "AdultFemaleC_10730": "Fewer and fewer Loyalists around recently. Must be getting scared. (chuckles)",
  "AdultFemaleC_10731": "Dear me!",
  "AdultFemaleC_10732": "Swear I spied a student battling the Poacher Pack. And winning!",
  "AdultFemaleC_10733": "Troll Whisperer!",
  "AdultFemaleC_10734": "Let's hope that Acromantula is the last of Aranshire's spider troubles.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10735": "Too many Butterbeers?",
  "AdultFemaleC_10736": "Centaurs coming here? I wonder if it's an omen?",

  "AdultFemaleC_10738": "When my little girl gets scared of the storms, I just tell her a Thunderbird must be visiting.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10739": "The list of food requests for my household seems to have an 'Ever-Extending' Charm placed upon it.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10740": "I brought some lovely shells back to our house, but the garden gnomes ran off with them. Ruddy things.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10741": "If you come with me to the beach one day, I'll show you how to get a periwinkle out of its shell with a pin.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10742": "Just because they can go to Diagon Alley whenever they want doesn't make those city witches any better than us.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10743": "We've just acclimated to a slower, more peaceful way of life here in the countryside.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10744": "We do have to become adept at certain healing spells, don't we, what with all the danger that can be had out here.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10745": "Children can be a danger to themselves once they start discovering magic.",
  "AdultFemaleC_10746": "Does anyone else remember those levitating pies they used to sell at the bakery? I do miss those.",

  "AdultFemaleD_10437": "May I remind you that I did not raise you to break school rules and run around the castle after curfew!",
  "AdultFemaleD_10438": "What do you mean you won't be coming home for the holidays? Darling Aunt Philomena has come all the way from Guernsey!",
  "AdultFemaleD_10439": "(raspberry)",
  "AdultFemaleD_10444": "If I discover that you have been using Polyjuice Potion again, I shall write to the Headmaster and ask him to expel you. Mark my words!",
  "AdultFemaleD_10445": "An enchanted quill, indeed – and in your N.E.W.T.s! We are disgraced!",
  "AdultFemaleD_10446": "Have you any idea what sort of trouble you might get yourself into? You're lucky I don't come up there myself!",
  "AdultFemaleD_10447": "Well, the joke is on you because now you won't be getting any of her goose and gooseberry pie. Ha!",
  "AdultFemaleD_10453": "Can you hex a portrait? I get the first go!",

  "AdultFemaleD_10562": "Oh my! How dangerous.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10567": "You look ridiculous.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10568": "That's hardly an appropriate outfit.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10572": "I'm so very sorry about your professor.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10573": "My condolences for your loss.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10574": "Never trust a goblin, that's what my father used to say.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10575": "Perhaps it's time we hear what the goblins have to say?",
  "AdultFemaleD_10576": "I'm glad the children are safe.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10577": "I always thought Hogwarts was supposed to be the safest place in the world.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10596": "Phineas Nigellus Black himself. Coming this way.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10599": "I don't believe there ever was treasure in those hills. Baffling that anyone would actually waste time looking for it.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10616": "Pity about the place. It was so lovely a few years back. Now it's fallen to ruin.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10617": "Simply tragic. Lovely young family. Always had a smile for anyone they met.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10620": "You'll never be truly free in the city. That's why I prefer the forest.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10621": "Upper Hogsfield is a hidden gem, if you ask me.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10622": "Is that Dugbog rampaging through some other hamlet now? Certainly haven't seen him round here for a bit.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10624": "I've heard of Belgruff the Bludgeoner, and this is assuredly not good news.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10625": "We'd considered leaving here, but if that fiend's been dealt with then we'll gladly remain in Feldcroft.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10626": "I swear on Merlin's wand, the goblins will return, and stronger than before. Our hamlet is not safe.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10627": "Does anyone know how he died? Seemed healthy enough. Such mysterious circumstances.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10629": "I wonder what happened to make that Dugbog act so strangely.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10630": "I wonder what happened to make that Dugbog act so strangely. Glad it's been captured.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10631": "I've seen more activity than usual near that goblin mine. Hope it's not to do with the rebellion.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10633": "We had considered moving away. We're perfectly thrilled that we won't need to now.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10634": "It's unacceptable. Who do they think they are?",
  "AdultFemaleD_10635": "Oh, how I despise the Hairy-Handed Troll. I live in constant fear. He's all I think about.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10636": "Oh, how I dreamt of this day, when the threat of that troll would cease to linger over us.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10639": "I hope that having such a prominent Auror in our midst doesn't attract the attention of sinister forces.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10640": "Oh, Helen. Why did you have to tempt fate? Why would you go back to Azkaban?",
  "AdultFemaleD_10641": "I almost feel sorry for that troll living in the train tunnel. It's not long for this world.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10642": "That troll likely never knew what hit it, if in fact it was the train that spelled its demise.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10643": "No one can charm a hairstyle like me. Smooth as a Mooncalf.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10644": "I was top of my class all through my years at Hogwarts.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10645": "If any Dark wizards come around Hogsmeade, I'll give them something to sniff at.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10646": "Practisers of the Dark Arts should stick to fighting amongst themselves if you ask me.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10647": "Hasn't been anyone as bad as Barnabas Deverill in a while, has there.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10648": "We've got Dark wizards these days that make Emeric the Evil look like Uric the Oddball.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10649": "Centaurs have never had much use for wizardkind, have they?",
  "AdultFemaleD_10650": "Ol' Spout-hole Spavin's been Minister for so long I don't remember who came before him.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10651": "If it weren't for the cost of things these days I'd be able to take a holiday somewhere.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10652": "When I was a girl I wanted to work with unicorns. It was a whim that passed.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10653": "I was taught that if you put in a good effort, you'll reap the rewards.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10654": "Anyone can run a shop if they inherited it.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10655": "<i>Levioso</i> and <i>Stupefy</i> combined should put any brute in their place.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10656": "<i>Revelio</i> certainly never revealed the charm of my Potions professor back when I was at school.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10657": "Not saying I don't cast the odd cleaning spell when no one's looking.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10661": "Someone should pay Catrin Haggarty a visit in that camp of hers. It's only southwest of town.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10662": "I don't have to grip my purse as tightly with Catrin Haggarty off the scene.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10663": "Someone needs to put Pergit in his place.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10664": "The world is safer now that Pergit's gone.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10665": "You don't think the troll found its way into the nearby tomb, do you?",
  "AdultFemaleD_10666": "The troll certainly couldn't have escaped from the cursed tomb. Could it? It must have met its end in there somehow.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10667": "Not a fan of the Hog's Head Inn myself. Shady lot lurking about most of the time.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10668": "Glad to live in Hogsmeade and not one of those provincial hamlets. That rivalry between Upper and Lower Hogsfield is the silliest thing I've ever seen. They're both utterly dreadful.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10669": "Not a day goes by I don't wish I'd paid better attention in Defence Against the Dark Arts. The world needs talented Aurors now more than ever.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10670": "I will say that I was relieved to have our family elf about when I was younger. Kept me from having to clear the Doxys from the curtains each spring.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10671": "We treated our house-elf quite well. She had her own chambers. They were in the cellar, but you could still see and they were her very own.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10672": "They don't seem to get along well, do they, Muggles? So many wars. Not like wizardkind. We're far more civilised.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10673": "I'm not sure Muggles appreciate how simple their lives are. Ironic, really.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10674": "My mother used to threaten us with Sleeping Draught in our Butterbeer if we didn't behave. Wore her so ragged, I swear she took some herself most nights.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10675": "My neighbour's eldest boy's taken to howling at the moon at night. She insists it's a stage he's going through but I shall be keeping my distance, I can tell you that.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10676": "It's no wonder parents are exhausted all the time. I shall pour myself a Firewhisky the minute I get home and bask in the glorious peace of a childless abode.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10677": "I can almost always spot a student who's just come from History of Magic. It's as though Professor Binns drains the life out of them with his droning monologues on goblin rebellions.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10678": "Don't know when students began arriving by flying carriage to Hogwarts, but after that dragon attack I'd wager they'll stick to boats and trains.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10679": "I do trust Augustus Hill's eye when it comes to fashion, truly, but I do wonder if he doesn't try to oversell a bit. I left Gladrags last week with four new hats when I only went in for three.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10680": "I so enjoy chatting to Thomas Brown, but I'll never understand his fixation with Muggle Christmas carols. Perhaps it's the antiquated language that fascinates him? Or the melodious dins.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10681": "I must say I admire Sirona Ryan, the way she welcomes all types into the Three Broomsticks. So rare to see goblins and wizards socialising together. Makes a nice change.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10682": "How are we supposed to live with that Rampant Dugbog always coming around?",
  "AdultFemaleD_10683": "Perhaps I'll move somewhere without Dugbogs.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10684": "Will we ever feel safe again in our own home?",
  "AdultFemaleD_10686": "Letting off some steam, are we?",
  "AdultFemaleD_10687": "That what they're teaching at Hogwarts these days?",
  "AdultFemaleD_10688": "Oh dear, remind me not to cross you.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10689": "I never tire of seeing brooms flying about.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10690": "I'd much prefer to Apparate than ever get on a broom.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10691": "Flying's never been my forte. Shame though. Looks quite thrilling if you can get the hang of it.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10692": "(gasp) A Graphorn! And a – student?",
  "AdultFemaleD_10693": "You can control that thing?",
  "AdultFemaleD_10694": "Don't let that thing near me!",
  "AdultFemaleD_10695": "Is that Hippogriff their – pet?",
  "AdultFemaleD_10696": "I've never seen a Hippogriff so close to here. It's a bit – frightening.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10697": "Where would someone even get a Hippogriff?",
  "AdultFemaleD_10700": "Thank Merlin I wasn't in Hogsmeade when those dreadful trolls were on the loose. Wouldn't have known what to do.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10701": "Trolls attacking Hogsmeade! It's unheard of!",
  "AdultFemaleD_10702": "My home was nearly destroyed by trolls – what's next?",
  "AdultFemaleD_10703": "Thought I saw a troll print near Hogsmeade again. Put me well on edge, that did.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10704": "Wish those trolls would've destroyed the shop. Could've done with a day off.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10705": "Can't believe Hogwarts is still standing.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10706": "Ranrok's Loyalists were no match for the best and brightest of Hogwarts.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10707": "Every Hogwarts school year has its dramatic moments. This year seems to have gone a bit overboard.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10708": "Where was the Ministry when goblins were digging under Hogwarts?",
  "AdultFemaleD_10709": "Seems old Arn is back in business. Glad to hear he found his cart.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10710": "Now that Harlow's reign of terror is over, we can all rest easy.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10711": "I doubt anyone in Cragcroft'll miss Silvanus Selwyn.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10712": "Can't believe someone actually listened to Clementine Willardsey's ravings about butterflies.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10713": "It's the Troll Vanquisher!",
  "AdultFemaleD_10714": "I heard poor Alfred Lawley was robbed. Nothing stolen but some plants, thank Merlin.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10715": "The great Troll Slayer is amongst us!",
  "AdultFemaleD_10716": "Johanna Bickle can't keep track of her own child. Needs Hogwarts students to do it for her! (laughs)",
  "AdultFemaleD_10717": "Seems Miss Coffey's Niffler has returned. All my pocket change has gone missing.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10718": "I swear on my mother's grave, the statue near Irondale looks different than before.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10719": "Feldcroft, attacked! Again! Relieved that Sallow boy and his friend were there.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10720": "Who'd've thought Hogsmeade would be saved by a student rather than the Ministry?",
  "AdultFemaleD_10721": "That dreadful portrait's back. And conversation in the Three Broomsticks is once again unbearable. ",
  "AdultFemaleD_10722": "You're not going to – eat it – are you?",
  "AdultFemaleD_10723": "I adore watching how people flood out of the Hog's Head once they realise Pratt's hung back up inside.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10724": "Finally, some peace and quiet at the Three Broomsticks. Let's hope Pratt never comes back.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10725": "(gasp) Was that – what I think it was?",
  "AdultFemaleD_10726": "You dare do that? Here?",
  "AdultFemaleD_10727": "Dark Magic! At me?",
  "AdultFemaleD_10728": "Argh! Are – are you trying to kill me?",
  "AdultFemaleD_10729": "Oh, I always get myself locked out too.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10730": "Not opening something you shouldn't, are you?",
  "AdultFemaleD_10731": "Lock yourself out?",
  "AdultFemaleD_10735": "I hear you've been putting the Ashwinders in their place. Well done.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10736": "Not even Ranrok's Loyalists are a match for you, are they?",
  "AdultFemaleD_10737": "Ay! Watch it.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10738": "You sure you know how to handle that wand of yours?",
  "AdultFemaleD_10739": "Have you learned nothing about wand etiquette at that school?",
  "AdultFemaleD_10740": "Argh! Keep that away from me.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10741": "Glad you're giving those poachers what they deserve!",
  "AdultFemaleD_10742": "Charmed any Trolls lately? Like a snake charmer, you are – only with Trolls!",
  "AdultFemaleD_10743": "Merlin only knows if that Acromantula is the last of Aranshire's spider problems. ",
  "AdultFemaleD_10775": "Pardon me.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10776": "Doesn't Hogwarts teach manners anymore?",
  "AdultFemaleD_10777": "Hmph. Seems a Grindylow's on the loose.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10778": "What could she possibly offer? A chocolate frog?",
  "AdultFemaleD_10779": "I've always wanted to see a centaur, and now I they could be living near me.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10780": "Wonder where Johanna's boy's off to. Bit of a dreamer, that one.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10781": "Bested by a Niffler. Poor Catrin, taking all the blame.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10782": "No better cure for the stormy cold weather than a little Firewhisky in your tea.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10783": "I do so love to sit at our window and watch the rain sweep across the sea.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10784": "Don't get me started on how difficult it is to find school supplies for my children. Hogwarts is so particular with their list each year.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10785": "I would much prefer to do my shopping in Diagon Alley, but even after I Apparate there, it takes far too long to get around.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10786": "The only beach scavenging I do is for mussels. Although it is a bit sad watching them boil.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10787": "Can you fathom that cramped city living, with no space to move about? Extension Charms couldn't do enough.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10788": "I have an extra bottle of Skele-Gro, if anyone needs it. Comes in handy for broken bones.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10789": "I had to tend to Harold's wounds yesterday after he got mixed up with a nasty Grindylow in the water.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10790": "I do love to reminisce about days gone by. Wish I had a Pensieve to see my memories more clearly.",
  "AdultFemaleD_10791": "Lately, I've found myself yearning for the family holidays we used to take when I was young. I miss Romania. The dragons, not so much.",

  "AdultMaleA_10451": "Need I remind you that you are studying at Hogwarts and not the Three Broomsticks? You'll never become an Auror at this rate!",
  "AdultMaleA_10452": "You! It took us three days to find your brother, and your mother almost squashed him first.",
  "AdultMaleA_10453": "Foolish child! Do you have any idea how many Muggles the Ministry had to Obliviate to cover up your actions?",
  "AdultMaleA_10454": "You miserable lout! Your sister has been in St Mungo's for three days and she's still vomiting slugs!",
  "AdultMaleA_10455": "(raspberry)",
  "AdultMaleA_10473": "So get your head out of your Butterbeer and into a blasted wizarding book, for Merlin's sake!",
  "AdultMaleA_10474": "You know how much she hates dung beetles! But I bet that's why you did it, eh?",
  "AdultMaleA_10475": "Let's see how much you like being turned into an insect next time you test my temper.",
  "AdultMaleA_10476": "You could have been killed. You could have exposed us all! If I lose my job, it will be you to blame.",
  "AdultMaleA_10477": "If you ever point your wand at your family again, mark my words, you will lose that wand.",
  "AdultMaleA_10478": "We should get a portrait of a Graphorn and put them side by side!",
  "AdultMaleA_10479": "I heard that Ferdinand was back – had to come and see it for myself.",
  "AdultMaleA_10497": "I do believe that was the Headmaster who just walked by.",
  "AdultMaleA_10500": "I'm not fond of Rookwood and his lot. I wish they'd stay well clear of Marunweem. We've naught to do with his type.",
  "AdultMaleA_10591": "Now there's a student who knows how to fly.",
  "AdultMaleA_10592": "Merlin's beard. That's a sight I never expected to see.",
  "AdultMaleA_10593": "Oh, dear. Now that can't be safe, can it.",
  "AdultMaleA_10598": "Interesting attire.",
  "AdultMaleA_10599": "Were you robbed? Or was getting dressed simply not worth the trouble?",
  "AdultMaleA_10641": "I was right to be wary of that old manor! Corpses in the cellar, so I hear!",
  "AdultMaleA_10644": "Do spiders need to cast their webs all over?",
  "AdultMaleA_10645": "Not a moment after we clear out the spiders, and Milo goes and finds a different one to get eaten by.",
  "AdultMaleA_10646": "Those poachers make for poor neighbours.",
  "AdultMaleA_10647": "Lower Hogsfield is in a much less desirable location than Upper Hogsfield.",
  "AdultMaleA_10648": "I can't say I miss that Dugbog. Not in the least.",
  "AdultMaleA_10651": "Belgruff the Bludgeoner was a scourge on our hamlet. My undying gratitude to whoever finally eliminated him.",
  "AdultMaleA_10652": "They looked like Ranrok's crew to me. The situation could be worse than we ever imagined.",
  "AdultMaleA_10653": "Solomon Sallow will definitely be missed. He's been a friend to my family for years. What an awful thing.",
  "AdultMaleA_10655": "I heard someone finally caught that odd Dugbog. Turns out it was just a rumour.",
  "AdultMaleA_10656": "I heard someone finally caught that odd Dugbog. Wish it had been me.",
  "AdultMaleA_10657": "Used to be able to leave the door unlocked without a care. Not anymore – blasted Ashwinders.",
  "AdultMaleA_10658": "Clementine has always loved butterflies. Since she was a girl.",
  "AdultMaleA_10660": "The hamlet feels peaceful again – but how long will it last?",
  "AdultMaleA_10661": "What are we to do – abandon Upper Hogsfield entirely due to a few of Ranrok's Loyalists? Outrageous.",
  "AdultMaleA_10662": "I fear Claire Beaumont's brother has finally come unstuck, consorting with the likes of Rookwood and his lot.",
  "AdultMaleA_10663": "That troll is a thorn in all of our sides. Keenbridge is quickly becoming uninhabitable due to him.",
  "AdultMaleA_10664": "I feared we'd never be rid of that horrid troll. His departure – or demise – is certainly a welcome surprise.",
  "AdultMaleA_10667": "To hear Helen talk about her time in the Ministry you'd think she'd saved the entire wizarding world.",
  "AdultMaleA_10668": "I suppose we should all feel grateful to have known someone as fearless as Helen.",
  "AdultMaleA_10669": "Who's more stupid than that troll living in a train tunnel? I doubt it even knows it's in one.",
  "AdultMaleA_10670": "I could have sworn I heard a train whistle and a blood-curdling cry. That poor troll.",
  "AdultMaleA_10671": "No witch can resist my charms.",
  "AdultMaleA_10672": "One never knows when society will be thrown into the midst of unrest.",
  "AdultMaleA_10673": "Find myself scurrying home at night these days. Can't be too careful.",
  "AdultMaleA_10674": "My father always taught me to keep my wand at the ready. Mind you, he was never the same after he was attacked by a werewolf.",
  "AdultMaleA_10675": "Historically speaking, there's never been a team like this year's Cannons.",
  "AdultMaleA_10676": "Toadstool Tales always made me retch as a child.",
  "AdultMaleA_10677": "I don't know about centaurs, but there hasn't been a dragon in history worth losing a hair over.",
  "AdultMaleA_10678": "The Ministry's good work if you can get it.",
  "AdultMaleA_10679": "Pushing a plow is good, honest work but I shall leave it to the Muggles.",
  "AdultMaleA_10680": "I have a terrible curse where I can't lift tools or do work of any kind.",
  "AdultMaleA_10681": "Should be hearing back soon about the position that opened up at the Ministry. I sent my letter of inquiry last Monday.",
  "AdultMaleA_10682": "How is standing behind a till counting Knuts and Sickles considered work?",
  "AdultMaleA_10683": "Chores aren't so bad. I don't mind the odd one without magic.",
  "AdultMaleA_10684": "<i>Flipendo</i> might seem like harmless fun, but not when you've just had your hair done by Calliope Snelling.",
  "AdultMaleA_10685": "Just because you know <i>Lumos</i> doesn't mean you can't get lost.",
  "AdultMaleA_10692": "Catrin Haggarty's sitting pretty in that camp of hers with all of my harvest earnings.",
  "AdultMaleA_10693": "As they say, the only good Ashwinder is a dead one. Can't argue with that.",
  "AdultMaleA_10694": "Pergit is terrorising our trade routes.",
  "AdultMaleA_10695": "Pergit won't be missed around here.",
  "AdultMaleA_10696": "That manor's unnerving, all that mist creeping through the place. I do wonder what happened to the family.",
  "AdultMaleA_10697": "I heard what sounded like a troll bellowing in the woods the other day. Do you think it's hiding in a cave?",
  "AdultMaleA_10698": "I used to hear a troll bellow on my nightly walks, but I've not heard it in quite some time now.",
  "AdultMaleA_10699": "Hogsmeade does have charming shopkeepers. I was simply saying before that I prefer Diagon Alley on account of the wider selection of merchandise.",
  "AdultMaleA_10700": "The friendliest establishment in our village is the Hog's Head Inn. No one putting on airs and graces over a pint of Butterbeer. Not like they do at the Three Broomsticks.",
  "AdultMaleA_10701": "I know someone who grew up with three house-elves. Never had to tie a shoelace or fill a jug in his life.",
  "AdultMaleA_10702": "Any family with more than one house-elf should share, in my opinion.",
  "AdultMaleA_10703": "Relief washes over me the moment I've returned from London. Being amongst so many Muggles is exhausting.",
  "AdultMaleA_10704": "Sometimes I wonder if we really need the Statute of Secrecy. Might be nice to reach out to the Muggles for a change. Think of the good we could do.",
  "AdultMaleA_10705": "My children have been getting on my last nerve of late. 'Conjure this! Conjure that! That said, I'd stand before a Graphorn for them.",
  "AdultMaleA_10706": "I've taught my son never to raise his wand in anger. Unless, of course, he means to use it.",
  "AdultMaleA_10707": "My two couldn't be more different. If I didn't know better, I'd say one had been switched at birth.",
  "AdultMaleA_10708": "I do so enjoy the days when the children are back at Hogwarts. Gives the village a joyous burst of energy.",
  "AdultMaleA_10709": "The Herbology professor at Hogwarts could charm the scales off a dragon. I wonder what her favourite flower is.",
  "AdultMaleA_10710": "Jasper Trout may not keep a tidy tavern, but he'll carry your secrets to the grave.",
  "AdultMaleA_10711": "That young Otto Dibble at Gladrags does seem a nervous sort. Helpful, mind you, but perhaps still hasn't quite found his stride.",
  "AdultMaleA_10712": "Did you know that Ethel Wigley only uses 'fallen feathers' in her quills? That's a conscientious and kind woman if ever I've met one.",
  "AdultMaleA_10713": "When we were young, we used to try to find the Graphorn nearby. Moonminds, we were. Much wiser now.",
  "AdultMaleA_10714": "How on earth did a student tame a Graphorn? Is that even possible?",
  "AdultMaleA_10715": "That Dugbog is making it nigh-on impossible to live here, rampaging about like that.",
  "AdultMaleA_10716": "At least Milo has been avenged. Although I never really cared for him, to be honest.",
  "AdultMaleA_10717": "Milo's recklessness finally caught up to him. May he rest in peace.",
  "AdultMaleA_10718": "That's not how we did things when I was in school.",
  "AdultMaleA_10719": "Nothing like being young and in flight.",
  "AdultMaleA_10720": "I shall stick to walking, thank you very much.",
  "AdultMaleA_10721": "Surely people have more sense than to fly a Hippogriff.",
  "AdultMaleA_10722": "Now they're letting trolls into Hogsmeade.",
  "AdultMaleA_10723": "Ranrok has learned that Hogwarts is a sleeping dragon you do not want to awaken.",
  "AdultMaleA_10724": "Good to see that Arn is back in business, now that that awful Loyalist camp is gone.",
  "AdultMaleA_10725": "Somebody finally put a stop to Theophilus Harlow, and not a moment too soon.",
  "AdultMaleA_10726": "Silvanus Selwyn shan't be missed. Good riddance to him.",
  "AdultMaleA_10727": "At least Clementine Willardsey stopped harping on about her silly 'enchanted butterflies.'",
  "AdultMaleA_10728": "Alexandra Ricketts learned the hard way, you can't tame a troll.",
  "AdultMaleA_10729": "Heard there was a burglary at the Lawley place. Glad it wasn't me.",
  "AdultMaleA_10730": "Ahoy, Troll Slayer!",
  "AdultMaleA_10731": "Archie Bickle ought to stay close to his mother from now on.",
  "AdultMaleA_10732": "I'd say Agnes Coffey ought to take better care of her Niffler from now on.",
  "AdultMaleA_10733": "I say, isn't there something different about that statue near Irondale?",
  "AdultMaleA_10734": "Best to keep Feldcroft out of those Loyalists' grimy clutches, I think.",
  "AdultMaleA_10735": "Here's to you for protecting Hogsmeade from that terrifying troll.",
  "AdultMaleA_10736": "Ferdinand is back on his old wall at the Three Broomsticks, I hear.",
  "AdultMaleA_10737": "Hope you're planning to care for that beast.",
  "AdultMaleA_10738": "They won't take kindly to a prat like Ferdinand at the Hog's Head.",
  "AdultMaleA_10739": "I'm sure Jasper and that portrait Ferdinand Pratt will get along famously.",
  "AdultMaleA_10740": "The insolence!",
  "AdultMaleA_10741": "That's rather impolite, isn't it?",
  "AdultMaleA_10743": "The Ashwinders have been given a veritable thrashing, I'm told.",
  "AdultMaleA_10744": "I hear Ranrok's Loyalists finally met someone who won't put up with their antics.",
  "AdultMaleA_10745": "Why, you cheeky little bounder.",
  "AdultMaleA_10746": "The poachers have been given a proper hiding, I hear.",
  "AdultMaleA_10747": "What ho, Troll Whisperer!",
  "AdultMaleA_10748": "Aranshire's a nice place to visit again, now that the spiders are gone.",
  "AdultMaleA_10749": "Mind yourself.",
  "AdultMaleA_10750": "I'm not at ease around centaurs. Always send a chill down my spine.",
  "AdultMaleA_10751": "We Lower Hogsfield residents aren't afraid to have a bit of fun.",
  "AdultMaleA_10753": "Get in there you scabby beast!",
  "AdultMaleA_10754": "Our cottage can't withstand another gale, not without some good enchantments to shore it up.",
  "AdultMaleA_10755": "Armadillo bile has gone up in price lately. Don't know if you've noticed. They're gouging us at every turn.",
  "AdultMaleA_10756": "Tide always washes up peculiar things on our shores. You never know what you'll find.",
  "AdultMaleA_10757": "Do you think it's true that Muggles put notes in bottles and throw them out to sea? Sounds daft. But a bit romantic.",
  "AdultMaleA_10758": "Cheeky tourists wandering around of late, always asking about our 'quaint' country legends and whatnot.",
  "AdultMaleA_10759": "If this weather keeps up, I may need to brew myself a Pepper-Up Potion to help with the chill.",
  "AdultMaleA_10760": "I remember playing Ring Around the Runespoor as children, pretending sticks were our wands.",
  "AdultMaleA_10761": "Hearing those old fairy tales, like Babbitty Rabbitty, takes me back to sitting by the fire, hot Butterbeer in hand.",
  "AdultMaleB_00031": "(frustrated grunt)",

  "AdultMaleB_10368": "Merlin’s beard, what do you think you’re doing?",
  "AdultMaleB_10440": "Ahem. Let there be no misgivings here; I always knew you were a troublemaker. But a thief?",
  "AdultMaleB_10441": "I will have you know that your so-called pets were found spinning webs in your mother's shoes this morning.",
  "AdultMaleB_10442": "How many times must I tell you? We are a Chudley Cannons family. We do not support Puddlemere United!",
  "AdultMaleB_10443": "You little vandal! Do you know how much distress you caused? Portraits have feelings too!",
  "AdultMaleB_10444": "(raspberry)",
  "AdultMaleB_10465": "A thief who would steal from their own father, no less! How could you? How could you?",
  "AdultMaleB_10466": "I have no more words, only my disappointment. You are no child of mine.",
  "AdultMaleB_10467": "This is ludicrous. I am putting my foot down, quite literally – on anything I see with eight legs!",
  "AdultMaleB_10468": "If I find one more of their mementos on your wall, you'll be on the first train home to take it down!",
  "AdultMaleB_10470": "It's taken hours to de-moustache your aunt Mildred! Merlin's blight, child. Anyone would think you were half your age. Now grow up.",
  "AdultMaleB_10471": "(laughter)",
  "AdultMaleB_10472": "I can see the appeal for Muggles. I really can.",
  "AdultMaleB_10473": "Very quaint. Really quite charming.",
  "AdultMaleB_10475": "Perhaps you should summon your wits and find out! ",
  "AdultMaleB_10476": "Whatever happened to the last portrait we had? Poor chap –",
  "AdultMaleB_10477": "Doesn't know where he's not wanted, that portrait.",
  "AdultMaleB_10495": "I've never known a headmaster to appear quite so – quickly.",
  "AdultMaleB_10499": "I heard that someone's been consorting with poachers – or was it the Ashwinders? I can't remember.",
  "AdultMaleB_10568": "There was a time when I could do that.",
  "AdultMaleB_10569": "Well, that's not safe at all, is it?",
  "AdultMaleB_10570": "A Hippogriff? What on earth has got into this generation?",
  "AdultMaleB_10575": "What's that you're wearing? Pyjamas?",
  "AdultMaleB_10576": "Such interesting attire.",
  "AdultMaleB_10617": "Why would you leave a manor like that? With all the heirlooms? Something awful happened there.",
  "AdultMaleB_10618": "Imagine quarantining your entire family in the cellar, only to die there, trapped together?",
  "AdultMaleB_10621": "Next time I hope the spiders do their marauding somewhere else.",
  "AdultMaleB_10623": "I don't suppose we could send that Rampant Dugbog a bill for all of the damage it's caused?",
  "AdultMaleB_10624": "The sun rises on Upper Hogsfield and sets on Lower Hogsfield.",
  "AdultMaleB_10625": "When the forest calls, I must take heed.",
  "AdultMaleB_10627": "Belgruff the Bludgeoner is freely tormenting everyone in Feldcroft, and what has the Ministry done? Nothing.",
  "AdultMaleB_10628": "It's about time, honestly. I'll be pleased if I never hear the name 'Belgruff' again.",
  "AdultMaleB_10629": "We just rebuilt the hamlet from Ranrok's last attack. What's the point of more repairs? They'll only do it again.",
  "AdultMaleB_10630": "I asked Anne if she knew how her uncle died, but she didn't want to speak of it. Still in shock, I'd imagine.",
  "AdultMaleB_10632": "If there's one wild Dugbog out there, certainly more are wandering about.",
  "AdultMaleB_10633": "If there was one wild Dugbog out there, certainly more are wandering about.",
  "AdultMaleB_10635": "Pfft. Obsession with butterflies – or any bit of 'nature' for that matter. Waste of time in my opinion.",
  "AdultMaleB_10637": "It's a bit odd that we all owe our safety to a Hogwarts student, isn't it?",
  "AdultMaleB_10638": "Why are we merely standing by as Ranrok's Loyalists terrorise our home?",
  "AdultMaleB_10639": "Beaumont hoping Dark wizards would help solve the problem with Ranrok's Loyalists – foolish.",
  "AdultMaleB_10640": "That troublesome troll has a hoard of items he's taken from us. Someone must do something about him.",
  "AdultMaleB_10641": "I ought to search through the items in the troll's hoard. Bet there are treasures to be found amongst his collection.",
  "AdultMaleB_10644": "Helen's gone on and on about that one last mystery she couldn't solve. I heard her talking to a painting about it.",
  "AdultMaleB_10645": "Helen didn't deserve to be attacked. By someone she was trying to help, no less.",
  "AdultMaleB_10646": "I suppose there's a chance the troll living in that tunnel may derail the train.",
  "AdultMaleB_10647": "Serves the troll right for settling itself on train tracks.",
  "AdultMaleB_10655": "I've been told I have a winning smile.",
  "AdultMaleB_10656": "I could show the Chudley Cannons a thing or two about proper Chasing form.",
  "AdultMaleB_10657": "My advice when dealing with untoward matters is, in for a Knut, in for a Galleon.",
  "AdultMaleB_10658": "Gormlaith Gaunt was the sort who'd flay her own mother.",
  "AdultMaleB_10659": "If it's not one thing it's the other.",
  "AdultMaleB_10660": "I wonder what Merlin would think of the wizarding world today.",
  "AdultMaleB_10661": "The Tales of Beedle the Bard still ring true today.",
  "AdultMaleB_10662": "House-elves are wizardkind's best friend. Always have been.",
  "AdultMaleB_10663": "I'd take up Herbology if it didn't involve so much dung.",
  "AdultMaleB_10664": "I had plenty of opportunity to pursue anything I wanted. Good brain. That's what the teachers would say.",
  "AdultMaleB_10665": "The secret is, do the hard work first and let the easy bits take care of themselves.",
  "AdultMaleB_10666": "A full day's work clears the mind, I say.",
  "AdultMaleB_10667": "Hard work and good luck go hand in hand. And the odd charm or two.",
  "AdultMaleB_10668": "What’s the point of toiling if it can be done with magic?",
  "AdultMaleB_10669": "I met a girl once, looked like an Inferius. Pretty though. Didn't eat much.",
  "AdultMaleB_10670": "You can stop a thief in their tracks with <i>Stupefy</i>. Or just run of course.",
  "AdultMaleB_10671": "Where's that incessant flapping coming from?",
  "AdultMaleB_10675": "Catrin Haggarty would rob the milk from your tea.",
  "AdultMaleB_10676": "I'll have Galleons to spare now that Catrin Haggarty's not here to rob them.",
  "AdultMaleB_10677": "Pergit's made a mess of our trade routes.",
  "AdultMaleB_10678": "It's nice to stroll down the road without worrying about Pergit.",
  "AdultMaleB_10679": "I could defend myself against a troll. I was the best duellist in Hogwarts back in my day.",
  "AdultMaleB_10680": "Perhaps I took care of the troll for all of you. No need to thank me.",
  "AdultMaleB_10681": "Diagon Alley's selection is impressive of course, but I prefer the convenience and safety of our High Street.",
  "AdultMaleB_10682": "My poor Susan was once the victim of a Pimple Jinx at school. If Mr Pippin hadn't had freshly brewed Cure for Boils on hand, I don't know what we would've done. That man is a saint.",
  "AdultMaleB_10683": "I prefer to do my own housework. I have a wand for goodness's sake.",
  "AdultMaleB_10684": "Children from homes with more than one house-elf are rarely self-sufficient though, are they?",
  "AdultMaleB_10685": "What do you suppose Muggles would make of our dependence upon house-elves?",
  "AdultMaleB_10686": "Caught a glimpse of some Muggles the other day, hitting a little white ball around a large mowed field. Muggle sports seem about as exciting as a bowl of porridge.",
  "AdultMaleB_10687": "Caught my little one prancing about the kitchen with a wooden spoon the other day – 'casting' away at the siblings he was, to keep them in check. He'll be Minister for Magic one day, you mark my words.",
  "AdultMaleB_10688": "My parents finally installed a fireplace. I was thrilled, except now that they're connected to the Floo Network, I'm expected to bring the children for dinner every Sunday. I wouldn't mind but it's an awful roast they cook.",

  "AdultMaleB_10690": "One thing's for certain: you can't blame the students for leaving the castle at every opportunity. That headmaster is a most cantankerous chap.",
  "AdultMaleB_10691": "I saw the Hogwarts caretaker the other day at the Three Broomsticks. Gladwin Moon I think his name is. Regaling everyone with his tales, he was. You'd think he was captain of the Chudley Cannons the way he goes on.",
  "AdultMaleB_10692": "Does my heart good to see young Albie Weekes making a go of it at Spintwitches. Very knowledgeable young man, that one.",
  "AdultMaleB_10693": "Thomas Brown is a marvel, I tell you. I was looking for an impossible-to-find book on werewolves, – no need to ask why – and he found a copy for me before the next full moon. No need to look scared.",

  "AdultMaleB_10700": "Imagine encountering a real Acromantula. Should think I'd die simply looking at the thing.",
  "AdultMaleB_10701": "They'll be vital. Another attack is imminent.",
  "AdultMaleB_10702": "How good of Miss Moffett – looking out for those poor Diricawls.",

  "AdultMaleB_10818": "Nicely done with that beast.",
  "AdultMaleB_10825": "Oh, there's no one that natters on like that blasted portrait of Ferdinand Pratt.",
  "AdultMaleB_10832": "Ferdinand Pratt is at the Hog's Head now? Suppose I shall be keeping to the Three Broomsticks then.",
  "AdultMaleB_10839": "That could cause serious harm.",
  "AdultMaleB_10846": "Awful inconvenience to get locked out, I know.",
  "AdultMaleB_10860": "Hm. Perhaps the Ashwinders have moved on.",
  "AdultMaleB_10867": "Ranrok's Loyalists can't keep us in fear forever. Certainly less of them about of late.",

  "AdultMaleB_10888": "All hail the Troll Whisperer!",

  "AdultMaleB_10902": "Don't mind me.",
  "AdultMaleB_10909": "Lot of pent-up energy in this one.",
  "AdultMaleB_10916": "There'll be a storm blowing in from the ocean soon. All the Fwoopers have taken flight.",

  "AdultMaleC_10440": "Do you even comprehend how expensive that broom was? Breaking your own belongings is one thing –",
  "AdultMaleC_10441": "Smuggling spiders into school! I jolly well hope it was worth the months of detentions you earned yourself.",
  "AdultMaleC_10442": "(raspberry)",
  "AdultMaleC_10462": "Your mother is devastated! No more homework that isn't written in a book, do you hear me? No more!",

  "AdultMaleC_10635": "All this talk about a silly Dugbog. It's only a Dugbog. Could be much worse. Could be a Horntail.",
  "AdultMaleC_10636": "That Selwyn chap even thinks about stealing from me and I'll have my wand at the ready in a second.",
  "AdultMaleC_10639": "Strange, isn't it? Horrid goblin problem one day, gone the next.",

  "AdultMaleC_10647": "Imagine spending your entire career as an Auror only to return to Upper Hogsfield.",
  "AdultMaleC_10648": "How could this have happened? Didn't Helen's training with the Ministry prepare her for such a ruthless attack?",
  "AdultMaleC_10649": "Don't wander too near the tunnel. There's a troll living there.",
  "AdultMaleC_10650": "Well now we know who would win in a fight between a stupid troll and a thousand tonne locomotive.",
  "AdultMaleC_10651": "There's not many don't fear me.",
  "AdultMaleC_10652": "If I had a Knut for every Graphorn I chased off –",
  "AdultMaleC_10653": "I don't see why everyone has their wand in a knot about the Dark Arts. It's pushing the boundaries of magic.",
  "AdultMaleC_10654": "What's more powerful than the Dark Arts? Not even love I reckon.",
  "AdultMaleC_10655": "It's a good thing we have Aurors is all I'm saying.",
  "AdultMaleC_10656": "If anyone ever knew how to keep Muggles out, it was Hengist of Woodcroft.",
  "AdultMaleC_10657": "Beedle the Bard is a bit too hairy hearted for my tastes.",

  "AdultMaleC_10659": "I should think a house-elf doesn't work as hard as me. And sometimes I have to wonder, for what?",
  "AdultMaleC_10660": "No need for Sleeping Draught for me. Proper day's work and I sleep like a baby Mooncalf.",
  "AdultMaleC_10661": "Being an officer of the law in a quiet village like Hogsmeade is a pleasant job I'd say. Wish I'd thought of it.",
  "AdultMaleC_10662": "You'll not cast successfully if you don't first see it happen in your own mind.",
  "AdultMaleC_10663": "I wish I'd paid more attention when I was at Hogwarts.",
  "AdultMaleC_10664": "Who needs keys when you know <i>Alohomora</i>?",
  "AdultMaleC_10665": "My mother used to say I was lazy. Wouldn't pick up my toys she said. Her own fault for teaching me <i>Accio</i>.",
  "AdultMaleC_10670": "Catrin Haggarty has more of my Galleons than Gringotts.",
  "AdultMaleC_10671": "Catrin Haggarty must be a disappointment to her brother, I reckon.",
  "AdultMaleC_10672": "Things are so bad you can't walk down the road without fear of Pergit and his minions.",
  "AdultMaleC_10673": "I miss Pergit about as much as a Horklump.",
  "AdultMaleC_10674": "There's an abandoned tomb near where people have been hearing that troll.",
  "AdultMaleC_10675": "Certainly no one dared venture into the cursed tomb to defeat the troll.",
  "AdultMaleC_10676": "I honestly don't know how two Herbology shops can prosper in one village. People must be brewing an inordinate amount of potions.",
  "AdultMaleC_10677": "I adore living in Hogsmeade. For a lark, I sometimes row about the Black Lake – see if I can spot the elusive Giant Squid.",
  "AdultMaleC_10678": "I wouldn't mind a job at that Alchemy Centre in Egypt. Always been good at Potions and the like. Seems a natural fit for me.",
  "AdultMaleC_10679": "I try not to judge what others do in their own homes. One never knows how slovenly another's family may be.",
  "AdultMaleC_10680": "I've dined in your house and I can say that the experience would've been much more pleasant had you had a house-elf in the kitchen.",
  "AdultMaleC_10681": "Astonishing, really, that apart from those lucky enough to have a witch or wizard in the family, the Muggle world has never truly realised we exist.",
  "AdultMaleC_10682": "Muggle money makes no sense to me at all. Shillings. Sounds more like an ailment. Give me good old-fashioned Galleons and Sickles any day.",
  "AdultMaleC_10683": "Happiest day of my life was when my wife and I found out my daughter was a witch. Little did we know what we were in for!",
  "AdultMaleC_10684": "What breeds successful young witches and wizards isn't blood purity, it's love. And a healthy respect for magic.",
  "AdultMaleC_10685": "I’m a bit worried that my nephew's a Squib. Sits there like a lump every Christmas while all the other children have to be constantly reminded to put away their wands. Not saying I mind, of course.",
  "AdultMaleC_10686": "I think we're getting a lot more trade from the Hogwarts students this year, what with Quidditch being cancelled. Poor children have nothing else to do with their spare time.",
  "AdultMaleC_10687": "Oh it's been ages since I've been up to the castle myself. It'd be lovely to visit Hogwarts again – but not while they have that old curmudgeon as headmaster.",
  "AdultMaleC_10688": "Don't know how that Ollivander fellow does it. Always seems to find the perfect wand for each customer. Course, his family been making wands for centuries.",
  "AdultMaleC_10689": "Have any of you been by Calliope Snelling's lately? Does wonders for one's image to have a styling done by her. Not saying any of you need it. Merely suggesting.",
  "AdultMaleC_10690": "Whenever I'm feeling out of sorts, the first person I see is Parry Pippin.",
  "AdultMaleC_10691": "Why would a Graphorn wander the shore here? Doesn't seem there's much to do.",
  "AdultMaleC_10692": "Why would someone choose to ride a Graphorn? Seems awfully cumbersome. I'd choose a broom any day.",
  "AdultMaleC_10693": "Whoever got rid of that Dugbog, we owe them dearly.",
  "AdultMaleC_10695": "Size holds no virtue in Quidditch. It's about having a sharp mind and a sharp eye.",
  "AdultMaleC_10696": "Oh, you don't say.",
  "AdultMaleC_10697": "Steady on, there. No need for that sort of talk.",
  "AdultMaleC_10698": "I've tried everything; trips to London, holidays by the sea. All she wants to do is read Muggle romance novels.",
  "AdultMaleC_10699": "I wouldn't mind if that was the case. I bought her a magnificent quill set not a week ago.",
  "AdultMaleC_10700": "About the only thing she's done is scrawl the name of a third-year Hufflepuff all over her potions book.",
  "AdultMaleC_10701": "It's not that I'm worried about. It's that I've started reading the blasted Muggle books myself. Every one of them's absolutely marvellous.",
  "AdultMaleC_10702": "It is, yes, I'd have to agree.",
  "AdultMaleC_10703": "She's right. I'd be thrilled if mine took half so well.",
  "AdultMaleC_10704": "Well I'd never've thought of that.",
  "AdultMaleC_10705": "Hm – I shall have to try worm castings.",
  "AdultMaleC_10706": "Mmmm.",
  "AdultMaleC_10707": "And then she had the gumption to leave a brochure on my writing desk.",
  "AdultMaleC_10708": "A brochure.",
  "AdultMaleC_10709": "You've never seen so many Muggles. And why they flock to the sea; not one of them can swim.",
  "AdultMaleC_10710": "Well that's just the thing, you see.",
  "AdultMaleC_10711": "She wants to go on her own.",
  "AdultMaleC_10712": "How has he earned it when that blasted headmaster has cancelled the confounded game?",
  "AdultMaleC_10713": "What did you get him then, your son?",
  "AdultMaleC_10714": "My daughter's just the same. Nose in romance novels and not a care about her studies. Sheer laziness it is.",
  "AdultMaleC_10715": "I'll have you know I knew antidotes to common poisons before I was five.",
  "AdultMaleC_10716": "What's that supposed to mean?",
  "AdultMaleC_10717": "W-w-what? There's no grand or sinister truth being unearthed here. Your failing memory more like.",
  "AdultMaleC_10718": "What? R-remember what?",
  "AdultMaleC_10719": "Only what? Go on then. Since you're clearly intent on defiling my reputation as a scholar.",
  "AdultMaleC_10720": "Oh for Merlin's sake.",
  "AdultMaleC_10721": "Yes? Well go on! Don't keep us all hanging in this den of fiction.",
  "AdultMaleC_10722": "Please. Can we get back to this tale that seems to allude to unsavoury actions involving unicorn horn?",
  "AdultMaleC_10723": " Wh – how dare you?",
  "AdultMaleC_10724": "I am not a thief and I should think such inflammatory words could find a wizard in Azkaban!",
  "AdultMaleC_10725": "Could you please be less dramatic?",
  "AdultMaleC_10726": "What? Well then this is hardly a crime is it? Why are we even talking about this? This is absurd.",
  "AdultMaleC_10727": "Merlin, give me strength.",
  "AdultMaleC_10728": "All I know is there's always a lot of tea leaves left in the cup.",
  "AdultMaleC_10729": "Yes. I'm sure I could. If I had the time of day or a remotely moderate belief in Divination.",
  "AdultMaleC_10730": "Isn't there already enough in life to ponder over without adding the debris of dead herbs into the fray?",
  "AdultMaleC_10731": "Oh for goodness's sake, stop filling people's minds with fear.",
  "AdultMaleC_10732": "And what makes you say that?",
  "AdultMaleC_10733": "What were you doing with a fish anyway?  Seems a rather Muggle thing to do. Keep a fish.",
  "AdultMaleC_10734": "Lottie Featherbottom's the one that started it all.",
  "AdultMaleC_10735": "Yeah. Talking about how her sister had been to Swansea and had a lovely time.",
  "AdultMaleC_10736": "Yes I'm sure there are. For those that have the time to sit staring at a large body of water.",
  "AdultMaleC_10737": "Well, she didn't have to say she had a 'lovely time'. Now it's all I hear about. 'Why don't we go anywhere?'. ",
  "AdultMaleC_10738": "Oh don't you start.",
  "AdultMaleC_10739": "That's the first useful thing you've said. That's what I'll say.",
  "AdultMaleC_10740": "I shall say there's some sort of terrible beast been seen in the waters there. In Swansea.",
  "AdultMaleC_10741": "What's say I send you to Swansea and you can come back and tell my wife all about it?",
  "AdultMaleC_10742": "Oh Merlin's beard.",
  "AdultMaleC_10743": "I'm not sure I'd call six o'clock 'all hours'.",
  "AdultMaleC_10744": "What does he do? When you suggest that he go for a good walk?",
  "AdultMaleC_10745": "Oh, that's rather naughty. Sounds as if the issue is one of discipline rather than the age at which one can do magic.",
  "AdultMaleC_10746": "Oh? I have brass. Quite acceptable.",
  "AdultMaleC_10747": "Why do you say it like that? 'Oh.'  Oh, what?",
  "AdultMaleC_10748": "She said, 'Oh'. In an unkindly way.",
  "AdultMaleC_10749": "I wasn't accusing anyone of being unkind. I had simply felt there was a tone. That's all.",
  "AdultMaleC_10750": "And you still haven't answered my question. About my cauldron. My brass cauldron.",
  "AdultMaleC_10751": "I'd hardly call that a lecture.",
  "AdultMaleC_10752": "N-no. I've a mind to speak to the owner myself, next time I'm passing by Ceridwen's.",
  "AdultMaleC_10753": "I shall get my information from the source and ask if indeed brass is slower than copper.",
  "AdultMaleC_10754": "Yes. Why don't you.",
  "AdultMaleC_10755": "Good. Do you, uh, oil your pot before you use it?",
  "AdultMaleC_10756": "Albie Weekes is behind this, I know he is.",
  "AdultMaleC_10757": "Yes. Albie Weekes at Spintwitches. Talking all about how a faster broom would allow her to see more.",
  "AdultMaleC_10758": "More of the countryside. He says if she flies faster she'll be able get further than usual – and see more.",
  "AdultMaleC_10759": "Well, it's all I hear about now, isn't it? 'Travel', 'We can travel', 'Why don't we travel?'. It's affecting my nerves.",
  "AdultMaleC_10760": "No I don't think I might faint, or though I shall if she keeps on like she is.",
  "AdultMaleC_10761": "Well! It's my broom isn't it? I'm worried I shan't keep up with her.",
  "AdultMaleC_10762": "He's certainly dedicated to his training, at least if you include sitting drinking Butterbeers.",
  "AdultMaleC_10763": "Interesting. Sounds as if we should keep an eye out for your son when they scout new players for the Cannons.",
  "AdultMaleC_10764": "If it were my girl she'd be at home reading about Herbology, not dancing about outside Ollivanders.",
  "AdultMaleC_10765": "Oh yes? What drew you over there?",
  "AdultMaleC_10766": "A word with Ellie?",
  "AdultMaleC_10767": "Knotted?",
  "AdultMaleC_10768": "Mm. Makes sense.",
  "AdultMaleC_10769": "And? How did it go, this word?",
  "AdultMaleC_10770": "Yes? There was a what? And what did she do?",
  "AdultMaleC_10771": "Well you can't stop now. We want to hear about the Glumbumbles. I adore a good Glumbumble tale.",
  "AdultMaleC_10772": "Yes? And then what happened? Did she ingest some of it? The treacle?",
  "AdultMaleC_10773": "But what about the Puffskein hair? And the knots? What happened about that?",
  "AdultMaleC_10774": "It's most unlike her.",
  "AdultMaleC_10775": "Oh, at the very least. I swear I caught a glimpse of some Stink Pellets too. I ask, what on earth could she be up to?",
  "AdultMaleC_10776": "Yes. I suspect you're right. I told her that woman was a bad influence but she wouldn't listen. 'She's fun', she said.",
  "AdultMaleC_10777": "Doesn't bear thinking about. I can hardly sleep at night for fear I'm about to be the victim of some dreadful trick.",
  "AdultMaleC_10778": "No. Not that I can think of.",
  "AdultMaleC_10779": "Yes. It was her own birthday last week. I didn't get her anything so it'll be nice for her to be around a celebration.",
  "AdultMaleC_10780": "Madam Olivier is offering a bounty to take out Selwyn.",
  "AdultMaleC_10783": "I would not want someone like Harlow looking for me, I can tell you that much.",
  "AdultMaleC_10784": "Why did the centaurs decide to come around here, I wonder? Are they observing us?",
  "AdultMaleC_10785": "Upper Hogsfield falsely equates latitude with class.",
  "AdultMaleC_10786": "Indeed. Whoever finds that crafty Niffler will surely find his collection of treasures as well.",
  "AdultMaleC_10787": "Ah! Nothing clears the cobwebs quite like flying.",
  "AdultMaleC_10788": "Riding a Graphorn? How utterly reckless.",
  "AdultMaleC_10789": "Flying on a Hippogriff. Wonder what that's like?",
  "AdultMaleC_10792": "What in Merlin's name was a troll doing in Hogsmeade?",
  "AdultMaleC_10793": "Ranrok's reign of terror has come to a swift end.",
  "AdultMaleC_10794": "I'm certainly relieved those goblin Loyalists are gone.",
  "AdultMaleC_10795": "Theophilus Harlow was a wicked wizard. He's better off dead.",
  "AdultMaleC_10796": "Silvanus Selwyn thought living in a castle made him a lord. He got what he deserved.",
  "AdultMaleC_10797": "I agree with Mrs. Willardsey. There's always been something odd about those butterflies.",
  "AdultMaleC_10798": "Here comes the Brocburrow Troll Vanquisher!",
  "AdultMaleC_10799": "I wonder if Mr Lawley's business will survive this latest setback.",
  "AdultMaleC_10800": "Here comes the Brocburrow Troll Slayer!",
  "AdultMaleC_10801": "What's the world come to? – young Archie Bickle needing to be saved from Poachers!",
  "AdultMaleC_10802": "If Agnes Coffey can't keep track of her Niffler she has no business owning one.",
  "AdultMaleC_10803": "Am I losing my mind or did that statue near Irondale change?",
  "AdultMaleC_10804": "Brave or reckless, I'm just pleased someone saved Feldcroft from Ranrok's Loyalists.",
  "AdultMaleC_10805": "Thank you for assisting Hogsmeade with that nasty troll business.",
  "AdultMaleC_10806": "Sirona's better than most at putting up with Ferdinand. Likely best he's on the wall of the Three Broomsticks.",
  "AdultMaleC_10807": "Someone's after a pet, I think.",
  "AdultMaleC_10808": "Wonder what Jasper makes of that new portrait at the Hog's Head. Quite the telltale, apparently.",
  "AdultMaleC_10809": "One has to mind every word they say at the Hog's Head with that blasted portrait of Ferdinand hanging about.",
  "AdultMaleC_10810": "You ought to be locked up for that.",
  "AdultMaleC_10811": "Locked out? We've all been there.",
  "AdultMaleC_10813": "Seems there are fewer Ashwinders every day.",
  "AdultMaleC_10814": "Someone's certainly culled Ranrok's Loyalists.",
  "AdultMaleC_10815": "You shall hold that wand still!",
  "AdultMaleC_10816": "With fewer poachers about, perhaps we shall see more beasts.",
  "AdultMaleC_10817": "Here comes the Brocburrow Troll Tamer!",
  "AdultMaleC_10818": "Aranshire is so much lovelier without all the spiders.",
  "AdultMaleC_10819": "Do be more careful.",
  "AdultMaleC_10820": "I'd say you need to be more careful.",
  "AdultMaleC_10821": "That's it! That's it!",
  "AdultMaleC_10822": "Saw a flock of Hippogriffs flying south along the coast. Heard they do that when the weather's about to change.",
  "AdultMaleC_10824": "I know there was something I was meant to pick up in town, but it's completely slipped my mind.",
  "AdultMaleC_10825": "Our pet Kneazle is probably down on the beach as we speak. Prowling for fish and snails, he'll be.",
  "AdultMaleC_10826": "I can't imagine living anywhere else. The city-folk can keep their noise and their hubbub.",
  "AdultMaleC_10827": "Of course there's always St Mungo's, but I wouldn't mind having a local healer around for smaller matters.",
  "AdultMaleC_10828": "My father used to enchant his handmade kites to soar around our house. It was magical – till one took down mother's favourite lamp.",
  "AdultMaleD_00044": "(surprised gasp)",
  "AdultMaleD_00058": "(surprised sound)",

  "AdultMaleD_00186": "(hiccup)",
  "AdultMaleD_10351": "Is this your idea of fun?",
  "AdultMaleD_10352": "You won't hear a word from me.",
  "AdultMaleD_10423": "What in Merlin's name were you thinking, using the family owl to deliver that pitiful attempt at a poem to Beauxbatons?",
  "AdultMaleD_10424": "All those new, expensive school books we bought you, and you leave them on platform nine and three-quarters!",
  "AdultMaleD_10425": "What in Merlin's name were you doing in the Restricted Section? What did you think you would find there – answers to your exams?",
  "AdultMaleD_10426": "The Forbidden Forest? Are you trying to get yourself killed? Do you have any clue what kind of creatures live in there?",
  "AdultMaleD_10427": "(raspberry)",
  "AdultMaleD_10439": "Do you realise what kind of reputational damage you've caused? For Merlin's sake, even the owl looked ashamed.",
  "AdultMaleD_10440": "Your school years are meant for studying, not long distance dalliances! Get a hold of yourself!",
  "AdultMaleD_10441": "You are damned lucky that the station guard found them first. I'm sending a Remembrall in the post. By Merlin, don't lose that, too!",
  "AdultMaleD_10442": "If I discover even a trace of Dark Magic, I'll take you straight out of school, and that is a promise.",
  "AdultMaleD_10443": "You're lucky to be alive, but by God, when you come back you'll wish you weren't.",
  "AdultMaleD_10449": "(laughter)",
  "AdultMaleD_10450": "Whatever will they make next? Kites in the shape of the Giant Squid, I hope!",
  "AdultMaleD_10451": "Brr. Chilly breeze, mind you.",
  "AdultMaleD_10454": "A Galleon says Ferdinand screams if you shoot fire at him!",
  "AdultMaleD_10455": "Well, at least now we know to simply take his frame off the wall if he misbehaves.",
  "AdultMaleD_10472": "Professor Black, lively as ever.",
  "AdultMaleD_10476": "Dark witches and wizards looking for treasure in Marunweem? I don't like the sound of it.",
  "AdultMaleD_10547": "Well, how marvellous.",
  "AdultMaleD_10548": "Not a wise thing to do.",
  "AdultMaleD_10549": "Ha! – rather impressive.",
  "AdultMaleD_10554": "What are you wearing?",
  "AdultMaleD_10555": "The youth today. Such an embarrassment.",
  "AdultMaleD_10563": "It astounds me that goblins attacked Hogwarts. Their confidence seems to be growing all the time.",
  "AdultMaleD_10564": "Hopefully the goblins will back down a bit after their defeat at Hogwarts. They've stirred up enough trouble.",
  "AdultMaleD_10596": "Rohan Prakash, the travelling merchant, told me he's heard sounds coming from the manor. Restless spirits, perhaps?",
  "AdultMaleD_10597": "I heard that a Dark wizard had taken control of the old manor – one of Rookwood's lot. He was the one raising the dead.",
  "AdultMaleD_10601": "The important thing is that we're safe – most of us, at least.",
  "AdultMaleD_10604": "Pitt-Upon-Ford has the finest bridges in the forest.",
  "AdultMaleD_10605": "I've heard Lower Hogsfielders suggest that we change our name. The very idea.",
  "AdultMaleD_10606": "Glad I didn't move away on account of that Dugbog.",
  "AdultMaleD_10608": "If someone doesn't take care of him, I'll need to move my family. Can't wait for the Ministry to act.",
  "AdultMaleD_10609": "I never encountered Belgruff myself, but I sense that a great weight has been lifted.",
  "AdultMaleD_10610": "The Sallows put up quite a fight. Did you see how they countered those goblins? We were lucky to have them.",
  "AdultMaleD_10611": "Anne's not doing well at all. Poor thing. She and Solomon were very close.",
  "AdultMaleD_10613": "My friend insists we track down that Dugbog. Not sure about her scheme. She may have been kicked in the head.",
  "AdultMaleD_10614": "My friend wants to find more Dugbogs now that one's been captured. Absurd. Simply absurd.",
  "AdultMaleD_10615": "Have you seen some of these goblins lately? Some sort of Dark Magic going on there. I'm sure of it.",
  "AdultMaleD_10617": "It was a difficult time for all of us. What a relief to finally be done with it.",
  "AdultMaleD_10618": "I shall move my family out of Upper Hogsfield if need be. I won't have them living in fear.",
  "AdultMaleD_10619": "It would likely take all of us working together, but certainly we can outwit that troll. One would think.",
  "AdultMaleD_10620": "It's a new dawn for Keenbridge thanks to whoever dispatched that awful troll.",
  "AdultMaleD_10624": "I reckon Eddie's glad to have his sister so near again, and that she made it out of her adventurous life in one piece.",
  "AdultMaleD_10625": "Such an awful thing. Attacked by a prisoner. Helen didn't deserve that.",
  "AdultMaleD_10626": "I'd like to tell the troll to get itself out of the tunnel, but I fear it may attack me.",
  "AdultMaleD_10627": "It could be there are other forces at work. Perhaps the train didn't kill our local troll.",
  "AdultMaleD_10628": "I've the fastest wand this side of Durmstrang.",
  "AdultMaleD_10629": "I wouldn't trade my wand for all the Chomping Cabbage in China.",
  "AdultMaleD_10630": "I question anyone teaching Defence Against Dark Arts. Why take such an interest?",
  "AdultMaleD_10631": "Unicorn blood will keep you alive, certainly – but at what cost?",
  "AdultMaleD_10632": "Is the Knee-Reversal Hex really so sinister?",
  "AdultMaleD_10633": "Godric Gryffindor was the greatest duellist in history.",
  "AdultMaleD_10634": "Not enough reflection on the past in my opinion. The world learns from its mistakes.",
  "AdultMaleD_10635": "I wonder if they'll ever find that Golden Snitch in Bodmin Moor.",
  "AdultMaleD_10636": "An honest day's work for an honest Sickle, that's my creed.",
  "AdultMaleD_10637": "Whatever my task, I console myself knowing that some soul out there has a more unfavourable lot in life.",
  "AdultMaleD_10638": "If you work all day with your hands you're no better than a Muggle.",
  "AdultMaleD_10639": "When you find a good opportunity it's wise to seize it with both hands.",
  "AdultMaleD_10640": "The young today aren't willing to put in the work to learn magic. Too busy with Fizzing Whizzbees if you ask me.",
  "AdultMaleD_10641": "Nothing warms a body like <i>Incendio</i>. That's what my mother used to say.",
  "AdultMaleD_10642": "I can always rely on my Patronus to keep me safe. At least I think so.",
  "AdultMaleD_10646": "My coffers have never been so empty, thanks to that Catrin Haggarty.",
  "AdultMaleD_10647": "Whoever got rid of Catrin Haggarty is a hero in my book.",
  "AdultMaleD_10648": "Someone needs to stand up to Pergit. Everyone knows where he is: those nearby ruins.",
  "AdultMaleD_10649": "It's good to see trade resuming without Pergit's lot getting in the way.",
  "AdultMaleD_10650": "The tomb in the woods is cursed. If a troll got in, he's certainly not getting out.",
  "AdultMaleD_10651": "Who would have been brave enough to take on a troll by themselves? Certainly no one from Brocburrow.",
  "AdultMaleD_10652": "I do enjoy the Magic Neep. Never find much to buy but Timothy Teasdale is simply charming.",
  "AdultMaleD_10653": "Hogsmeade's always charming, of course. But at Christmas? Well, in my view there's nowhere more beautiful.",
  "AdultMaleD_10654": "I'm well-suited to counting money. I'd love a job at Gringotts if I didn't have to take one of those rickety carts round the place. Nearly vomited first time I rode one.",
  "AdultMaleD_10655": "I do wonder that more families don't have house-elves. They do seem to enjoy the work.",
  "AdultMaleD_10656": "I imagine it's a bit of a comfort to have your career laid out from birth. No worries about school or classes. There's a dignity in service isn't there?",
  "AdultMaleD_10657": "I dread the day Muggles know of wizardkind. They'll be asking for favours round the clock.",
  "AdultMaleD_10658": "We've had our fair share of blackguards and rogues in the wizarding world, of course, but I'd say we're still more civilised than  Muggles any day of the week.",
  "AdultMaleD_10659": "No need to worry about anyone ever activating the Trace at my house. Can't get my children to lift a finger, let alone a wand.",
  "AdultMaleD_10660": "Much as they exhaust me, I'm a bit sad my last one's heading to Hogwarts soon.",
  "AdultMaleD_10661": "The way my children play at duelling, I sometimes hope they all turn out to be Squibs – for their safety and mine.",
  "AdultMaleD_10662": "Could've sworn I saw one of the Hogwarts ghosts wandering near the graveyard the other day. Very strange.",
  "AdultMaleD_10663": "I overheard some students talking about Professor Ronen's teaching games. Sounded very clever. Charming man, Ronen. Wish I'd had him when I was at Hogwarts.",
  "AdultMaleD_10664": "Mind where you put your hands if you visit Dogweed and Deathcap. I was in there the other day, nearly lost a finger.",
  "AdultMaleD_10665": "What I like about Jasper Trout is that he's shifty as a Niffler and you can tell him that to his face.",
  "AdultMaleD_10666": "Ellie Peck certainly knows her beasts. Stopped me from blindly buying Kneazle fur when she knew that what I needed was Niffler fur.",
  "AdultMaleD_10669": "Thank goodness Selwyn's gone.",
  "AdultMaleD_10671": "Majestic creatures, centaurs. Always lovely to see them amongst the beasts of the forest.",
  "AdultMaleD_10672": "Lower Hogsfield may not look like much, but there's nary a livelier hamlet.",
  "AdultMaleD_10673": "Aim for the neck you scrawny lizard!",
  "AdultMaleD_10674": "Simply unheard of. What would cause a troll to do such a thing in Hogsmeade?",
  "AdultMaleD_10675": "Goblins invading Hogwarts? I never thought such a thing was even possible.",
  "AdultMaleD_10676": "You're the student who dealt with that Loyalist camp near Lower Hogsfield. That was quite a feat.",
  "AdultMaleD_10677": "You're one of the students who had Theophilus Harlow sent to Azkaban, aren't you? Marvellous work, my young friend. Marvellous.",
  "AdultMaleD_10678": "You're the one who defeated Silvanus Selwyn! We're all most grateful, I can tell you.",
  "AdultMaleD_10679": "Aren't you the one who discovered treasure in the Forbidden Forest? I should have followed those butterflies myself.",
  "AdultMaleD_10680": "Ah, yes – the renowned Troll Vanquisher, in the flesh! Well done, indeed.",
  "AdultMaleD_10681": "You're the one who found their way into Alfred Lawley's house, aren't you? Don't worry, shan't say a thing. He deserved it.",
  "AdultMaleD_10682": "Ah, yes – the renowned Troll Slayer, in the flesh! I heard about that. We all did.",
  "AdultMaleD_10683": "I know you! You're one of the students who rescued little Archie Bickle! Heroic act, that was.",
  "AdultMaleD_10684": "Aren't you the one who returned Agnes Coffey's Niffler? She was most distraught till you took it back. Very good of you.",
  "AdultMaleD_10685": "I can't quite picture what the statue looked like before, but something's different. The arms, perhaps? Puzzling, indeed.",
  "AdultMaleD_10686": "You're one of the students who defended Feldcroft when the goblins attacked, aren't you? They were fortunate the two of you were there.",
  "AdultMaleD_10687": "You defended Hogsmeade the day of the troll attack, didn't you? Such bravery in one so young.",
  "AdultMaleD_10688": "I wish you hadn't returned Ferdinand Octavius Pratt's portrait to the Three Broomsticks – as does everyone else who frequents the place.",
  "AdultMaleD_10689": "That's a good one you got there.",
  "AdultMaleD_10690": "Are you the one who hung Ferdinand Octavius Pratt's portrait at the Hog's Head Inn?  Unbearable, that one.",
  "AdultMaleD_10691": "You're the one who destroyed Ferdinand Octavius Pratt's portrait, aren't you? You did us all a favour there.",
  "AdultMaleD_10692": "The Dark Arts? What are you thinking?",
  "AdultMaleD_10693": "Yes, that spell ought to work.",
  "AdultMaleD_10695": "It may be unwise to upset the Ashwinders. That being said, they deserve all that they get.",
  "AdultMaleD_10696": "It's a good thing someone's doing something to stop those awful goblin Loyalists.",
  "AdultMaleD_10697": "Careful now. You could hurt someone.",
  "AdultMaleD_10698": "The fewer poachers we have to deal with, the better off we'll all be.",
  "AdultMaleD_10699": "You're the Troll Whisperer, aren't you? Everyone is very appreciative of what you did there.",
  "AdultMaleD_10700": "Aren't you the one who defeated that awful Acromantula near Aranshire? I'd have never gone near the thing.",
  "AdultMaleD_10701": "Oh, dear. Pardon me.",
  "AdultMaleD_10702": "Takes care of that.",
  "AdultMaleD_10703": "Can always tell when a storm's blowing in – my joints ache and my Summoning Charms pull a bit to the left.",
  "AdultMaleD_10704": "If we're due for a tempest, I'd best hurry home. Eleanor'll need help bringing in the chickens and such.",
  "AdultMaleD_10705": "Dorothy wanted me to buy her a golden cauldron. Golden! I told her she'd make do with pewter, I did.",
  "AdultMaleD_10706": "I've always wondered if there's a form of Divination to do with the pattern of shells that wash up on the beach.",
  "AdultMaleD_10707": "Retiring to the countryside was the best decision I ever made. Don't miss London or the Ministry at all.",
  "AdultMaleD_10708": "I have to admit, part of me still yearns to get back to the city someday.",
  "AdultMaleD_10709": "Have you tried Murtlap Essence for minor cuts and scrapes? Works wonders, it does.",
  "AdultMaleD_10710": "Times used to be so much simpler, didn't they? There's so much to worry about now. I miss those days.",

  "AesopSharp_10617": "Wiggenweld Potion is not a cure-all. And no salve is a substitute for common sense.",
  "AesopSharp_10618": "The art of potion-making is delicate, and, as such, requires great precision.",
  "AesopSharp_10620": "You should be brewing a second potion by now.",
  "AesopSharp_10623": "Finish your potion, and then return to me.",
  "AesopSharp_10627": "It can heal some injuries, but not all. Points for Ravenclaw.",
  "AesopSharp_10629": "Before today’s class is completed, each of you will have brewed a Wiggenweld Potion of your own.",
  "AesopSharp_10636": "Use a strong even motion when crushing your ingredients.",
  "AesopSharp_10637": "Please be meticulous when adding powder to your potions. One errant sneeze could be disastrous.",
  "AesopSharp_10638": "One miscalculated drop is the difference between a potion and a poison.",
  "AesopSharp_10639": "I see most of you have not forgotten how to stir.",
  "AesopSharp_10640": "Not a bad first attempt. I’d suggest you try again.",
  "AesopSharp_10641": "You will begin this term by brewing a Wiggenweld Potion.",
  "AesopSharp_10642": "Mister Thakkar. Can you tell us why this particular potion might come in handy?",
  "AesopSharp_10644": "You never know when you might need it. Please begin.",
  "AesopSharp_10645": "You've done well today.",
  "AesopSharp_10647": "I confess I was sceptical, given the advanced nature of this class, and the fact you're a new student.",
  "AesopSharp_10648": "Now, I recommend that you find a safe location in which to practise brewing. You cannot leave a hot cauldron simply anywhere.",
  "AesopSharp_10662": "That will be all.",
  "AesopSharp_10664": "You'll find the ingredients you require on the cart in my office.",
  "AesopSharp_10668": "<i>Expulso!</i>",
  "AesopSharp_10670": "A rare occurrence. And you'd do well to remember that you're not a Potions master quite yet.",
  "AesopSharp_10675": "Rather poorly, I'd say.",
  "AesopSharp_10676": "We're raising a generation of coddled capeflappers that can scarcely tell the difference between Aconite and Asphodel.",
  "AesopSharp_10677": "You say that every year, Matilda.",
  "AesopSharp_10685": "Well, well. I trust you were meticulous in your efforts? After all, shortcuts only ever lead to shortcomings.",
  "AesopSharp_10719": "Professor. I was hoping to catch you. I – ",
  "AesopSharp_10720": "Probably best not to discuss it here, sir.",
  "AesopSharp_10721": "Of course, sir. Only – you'd asked me about a particular potion and I – well, I –",
  "AesopSharp_10733": "Professor Weasley's asked that I give you some assignments to hasten your education. Nothing more to it really.",
  "AesopSharp_10734": "Once they're completed, return to me and I shall know that you're ready to learn <i>Diffindo</i>.",
  "AesopSharp_10763": "For one, it could save your life. In fact, when my partner and I found ourselves tied up like Christmas hams and left out for the Horntails, it actually did.",
  "AesopSharp_10765": "For a number of reasons, you ought to know it.",
  "AesopSharp_10766": "A spell, like a blade, is only dangerous in the wrong hands. So it is imperative that the right hands learn to wield it too, and hone its edge.",
  "AesopSharp_10767": "And whilst you're keen, you'd do well to focus on honing your skills a bit more with these tasks before learning <i>Diffindo</i>. Once you've finished, report back to me.",
  "AesopSharp_10768": "Good. Ordinarily I'd say it's not my concern either way. But, you – I  want to make sure you're well-prepared.",
  "AesopSharp_10770": "Talent and resolve are a potent combination. It would be a shame to let that go to waste.",
  "AesopSharp_10800": "You should have collected the ingredients from my office and begun brewing a potion at your cauldron.",
  "AesopSharp_10805": "– but in the future you'll be expected to provide your own ingredients.",
  "AesopSharp_10808": "Come and see me when you've finished brewing, and we'll see if it was skill or luck the first time round.",
  "AesopSharp_10811": "Professor. A moment of your time, please.",
  "AesopSharp_10812": "Do you have a moment, Professor?",
  "AesopSharp_10817": "I think each of us has had enough excitement for one day. Class is dismissed.",
  "AesopSharp_10923": "Shameful. Go back to your dorm and change into your school robes. Immediately.",
  "AesopSharp_10931": "I hope you know better than to let Professor Fig take you on one of his foolhardy adventures.",
  "AesopSharp_10932": "I'm very sorry to hear of Professor Fig's passing.",
  "AesopSharp_10933": "Goblins – tunnelling beneath us? We have failed in our duty to protect the school.",
  "AesopSharp_10935": "I hope the Ministry sees to it that there are repercussions for any goblins that took part in the attack.",
  "AesopSharp_10944": "Now to determine which student gets this rather unenviable task.",
  "AesopSharp_10946": "You 'suppose' correctly.",
  "AesopSharp_10949": "Don't let it go to your head.",
  "AesopSharp_10953": "Yes, the Severing Charm – <i>Diffindo</i>. Useful in potion-making, and innocent enough when mincing daisy roots or slicing caterpillars.",
  "AesopSharp_10964": "What now Mr Weasley?",
  "AesopSharp_10970": "Good. You should be ready to learn <i>Depulso</i>. Let's see what you can do.",
  "AesopSharp_10971": "Not bad. Not bad at all.",
  "AesopSharp_10986": "I'm surprised you had the time. You seemed rather busy helping Mr Weasley brew chaos.",
  "AesopSharp_10988": "Taking responsibility for one's actions does go a long way with me. I shall assume that you've learnt a lesson.",
  "AesopSharp_11021": "Now, let's see how you fare with <i>Diffindo</i>. Wand at the ready.",
  "AesopSharp_11022": "Complete the tasks I've given you, and then meet me in my classroom to learn <i>Diffindo</i>, the Severing Charm. It's typically used to cut an object, but can be a powerful weapon when needed.",
  "AesopSharp_11023": "Hmm, very good.",
  "AesopSharp_11024": "I would encourage you, once again, to practise here in the classroom. For your sake – and that of everyone else.",
  "AesopSharp_11025": "It's a pleasure to have a student who actually heeds instruction.",
  "AesopSharp_11030": "You cannot be serious. Goblins working with Rookwood? Makes no sense.",
  "AesopSharp_11031": "Unorthodox? It's inconceivable. It's –",
  "AesopSharp_11032": "Hmmph.",
  "AesopSharp_11033": "Glad you managed to stay on task. Not every class is so eventful.",
  "AesopSharp_11037": "Hmm.  Not an easy potion to brew. Well done.",
  "AesopSharp_11038": "I'd advise doing more than the bare minimum if you want to hone your skills as quickly as possible.",
  "AesopSharp_11046": "Professor Weasley has asked that we all 'contribute extra time' to help you catch up to your peers.",
  "AesopSharp_11047": "And before I teach you <i>Depulso</i>, I must know that you are prepared to handle it.",
  "AesopSharp_11054": "You need to learn <i>Depulso</i>, the Banishing Charm. Useful for pushing objects, or adversaries, away. Complete the required tasks and meet me in my classroom.",
  "AesopSharp_11055": "– ah, Fig. You have a visitor.",
  "AesopSharp_11056": "I'll see what I can find out.",
  "AesopSharp_11058": "If you'd like to practise – and I think you should – perhaps best not to go flinging your classmates about the halls.",
  "AesopSharp_11059": "Well done. I'm glad to see that you seem staunchly determined to master your spell-casting.",
  "AesopSharp_11074": "Remember, precision is key when brewing potions.",
  "AesopSharp_11075": "A well-prepared witch or wizard always has a few potions on hand.",
  "AesopSharp_11076": "Keep your potions stations organised and free of clutter.",
  "AesopSharp_11077": "Your potion should not be that colour, Miss McDowell.",
  "AesopSharp_11078": "That's all for today.",
  "AesopSharp_11080": "That's enough for today. You're all dismissed.",
  "AesopSharp_11081": "Back for another assignment?",
  "AesopSharp_11085": "And you can keep that Fwooper feather. This time.",
  "AesopSharp_11086": "Mr Weasley did not do this on his own. His accomplice will answer to me as well.",
  "AesopSharp_11087": "That will be all.",
  "AesopSharp_11095": "And from what I hear of your recent exploits in Hogsmeade, you'd also do well to practise brewing the defensive Edurus potion.",
  "AesopSharp_11096": "Good. For the moment you can find the ingredients you need in my office –",
  "AesopSharp_11097": "Professor Weasley had you acquire the recipe from J. Pippin's, correct?",
  "AesopSharp_11098": "That'll be points from Gryffindor – again.",
  "AesopSharp_11101": "Should you chop the dittany or crush it? The wrong answer could result in the unfortunate loss of your eyebrows.",
  "AesopSharp_11102": "Proficiency and potions are two things that cannot be rushed. Have patience and be thorough.",
  "AesopSharp_11104": "You will not earn favour with me by failing to take responsibility for your actions. I suggest you heed my warning.",
  "AesopSharp_11105": "As for the work you did today at your own cauldron, I will say, you've done well.",
  "AesopSharp_11106": "Good luck with your assignments.",
  "AesopSharp_11107": "Have you finished your assignments?",
  "AesopSharp_11109": "How are your assignments coming along?",
  "AesopSharp_11110": "I saw Mr Weasley speaking with you earlier. He can be quite persuasive. Glad you managed to resist.",
  "AesopSharp_11111": "In addition to having a solid grasp of how to combine various ingredients, you should gain an understanding of the ingredients themselves.",
  "AesopSharp_11112": "Pay particular attention in Herbology. The plants you nurture there are often essential to the potions you brew here.",
  "AesopSharp_11113": "It seems you have a grasp on <i>Diffindo</i>.",
  "AesopSharp_11114": "Focus. <i>Diffindo</i> can be dangerous if you're not paying attention.",
  "AesopSharp_11115": "You've got it now.",
  "AesopSharp_11116": "Concentrate. Do not let your mind wander.",
  "AesopSharp_11122": "I can assure you, however, that as an Auror I saw it used in manners I dare not mention.",
  "AesopSharp_11128": "Still at it, I see. Well, repetition can be an excellent teacher.",
  "AesopSharp_11129": "As I mentioned earlier, <i>Diffindo</i> can be versatile, but dangerous. Good to see you continuing to practise.",
  "AesopSharp_11132": "Very well. I've brewed the Cure for Boils you wanted. I can drop it by your office when it's convenient.",
  "AesopSharp_11133": "A student. Very well, sir. If you insist.",
  "AesopSharp_11134": "Now, Professor Fig, aren't you going to leave some for the rest of us?",
  "AesopSharp_11135": "I suggest having a go at the enchanted books here.",
  "AesopSharp_11136": "Professor Fig should keep a better eye on you.",
  "AesopSharp_11137": "The impudence!",
  "AesopSharp_11138": "That had better not be a student I hear lurking about.",
  "AesopSharp_11139": "Students have no business in the Faculty Tower.",
  "AesopSharp_11140": "No pupils. Good. Where they find time to wander when they should be studying is beyond me.",
  "AesopSharp_11141": "Happily, I need not encounter a pupil right now. I've had my limit for today.",
  "AesopSharp_11148": "Some can be harvested from the plants you grow in your Herbology class and rarer ones can be purchased.",
  "AesopSharp_11149": "Others, however, may be harder to obtain and will require you to be a bit more – resourceful.",
  "AesopSharp_11151": "Observant.  I suppose I could indulge you for a moment.",
  "AesopSharp_11152": "Often, yes. Though I've seen some remarkably 'creative' concoctions brewed in my class.",
  "AesopSharp_11153": "Exhilarating? It was at that.  While it lasted, at any rate.",
  "AesopSharp_11154": "I enjoyed a great deal of success as an Auror.",
  "AesopSharp_11155": "However, success can make one complacent if one's confidence is not tempered by humility. One overstep in battle changed everything.",
  "AesopSharp_11156": "Hm? Yes, well, I suppose it's a matter of record. My partner and I had tracked a suspect to a harbour in Scarborough. Trying to smuggle shrunken heads of all things.",
  "AesopSharp_11157": "From the moment we stepped onto the ship, well – I barely escaped with my life. My partner wasn't so lucky.",
  "AesopSharp_11158": "It is at that. But survival is not guaranteed for any of us.",
  "AesopSharp_11160": "Pay attention – and not just within my class. This is what I must impress upon you all.",
  "AesopSharp_11161": "I had deduced that he was working alone. I was mistaken – and they knew we were coming.",
  "AesopSharp_11162": "A potion and a poison may be a mere breath apart – until you consume the wrong one.",
  "AesopSharp_11163": "Perhaps you haven't heard the myriad rumours they think I don't hear.",
  "AesopSharp_11164": "I am, in fact, an expert in potions. However, my interest was not the reason I came to Hogwarts.",
  "AesopSharp_11167": "I would still be an Auror today if my injury hadn't precluded it. The Ministry was all too ready to keep me on.",
  "AesopSharp_11168": "Buried under parchment, of course, helping run the Auror Recruitment Programme. But, if I'm meant for a life confined to a desk, well –",
  "AesopSharp_11169": "I might as well share my expertise, while searching for a way to heal my blasted leg. And the Hogwarts library is not to be underestimated.",
  "AesopSharp_11170": "As I said.",
  "AesopSharp_11171": "Lest you think for a moment that fear played any role in my departure, allow me to enlighten you.",
  "AesopSharp_11172": "Yes, well, I'm certain you have an empty cauldron waiting for you somewhere.",
  "AesopSharp_11175": "You must stir your cauldron in the correct direction.",
  "AesopSharp_11177": "Depends on how you intend to use it.",
  "AesopSharp_11178": "You do realise I have classes to teach. Very well, how may I assist you?",
  "AesopSharp_11179": "This ought to make quick work of you.",
  "AesopSharp_11180": "I've fought worse.",
  "AesopSharp_11181": "You think you're any match for Hogwarts' best and brightest?",
  "AesopSharp_11183": "It was not fear, but fate, that steered my hand.",
  "AesopSharp_11184": "Fate is what one makes of it. It may determine a path, but not one's choice in how to travel it.",
  "AesopSharp_11185": "Well said. However, it's worth noting that fear can be a great motivator in that one must conquer it.",
  "AesopSharp_11186": "Spent years tracking down reprobates who dealt in artefacts of Dark Magic origin.",
  "AesopSharp_11188": "They never go down easy, do they?",
  "AesopSharp_11189": "Hmph. Suit yourself.",
  "AesopSharp_11190": "Hmph. Suit yourself.",
  "AesopSharp_11191": "Did you misplace your robes?",
  "AesopSharp_11192": "Professor Fig was a man of conviction. He will be missed.",
  "AesopSharp_11193": "The Ministry needs to send Aurors out to Hogsmeade immediately.",
  "AesopSharp_11194": "I never thought Ranrok would be so bold as to attack Hogwarts.",
  "AesopSharp_11195": "You've come a long way with your education this year. You should be proud.",
  "AesopSharp_11196": "You and Miss Onai must be getting up to all sorts of adventures.",
  "AesopSharp_11197": "Perhaps Miss Sweeting can have a positive influence on you.",
  "AesopSharp_11198": "I hope you and Mr Sallow are staying out of trouble.",
  "AesopSharp_11199": "You've been spending a lot of time with Mr Thakkar. I hope he's helping you with Potions.",
  "AesopSharp_11200": "All the time you spend with Miss Reyes, perhaps she'll inspire a sense of competition in you. Might do you good.",
  "AesopSharp_11201": "I hope you won't let Mr Clopton's penchant for mischief influence you.",
  "AesopSharp_11203": "I suggest you give your wand a rest. And don't let me find you doing that again.",
  "AesopSharp_11205": "Who knows what would've happened to the school had it not been for you. We owe you our gratitude. All of us.",
  "AesopSharp_11206": "This is hardly the place.",
  "AesopSharp_11207": "Hmph.",
  "AgabusPhilbert_10116": "Before my extraordinary wife, Dulcibella, passed away, she had just completed a small book of poetry.",
  "AgabusPhilbert_10117": "As a surprise for her birthday – one she never had the chance to celebrate – I'd had the book beautifully bound and plated in gold.",
  "AgabusPhilbert_10127": "What? But – how did you – ? Thank you! I can't tell you what this means to me.",
  "AgabusPhilbert_10140": "I was shaken to my core. Still am, to be honest.",
  "AgabusPhilbert_10147": "Oh, my. I cannot believe I have this bit of my dearest Dulcibella back. Thank you, my young friend. Thank you.",
  "AgabusPhilbert_10165": "I watched helplessly, lying there in my entranceway, as he walked away with the book – laughing as he went.",
  "AgabusPhilbert_10168": "One day, Harlow came calling – to punish me for having spoken out against the Neanderthals that comprise Rookwood's lot.",
  "AgabusPhilbert_10170": "Hello there.",
  "AgabusPhilbert_10173": "Tragic what happened to Bickle. He wanted me to speak out against Harlow for an act of violence committed against me.",
  "AgabusPhilbert_10174": "But I feared Harlow's retaliation – and so I refused.",
  "AgabusPhilbert_10175": "Before I knew it, I'd been Petrified, and Harlow was rifling through my home. He found the book of poetry, with its exquisite gold-plating.",
  "AgabusPhilbert_10176": "(sigh) I suppose I have no choice. This extortion can't go on forever. You can pass it on to anyone who may be willing to help.",
  "AgabusPhilbert_10177": "Harlow does not like people talking – as you already know.",
  "AgabusPhilbert_10178": "Unfortunately, I suspect you're right.",
  "AgabusPhilbert_10179": "Perhaps. But – perhaps I would have suffered a similar fate.",
  "AgabusPhilbert_10180": "Of course. If it will help.",
  "AgabusPhilbert_10181": "I've learnt a lesson, indeed, about dealing with those sorts of monsters. Best not to upset them, isn't it?",
  "AgnesCoffey_10001": "Indeed. I have several moments at your disposal. And please, darling, call me Agnes!",
  "AgnesCoffey_10002": "Well – people are always whispering about that old, abandoned manor across the way.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10005": "I am! I settled into this little business after my  scandalous youth in Paris. The stories I could tell!",
  "AgnesCoffey_10006": "I'm in the garment trade. You won't find a finer selection of magical attire this side of the forest gate.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10008": "Can't quite compete with darling Augustus Hill at Gladrags, but who wants to make the trip all the way to Hogsmeade?",
  "AgnesCoffey_10009": "Hello there, my lovely! What can I do for you?",
  "AgnesCoffey_10010": "I'm simply beside myself since Rococo ran away. He's my pet Niffler.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10011": "Thank you. I appreciate your words. I've had him for years. He's lovely company.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10012": "He may be 'only a Niffler' to some, but to me he's a very special boy. Lovely company. I've had him for years.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10013": "Whilst on our morning constitutional the other day, south of here, he and I stumbled upon 'Henrietta's Hideaway'.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10014": "As we drew near, the morning sun reflected off something in a window – and before I knew it, Rococo was off!",
  "AgnesCoffey_10018": "Oh, that's terribly kind. But stay away from the Hideaway. Far too dangerous.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10021": "My Niffler, Rococo ran off to Henrietta's Hideaway. I'm hoping you'll keep an eye out for him.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10025": "– suspicion and isolation. The more wealth she amassed, the more paranoid she became of losing it.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10027": "I've been worried sick – but I'm not about to meddle with Merlin-knows-what's inside that house, or the Ashwinders that are lurking about!",
  "AgnesCoffey_10028": "Henrietta's Hideaway is treacherous enough, but add Ashwinders into the picture and well –",
  "AgnesCoffey_10029": "Oh, my poor boy.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10030": "How is my sweet Rococo? May I have him back?",
  "AgnesCoffey_10032": "Oh, my brave little explorer! My greedy, greedy boy!",
  "AgnesCoffey_10037": "I can't wait to get him home. Thank you, again, for what you did.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10038": "Oh, of course. I didn't realise you'd done all that. That was a lot of work. Anything for my precious baby.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10039": "If someone does find him in the Hideaway, they shall be well rewarded. Henrietta's treasures are theirs for the taking. She certainly won't mind now.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10040": "He will.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10041": "What? He's mine. I should have faced my fears and gone after him myself.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10042": "From now on I'll keep Rococo on a lead whenever we go out.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10043": "I – I can't believe I let this happen. Just take care of him. He'll never love anyone else. Never.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10044": "May you never have a moment's peace with him.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10045": "They say that Henrietta was a paranoid recluse. Filled her castle with all manner of traps to keep thieves from pinching her valuables.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10046": "What if he's lonely?",
  "AgnesCoffey_10047": "I do hope he hasn't been kidnapped or eaten.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10048": "That naughty boy, runs after anything shiny and new, he does.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10049": "Oh, goodness! Really? Thank you! You're very brave. I was at my wits' end.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10050": "Modelling in Place Cachée, stealing a ride on a flying carriage, getting stranded in the Pyrenees –",
  "AgnesCoffey_10051": "Some say it's cursed, or haunted. Some swear they've seen an eerie fog through the windows.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10052": "Hence the terrifying traps throughout the 'hideaway.' Not even her family has been willing to deal with them to get to her fortune.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10053": "I love Rococo, but I love staying alive more.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10054": "I've heard strange sounds there at night. Some Dark Magic in that house, if you ask me.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10058": "Henrietta was a baroness who married well. More than a few times. Her immense wealth drove her to a life of –",
  "AgnesCoffey_10059": "Oh, but I can't share all my secrets!",
  "AgnesCoffey_10060": "My poor Rococo!",
  "AgnesCoffey_10061": "Oh, thank you. You had me worried. I don't know what I'd do without my little scavenger.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10062": "Rococo's saviour! It's good to see you again.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10063": "How dare you come near me! I hope my darling Niffler Rococo hasn't given you a moment's peace since you stole him.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10064": "I shan't sell to you. Ever!",
  "AgnesCoffey_10065": "Oh, very fashionable.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10066": "Oh, you must never use that spell.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10068": "That wasn't intentional, was it?",
  "AgnesCoffey_10069": "Hello! Come to have a peruse of the wares?",
  "AgnesCoffey_10070": "A fine choice. You won't regret it.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10071": "Can never have enough stock; that's what I say.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10072": "Oh, dear. It appears you'd need more money for that.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10073": "Oh, that does suit you. And I've an eye for that sort of thing.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10074": "Thank you for stopping by.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10075": "What's brought you here today?",
  "AgnesCoffey_10076": "Oh! My fault.",
  "AgnesCoffey_10077": "Took care of that, didn't you?",
  "AgnesCoffey_10078": "Indeed. I have several moments at your disposal.",
  "AgnesScriven_10261": "Goodness gracious. What a mess.",
  "AgnesScriven_10263": "(tutting)",
  "AgnesScriven_10264": "Peeves, if you’re responsible for this mess it'll be the last straw.",
  "AgnesScriven_10265": "Is someone there? Is that you, Peeves?",
  "AgnesScriven_10266": "I shall go to the Headmaster this time. You have my word on that.",
  "AgnesScriven_10267": "My poor filing system – ruined.",
  "AgnesScriven_10268": "Bent spines, crumpled pages – deary me.",
  "AgnesScriven_10269": "(sighing)",
  "AgnesScriven_10270": "Not another one.",
  "AgnesScriven_10271": "Sneaking in the Restricted Section – again!",
  "AgnesScriven_10272": "I had thought we were through with this mischief. Clearly detentions are insufficient.",
  "AgnesScriven_10275": "That being said, Peeves informs me that you didn't come alone tonight.",
  "AgnesScriven_10276": "If someone has coerced you, I would have you tell me.",
  "AgnesScriven_10277": "You're a bright boy. Don't waste this.",
  "AgnesScriven_10279": "Oh, Sebastian. What will your uncle say?",
  "AgnesScriven_10285": "I'm afraid I must take this to the headmaster.",
  "AgnesScriven_10286": "There you are! Sneaking past me –",
  "AgnesScriven_10287": "– and taking dangerous books!",
  "AgnesScriven_10288": "Enough!",
  "AgnesScriven_10289": "Here!  Perhaps you'll find sweeping the courtyard more - productive.",
  "AgnesScriven_10290": "That - is what I said.  And let this be a lesson to all of you.  Off limits means off-limits. Hmph!",
  "AgnesScriven_10291": "Is someone there? The library's closed until morning.",
  "AgnesScriven_10292": "Better not be a student in here. It's after hours.",
  "AgnesScriven_10293": "I knew I heard someone. Out with you.",
  "AgnesScriven_10294": "The library is no place for larking about. Out. At once.",
  "AgnesScriven_10295": "Hmm. Must've been one of the books wandering about.",
  "AgnesScriven_10296": "I do hope Peeves isn't up to his ridiculous antics again.",
  "AgnesScriven_10297": "Peace and quiet at last.",
  "AgnesScriven_10298": "Now where did I put today's copy of the <i>Daily Prophet</i>?",
  "AgnesScriven_10299": "Must be more firm on late check-ins. This is a library, not a book shop.",
  "AgnesScriven_10300": "Someone must have been up late studying. I hope.",
  "AgnesScriven_10301": "Difficult to carry on without Professor Fig. But carry on we must.",
  "AgnesScriven_10302": "Perhaps if young people wouldn't get up to such antics in Hogsmeade, it wouldn't encourage these deviant trolls.",
  "AgnesScriven_10303": "Merely thinking of how Ranrok's Loyalists despoiled our school – it makes my blood boil.",
  "AgnesScriven_10304": "What a dreadful spell to cast.",
  "AgnesScriven_10305": "If only we had a lock-breaking section.",
  "AgnesScriven_10307": "This is a library, not a duelling mound!",
  "AgnesScriven_10308": "Reading can be as magical as any spell. Why can't students see that?",
  "AgnesScriven_10309": "Do you mind?",
  "AlbieWeekes_10001": "Ah, you're back. With something to report, I hope.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10002": "Incredible. Miss Reyes must have been shocked. Tell me – how was the broom?",
  "AlbieWeekes_10003": "Excellent choice for your very first broom!",
  "AlbieWeekes_10004": "Welcome back. I've arranged a special price on the broom upgrade for you. I truly appreciate all of  your help.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10005": "Back from your latest flight? I want to hear all the particulars.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10006": "Ah! Yes! Hmm, I see. I think I know how to address that. Thank you. I owe you one.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10008": "Shop's been closed since trade routes were disrupted. Had to travel as far as London to meet with my supplier –",
  "AlbieWeekes_10009": "Yew Weavers are rare because some fear flying them; likely to do with the Yew wand's darker reputation.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10014": "Then you have the Ember Dash, known for its handsome appearance.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10015": "Working with brooms every day, makes me practically giddy. It's one of many reasons I cherish running this shop.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10020": "Albie Weekes, at your service. Welcome to Spintwitches. Apologies if you came by before and weren't able to come in.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10027": "And I find a certain satisfaction in winning over the naysayers who think I may be too young to run this shop.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10028": "Thank you – it'll be worth your while. If I'm right, the new upgrade ought to enhance brooms in every regard and I can give you a special price.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10029": "I need a flyer with no bad habits and a knack for flying. Your classmate Everett said you're a natural on a broom.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10031": "The time trials should be a bit of fun too. Go to the Quidditch pitch and Imelda Reyes will sort you out.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10033": "I'm working on a broom upgrade and need someone to conduct a flight and report back to me on the experience.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10035": "I have a very good feeling about this upgrade. I guarantee you'll be pleased. Expect to hear from me soon.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10036": "I have a friend in Rome, runs a shop like mine; says it's worse there. 'Course, they do nap in the afternoons from what I hear.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10039": "Hmm, how to address the issue of altitude as it relates to speed?",
  "AlbieWeekes_10040": "Once you've beaten Imelda's time, be sure to let me know.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10041": "Hello again. I have spectacular news: the broom upgrade is ready! Stop by the shop when you can.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10042": "Report back as soon as you can, and we'll be off to the races!",
  "AlbieWeekes_10043": "Thank you again, truly.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10044": "I have thrilling news. I believe my next broom upgrade to be even more impressive than the last. Come by Spintwitches as soon as you can.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10045": "– I could complete work on my first upgrade. What say?",
  "AlbieWeekes_10046": "Ooh, thank you. Hmm. That's precisely what I needed to know.  Drifted, eh. I shall get to work immediately.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10053": "You sound as determined as I am to improve broom flight! It's a joy to have a collaborator like yourself.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10055": "Brilliant – I knew the upgrade had fantastic potential. How did your broom feel?",
  "AlbieWeekes_10069": "I'm truly awed by what we've accomplished. The final broom upgrade is better than even I expected. Stop by Spintwitches when you can.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10071": "You know me well. I feel I'm almost there. I just think I can improve broom flight a bit more.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10073": "I look forward to our next meeting.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10074": "How's my favourite test flyer?",
  "AlbieWeekes_10075": "Couldn't have done this without you.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10076": "Fantastic! Your broom performed well then?",
  "AlbieWeekes_10079": "Miss Reyes is running a time trial at the south coast course. Not ideal really, what with rumours of Ranrok's lot and Ashwinders infiltrating the place.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10080": "I hope you are able to complete these trials. I have a feeling this final upgrade is going to be a sweeping success.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10081": "Do be careful, of course. I shall look forward to hearing from you soon.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10083": "Of course! Should have anticipated that. Exactly the kind of report I've come to expect from you.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10084": "At last, I think I know what needs to be done for my final upgrade.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10088": "I hope that won't deter you, and you'll give the course a go. At least think on it!",
  "AlbieWeekes_10089": "I'll be sure to send you an owl when I'm finished. Thank you again for your help.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10090": "However, if you're flying high above them, you should be all right. I think.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10096": "If you could beat Imelda's fastest time in the broom trials she's running, you might be able to provide me with just what I need.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10099": "You seem to be a flyer who might be interested in, say, some enhancements.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10101": "I have some ideas for enchantments – 'upgrades', if you will – that will improve the performance of any broom you fly.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10102": "Since the moment I saw my first Quidditch match. Seeing flyers manoeuvre the way they do –",
  "AlbieWeekes_10104": "Some people continue to have their doubts about me and my ideas –",
  "AlbieWeekes_10113": "Whilst nearly any broom will certainly be a step up from the practice brooms in Kogawa's class, they all have their – limitations.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10115": "I did. But my focus on the technical elements of brooms rather than the art of flying drove her mad.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10116": "With your help, I can continue proving myself the most knowledgeable purveyor of wizarding sporting goods around.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10117": "I hope that won't dissuade you from helping. I know I'm onto something.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10118": "If your rumoured talent for flying can help you beat Imelda's times, then having you assess the broom will be invaluable.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10119": "Oh, you'd be surprised. People get set in their ways. Worry that fiddling with what's working fine will somehow ruin it. (sigh)",
  "AlbieWeekes_10120": "Even the naysayers will be forced to admit that my work's had potential all along.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10121": "I wondered if you might be interested in putting your broom to the test in the time trial near Irondale.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10122": "The course is more challenging than the Quidditch pitch course. I recall this one as a favourite of Miss Reyes.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10123": "Some of your classmates mentioned they were headed there, eager to see what Imelda has in store.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10125": "Once you've finished, I'd be much obliged if you'd report back as to how the broom fared.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10127": "Wonderful. I know you'll be pleased with the upgrade.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10128": "Can't wait to hear from you soon.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10129": "If you were to test this first upgrade there, it may help me as I develop the next. You'll consider it, won't you?",
  "AlbieWeekes_10131": "Without the information you provided, my work would've taken twice as long. Thank you, again.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10133": "Thank you. I know this recent success was only the beginning of what I can do for broom flight.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10134": "A bit surprising, considering many of them expressed reticence at the idea of racing against her at all.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10138": "Those people don't appreciate the sense of freedom that comes with quality broom flight. Nor do they appreciate all that's involved in the creative process.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10139": "I wondered – would you be interested in joining forces again? There's another course near Irondale that Miss Reyes has mastered.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10140": "It may sound ambitious but I've already begun work on another upgrade. More difficult to perfect than the last.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10141": "I must tell you – half of Hogsmeade's been by the shop asking about rumours of a broom upgrade.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10142": "You'll get a special price. This upgrade'll be well worth it.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10143": "You should enjoy this upgrade. I've arranged an especially low price for you.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10145": "It's just a jaunt from here, south of Hogsmeade, beautiful mountain views. The course was designed to test flyer stamina.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10146": "If I'm right, and I do hope I am, you'll be hearing good news from me soon.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10147": "I do. You've done so much already, I hate to ask for more. But if you could best Miss Reyes's time on the south coast course –",
  "AlbieWeekes_10148": "– that would provide me with precisely the information about the broom flight I need.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10151": "You're all set with the new upgrade. I can't wait to hear what you think.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10152": "Hello again. Wonderful to see you. As before, I've arranged a special price on the broom upgrade for you.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10154": "A further upgrade – can you believe it? I've arranged a special price for you.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10155": "The upgrade is ready for you – and at a special price.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10156": "This may sound presumptuous, but – ",
  "AlbieWeekes_10160": "Brilliant. I hope this upgrade does wonders for you.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10161": "As it happens, another Hogwarts student, Imelda Reyes, is using abandoned broom courses for time trials. Clever girl.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10162": "I aim to make Spintwitches the most sought-after shop in Hogsmeade.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10164": "I truly enjoyed working with you. Thank you for believing in me.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10165": "And I wouldn't mind getting back on a broom myself. Just for the thrill of it.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10167": "Couldn't be more pleased we made headway with the upgrades – proved the naysayers wrong. Made all the hard work worth it.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10168": "An ideal situation for collecting flight statistics. If you were to compete for the best time and succeed, then report back to me with how your broom behaved –",
  "AlbieWeekes_10169": "He's forever in here studying the newest models. Almost as passionate about brooms as I am.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10170": "She thinks it fitting I run Spintwitches now. I don't reckon either of us ever pictured me batting away Bludgers for the Cannons or Puddlemere United.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10171": "Ha! Knew I was right about you. I think you'll be quite happy with the performance of any broom at lower altitudes.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10172": "But you may notice that speed consistency tends to falter as you rise. I believe I can remedy this issue.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10173": "What I need is someone to conduct a broom flight and report back to me so I can perfect the upgrades.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10174": "I did try to get Imelda to help, but she has some flying habits and quirks that made her – difficult to collaborate with.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10175": "And where would we be without enhancements? I mean, if Elliot Smethwyck had let the naysayers get to him, we would never have had the Cushioning Charm! I don't listen to them.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10176": "Oh, hello again! Couldn't have perfected the broom upgrades without your help. As always, I have a special price for you.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10177": "– and I've only just returned. Thankfully, with inventory. I presume you're in the market for a new broom?",
  "AlbieWeekes_10178": "Got a few rare Yew Weavers available, Ember Dash, Silver Arrows –",
  "AlbieWeekes_10179": "Wind Wisps too. No matter what broom you choose, you'll be pleased. They're all exceptional – both in quality and performance.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10180": "Terrible, it's been. Trade routes reported as unusable. Evidently, criminals are overtaking roads, threatening hamlets.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10181": "I can fly safely almost anywhere! – but you try flying with an inventory of brooms on your back. No easy feat.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10182": "Right, then! Back to work. If a particular broom takes your fancy, just let me know.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10183": "I've a passion for them! Every detail of every model. Take Wind Wisps; well known for their quality ash handles.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10184": "How – unconventional.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10185": "You're one of the students who sent Theophilus Harlow to Azkaban, aren't you? I can't thank you enough for that.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10186": "The Dark Arts? Brave, aren't we?",
  "AlbieWeekes_10188": "You'll need to be more careful than that.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10189": "Ah, a new face. Wonderful!",
  "AlbieWeekes_10190": "You're back! Nice to see you again.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10191": "You'll be thrilled with that broom. I promise you!",
  "AlbieWeekes_10192": "Nice doing business with you.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10193": "I'm afraid that costs a bit more than you have.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10194": "That item is of the highest quality.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10195": "Thanks for stopping by. Hope to see you again.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10196": "What are we looking for today?",
  "AlbieWeekes_10197": "Oh, sorry. Only me.",
  "AlbieWeekes_10198": "Well. Remind me not to cross your path.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10014": "What needs doing needs doing.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10016": "My troll? What? Oh, I don't know what to say! Thank you.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10017": "Be strong, Alexandra.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10018": "If the hamlet sent you here to talk to me about – about – I know what I have to do.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10019": "It's not every day a girl has to put down her own troll. I should be allowed to work up to it.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10021": "But everyone wants him gone. They think it's mad, my training a troll. Impossible even.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10024": "Surely you've seen the tapestry of him at Hogwarts. It hangs in the seventh-floor corridor.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10025": "I was hoping to train him to serve as protection for us.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10030": "Goodness. I am glad you're all right. You're very brave.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10031": "I know, I know. But I had to try. I suppose I understand why everyone has been so concerned.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10032": "Thank you. Thank you for saying that. I wish others felt the same. But, I suppose I understand why everyone has been so concerned.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10033": "But, he's my troll and my problem.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10034": "(sigh) What made me think I could train him? I should've learned from Barnabas the Barmy.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10035": "People in the hamlet had already crafted a moniker for whoever eventually defeated my – I mean that – troll. It was Troll something or other –",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10036": "Yes, that was it. I suppose it's your title now.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10037": "I need some time on my own. But, truly, thank you for what you did.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10038": "I – thought that's why you were here. I'm sorry –",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10039": " I suppose if you spend enough time with trolls you forget your manners. I'm Alexandra. Didn't mean to be short with you.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10040": "I apologised when he almost trampled half the hamlet yesterday. He just needs more time.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10041": "He allegedly tried to train trolls for the ballet. You can imagine how that turned out.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10042": "I wish things could have turned out differently for him.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10043": "Frankly, I struggled to teach him even a word or two. Couldn't give him even a semblance of self-control.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10044": "I'll be honest – I'm afraid I won't be able to take care of him. He's stronger than any troll I've ever encountered. I wish I knew someone else who could do it.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10045": "Oh, no. I didn't mean to suggest that you should do it.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10047": "The poor dear is out of control. He's an absolute menace to the hamlet.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10048": "What ho, Troll Vanquisher! Oh that does make me sad.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10049": "What ho, Troll Slayer! Oh, my poor troll.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10050": "I hope you avoided my troll!",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10051": "With Ranrok's lot seemingly everywhere, I thought the hamlet could use a bit more security. But my plan has gone awry.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10052": "In fact, you should avoid the area just southwest of here. At least until I work up the courage to do what needs to be done.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10053": "I do hope you're able to dispatch him. I cannot bring myself to do it.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10054": "It's the Troll Whisperer. Oh, why did I think I could train a troll?",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10055": "I wonder if one could teach a troll to ride a broom.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10056": "Impressive. I thought only  mountain trolls rode Graphorns.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10057": "Hippogriffs are rather fascinating. Not as fascinating as trolls though.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10058": "That’s a – brave choice of clothing.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10059": "I know trolls and they would never attack Hogsmeade like that.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10060": "What made Ranrok believe that he would ever prevail.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10061": "Troll Vanquisher!  I can't thank you enough for what you did.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10062": "Troll Slayer! I can't thank you enough for what you did.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10063": "No, no. Never use that spell.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10064": "No better way to open a lock, if you ask me.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10066": "Careful now, unless you're looking for a fight.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10067": "Troll Whisperer! I can't thank you enough for what you did.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10068": "Oh, pardon me.",
  "AlexandraRicketts_10069": "Dear me – all the restraint of a troll.",
  "AlfredLawley_10027": "What could be stirring in the cellar?",
  "AlfredLawley_10028": "Must have been the spiders.",
  "AlfredLawley_10029": "Stop! Plant bandit!",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10023": "Fascinating. Truly fascinating. Wish I had the energy.",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10024": "How I love a good puzzle.",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10025": "It must lead to something grand.",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10026": "(laughs) Yes, indeed. Talking to myself, again. I find myself to be quite the engaging conversationalist since my husband passed.",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10027": "Ah. Understood. However, you might feel otherwise when I tell you a bit more about the rumours surrounding this particular one.",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10028": "You see? I suspected you'd be interested. And wait till I tell you about the rumours surrounding this particular puzzle.",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10030": "Perhaps you could take a look? I'd be rather interested to hear what – if anything – you find.",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10031": "Ah, the spirit of youth. I do hope you'll be able to solve the puzzle. If not for me, then in Greville's memory.",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10032": "Well done. Oh, I miss having someone like you around – with a thirst for knowledge and a quick mind.",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10033": "Well, my curiosity has been satisfied. Thank you for that. Who knows what I'll encounter on my next constitutional?",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10036": "Madam Althea Twiddle. Pleased to meet you.",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10037": "You know, you might be interested in this. You young people love this sort of thing.",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10038": "My husband often ruminated on the mysterious statue just outside our hamlet. Some sort of archaic puzzle involving vases, he would insist.",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10039": "My husband Greville insisted that solving the puzzle would reveal a magical challenge of sorts.",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10040": "I stumbled upon it today when I had a burst of energy and extended my morning constitutional a bit longer than usual.",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10042": "My husband insisted that solving the puzzle surrounding that statue would result in some sort of magical challenge.",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10044": "Oh really? How exciting.",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10046": "Any luck with that puzzle?",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10047": "My husband would be so pleased to know he was right about that statue.",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10048": "I was hoping you'd try to solve it and let me know what you discover.",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10053": "It's not far from Irondale. It's down by the shore, near those old ruins. You can't miss it.",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10054": "The man was intrigued by everything.  He was about to try and solve it himself when – (sigh)",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10055": "Don't care for those, I see.",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10056": "Not too fast, now. Best to be cautious.",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10057": "Oh, dear. A Graphorn, of all things. Is that what the children are doing now?",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10058": "Oh, a Hippogriff. Haven't seen one of those for ages.",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10059": "My, my. Is that what the young folks are wearing now?",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10060": "Trolls attacking Hogsmeade? Never heard of such a thing. Not in all my years.",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10061": "Ranrok's Loyalists had become quite a danger, hadn't they? Quite a relief to know that's all in the past now.",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10062": "Truly a marvellous statue. Greville would have loved to see it in its current state.",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10063": "Oh, my. Careful now.",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10064": "Oh, dear. Pardon me.",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10065": "Oh, dear. Never ever use that sort of spell.",
  "AltheaTwiddle_10066": "Now, there's a spell I haven't considered using in some time.",
  "AmitKakkar_00003": "(angry roar)",

  "AmitKakkar_10001": "My parents considered keeping me home from school this year after the rumours of a goblin rebellion.",
  "AmitKakkar_10002": "Hmm, all out of dittany. After class, I must remember to collect the plants that I was growing in the greenhouse after class.",
  "AmitKakkar_10003": "It's always difficult to stay focused when my fellow students behave so childishly.",
  "AmitKakkar_10036": "Greetings to you, friend.",
  "AmitKakkar_10039": "Always a pleasure to see you.",
  "AmitKakkar_10041": "Hello.",
  "AmitKakkar_10042": "Hello there.",
  "AmitKakkar_10043": "Ah, hello.",
  "AmitKakkar_10044": "Greetings.",
  "AmitKakkar_10045": "Nice to see you.",
  "AmitKakkar_10078": "Can you not see that I'm superior to you?",
  "AmitKakkar_10079": "Oh, you're in for it now!",
  "AmitKakkar_10080": "This will not go well for you!",
  "AmitKakkar_10081": "Well, that was easier than expected.",
  "AmitKakkar_10082": "I'm getting better all the time.",
  "AmitKakkar_10083": "I may be the best wizard to have ever lived.",
  "AmitKakkar_10084": "Right – don't wish to be seen, do we?",
  "AmitKakkar_10085": "I'm quite good at sneaking about. You'll see.",
  "AmitKakkar_10108": "Looks like trouble ahead.",
  "AmitKakkar_10109": "Danger is afoot. Perhaps we ought to avoid it?",
  "AmitKakkar_10110": "Are you feeling all right? You don't look well.",
  "AmitKakkar_10111": "Don't give up. I can help you.",
  "AmitKakkar_10112": "That ought to do it. You'll feel better soon.",
  "AmitKakkar_10124": "This is an awful idea. We'll never survive.",
  "AmitKakkar_10125": "This may be the least intelligent thing I've ever done.",
  "AmitKakkar_10127": "Astounding! How have you accomplished that?",
  "AmitKakkar_10234": "Why would you do such a thing?",
  "AmitKakkar_10235": "You did it! With a bit of help from me, of course.",
  "AmitKakkar_10236": "I thought we were doomed for sure. This is a pleasant surprise.",
  "AmitKakkar_10242": "Don't do that. That's vandalism!",
  "AmitKakkar_10276": "A schematic. They're building something. I can't quite make it out. Curious.",
  "AmitKakkar_10277": "If I'm translating this correctly, and I think that I am, they're building something rather large, but what?",
  "AmitKakkar_10278": "Fascinating to see Gobbledegook written in a goblin hand. The flourishes are extraordinary.",
  "AmitKakkar_10279": "Another schematic. What are they going to build? This mine is too small for whatever it is.",
  "AmitKakkar_10298": "Here I can adjust that for y–",
  "AmitKakkar_10300": "Sir Affpuddle was the friendliest knight. Ergo, his statue must effect some salutary gesture when one draws near.",
  "AmitKakkar_10301": "When I do well in Herbology, I do well in Potions. Very efficacious.",
  "AmitKakkar_10310": "If Grimbald Weft is nearby, he'd be a perfect interview subject for a report on goblin rebellions.",
  "AmitKakkar_10311": "Ooooooo Baaagaaaaahhhh Leooo--!",
  "AmitKakkar_10312": "I, uh – well, yes. Perhaps my pronunciation was a bit off. I imagine certain dialects differ –",
  "AmitKakkar_10321": "Did I hear Professor Shah say that you don't have your own telescope? I have a spare one you could borrow for the rest of term.",
  "AmitKakkar_10325": "Let us get moving while the stars are still out. I'll show you how to use that telescope once we get there. I promise.",
  "AmitKakkar_10326": "I'm certain. It's my old one.",
  "AmitKakkar_10327": "No, really. You can. And I won't. It's my old one.",
  "AmitKakkar_10328": "I finally got my hands on the new Celestia Contemplor. You've heard of it, I assume? I mean, of course you have –",
  "AmitKakkar_10330": "Brilliant! You won't regret it.",
  "AmitKakkar_10344": "I would not offer a prospective stargazer a third-rate Lunascope.  But there is, um, something else.",
  "AmitKakkar_10345": "You remember those Astronomy Tables Shah was going on about? It just so happens I've been reading up on them a little myself.",
  "AmitKakkar_10347": "I do. Are you in?",
  "AmitKakkar_10348": "No, no. I certainly wasn't trying to – bribe you or anything. But – are you in?",
  "AmitKakkar_10349": "No one from the Gobstones Club will go with me. Said they'd rather get spit at by a stone than – well, they are cowards.",
  "AmitKakkar_10350": "And your contribution was invaluable. Rest assured, you shall be credited in my memoirs one day.",
  "AmitKakkar_10351": "And I look forward to writing them!",
  "AmitKakkar_10352": "Oh, you wait! You are going to be quoted saying just that.",
  "AmitKakkar_10353": "You are welcome. It has goblin-cut glass and a Gobbledegook inscription. I'm practically fluent in Gobbledegook, you know.",
  "AmitKakkar_10354": "The table is on a castle wall ahead. Look for a stone platform. Something that doesn't quite belong.",
  "AmitKakkar_10378": "Here I am, 'charging' ahead. Why don't you lead the way?",
  "AmitKakkar_10382": "Some say the locations of the tables were originally marked by centaurs for ritual stargazing.",
  "AmitKakkar_10384": "I think you should do the honours. Go on, try it out!",
  "AmitKakkar_10386": "Your goblin secrets are safe with me, but I get to write the book about this escapade some day.",
  "AmitKakkar_10387": "I wonder if Professor Binns knows anything about the history of Astronomy in Scotland.",
  "AmitKakkar_10397": "Understood. I'll leave you to it.",
  "AmitKakkar_10402": "Without further ado – adieu.",
  "AmitKakkar_10404": "Bound to be plans around here somewhere.",
  "AmitKakkar_10406": "I cannot believe I met a goblin.",
  "AmitKakkar_10408": "Shall we?",
  "AmitKakkar_10412": "I was right about the tables. They really are 'gateways to the far stars,' just as the book said!",
  "AmitKakkar_10413": "This is only the beginning! You will find more tables like this one throughout the grounds and forest – all beckoning to be discovered by a worthy astronomer.",
  "AmitKakkar_10425": "I have to admire your strategy. Well done.",
  "AmitKakkar_10437": "Ahem. Anyway, glad our adventure was a success! I will see you soon.",
  "AmitKakkar_10450": "And it seems there may be one right here at Hogwarts. I believe we could use it to find hidden constellations!",
  "AmitKakkar_10454": "I think the professor wants us to follow him.",
  "AmitKakkar_10456": "Greetings, Professor. I hope this day finds you well.",
  "AmitKakkar_10460": "Books so rarely prepare one for reality. A real goblin mine. It's even grander than I had expected!",
  "AmitKakkar_10461": "That switch should operate the lift.",
  "AmitKakkar_10462": "I still can't believe we're inside a real goblin mine.",
  "AmitKakkar_10463": "I've read about mines like this, but seeing one is something else altogether.",
  "AmitKakkar_10464": "I feel like a character from one of the adventure books I read during the summer holidays.",
  "AmitKakkar_10469": "I have some, uh, reading to finish on the lower deck. Come find me there afterwards – and bring the telescope. There's something I want to talk to you about.",
  "AmitKakkar_10470": "Think nothing of it. Anyway, the telescope's in the storage room right underneath us. You can't miss it.",
  "AmitKakkar_10471": "– it's only the pinnacle of all personal stargazing implements.  But my old model's not too shabby either:",
  "AmitKakkar_10484": "I hope we review dragon dung deliquescence points.",
  "AmitKakkar_10809": "I don't understand why everyone struggles with Potions. You simply need to follow the instructions.",
  "AmitKakkar_10819": "Well done!",
  "AmitKakkar_10820": "Goodness! That was incredible!",
  "AmitKakkar_10821": "Promise you will teach me some of those moves.",
  "AmitKakkar_10825": "I am not intimidated – mostly not intimidated.",
  "AmitKakkar_10826": "You will regret crossing me!",
  "AmitKakkar_10827": "You cannot defeat us!",
  "AmitKakkar_10828": "I know just the trick to take you down.",
  "AmitKakkar_10829": "I did it!",
  "AmitKakkar_10830": "I knew I had it in me.",
  "AmitKakkar_10831": "Ha!",
  "AmitKakkar_10835": "Yes, of course.",
  "AmitKakkar_10836": "I'll be quiet.",
  "AmitKakkar_10837": "Clever.",
  "AmitKakkar_10855": "Be careful up ahead.",
  "AmitKakkar_10856": "They look angry.",
  "AmitKakkar_10857": "Are you sure about this?",
  "AmitKakkar_10858": "Take something for your injuries.",
  "AmitKakkar_10859": "Are you all right?",
  "AmitKakkar_10860": "You can't leave me alone!",
  "AmitKakkar_10861": "Use a healing item before it's too late.",
  "AmitKakkar_10862": "That ought to help.",
  "AmitKakkar_10863": "Don't worry, I am here.",
  "AmitKakkar_10878": "Oh here we go.",
  "AmitKakkar_10879": "Don't be rash now.",
  "AmitKakkar_10880": "Stay sharp in there.",
  "AmitKakkar_10883": "You have certainly shown your skills!",
  "AmitKakkar_10884": "You need to teach me that!",
  "AmitKakkar_10885": "Where did you learn that?",
  "AmitKakkar_10902": "A forbidden curse? Why would you do such a thing?",
  "AmitKakkar_10903": "I have gravely misjudged you. This is – vile.",
  "AmitKakkar_10915": "Stop that. You are acting like a common criminal.",
  "AmitKakkar_10916": "What has got into you?",
  "AmitKakkar_10923": "What has got into you?",
  "AmitKakkar_10932": "Your first broom. I can't wait to see it in flight!",
  "AmitKakkar_10933": "That is a significant upgrade.",
  "AmitKakkar_10934": "A perfect chance to practice <i>Alohomora</i>.",
  "AmitKakkar_10935": "I bet this can be unlocked.",
  "AmitKakkar_10936": "Could you open this?",
  "AmitKakkar_10991": "We are not alone.",
  "AmitKakkar_10992": "I shall protect you the best that I can.",
  "AmitKakkar_10993": "I won't let any harm come to my friend.",
  "AmitKakkar_10994": "Oh goodness, they see us.",
  "AmitKakkar_10995": "Oh no. We've been spotted.",
  "AmitKakkar_10996": "Oh I didn't alert them.",
  "AmitKakkar_11010": "There. That will be better.",
  "AmitKakkar_11011": "I told you I would be helpful.",
  "AmitKakkar_11012": "I'm ready when you are.",
  "AmitKakkar_11013": " Oh dear.",
  "AmitKakkar_11014": "Just keep your wits about you, Amit.",
  "AmitKakkar_11053": "What is the plan?",
  "AmitKakkar_11054": "Think carefully before you act.",
  "AmitKakkar_11055": "Let's do it.",
  "AmitKakkar_11060": "Incredible!",
  "AmitKakkar_11061": "What an excellent broom!",
  "AmitKakkar_11063": "Look at the size of that Graphorn!",
  "AmitKakkar_11064": "You ride that Graphorn with such confidence!",
  "AmitKakkar_11065": "Goodness! Look at it go!",
  "AmitKakkar_11066": "I cannot wait to practise riding a Hippogriff of my own.",
  "AmitKakkar_11067": "You have saved Archie! What a hero!",
  "AmitKakkar_11068": "You did a great thing, saving those Hippogriffs.",
  "AmitKakkar_11069": "Isko owes you a debt a gratitude, that is for certain.",
  "AmitKakkar_11070": "You've done us all a great service. I'm so relieved to know that you took care of Rookwood.",
  "AmitKakkar_11072": "Sebastian is always testing the rules. It is no wonder he got detention.",
  "AmitKakkar_11073": "Poor Anne, being too injured to attend Hogwarts. If that were me, I don't know what I would do.",
  "AmitKakkar_11074": "I'm not sure what to make of Ominis Gaunt these days.",
  "AmitKakkar_11091": "Forgot to get dressed again? It happened to me once too.",
  "AmitKakkar_11092": "You have bested Imelda in the races. I didn't think anyone could beat her.",
  "AmitKakkar_11113": "I see that you and Professor Fig are close. You must be learning a lot from him.",
  "AmitKakkar_11114": "It is one of the hardest things to lose a teacher. Professor Fig was a brilliant man.",
  "AmitKakkar_11115": "I hope we did Lodgok proud. He never would have wanted this goblin rebellion to happen.",
  "AmitKakkar_11117": "I promise I will do everything I can to honour Lodgok's memory, and bring peace to the goblins.",
  "AmitKakkar_11138": "It will be! Trust me, I have read practically everything there is to read about this. It should be brilliant!",
  "AmitKakkar_11140": "If you fail History of Magic, you're doomed to repeat it. The class, that is.",
  "AmitKakkar_11141": "(cheers)",
  "AmitKakkar_11153": "The constellation should appear near the centre of your view.",
  "AmitKakkar_11154": "As soon as you've lined up the telescope, we will be able to fill out our star chart.",
  "AmitKakkar_11155": "That is it! Lupus! Incredible. Let us jot this down.",
  "AmitKakkar_11156": "Stargazing is all about patience and precision.",
  "AmitKakkar_11157": "I know it is nearly impossible to contain your excitement at a moment like this, but keep steady. Gentle adjustments.",
  "AmitKakkar_11161": "Just – thought you'd find that interesting.",
  "AmitKakkar_11165": "Speaking of stars, we'll be in Astronomy together. You'll love it. Professor Shah is firm, but quite clever. See you soon, no doubt.",
  "AmitKakkar_11168": "And if I have ever seen one, it's you. Oh, and about my old telescope – don't bother returning it. You should keep it.",
  "AmitKakkar_11169": "Look, there's the table!",
  "AmitKakkar_11173": "Hello again! Brilliant class, wasn't it? I prefer Astronomy over Potions, don't you?",
  "AmitKakkar_11174": "Oh – hello! I'm Amit. We met in Potions class. I'm happy to report that we've yet to have any explosions in this class.",
  "AmitKakkar_11175": "These machines operate on steam. Interesting.",
  "AmitKakkar_11177": "Poppy helping you out? She's brilliant with beasts. Pity she's not as good with people.",
  "AmitKakkar_11178": "The perfect night for – oh, hello again.",
  "AmitKakkar_11179": "Sitting in the storage room beneath the top deck. Look for the smaller set of stairs on the main observation deck.",
  "AmitKakkar_11187": "Of course! Hurry back once you have found it.",
  "AmitKakkar_11189": "I've read stories about this manor before – legends really. And dreadful ones at that.",
  "AmitKakkar_11190": "Brace yourself. I get the overwhelming sense that the worst is yet to come.",
  "AmitKakkar_11191": "Merlin's beard! Good conversation is the enemy of free time. I must return my book, Gateway to the Far Stars, before my next class.",
  "AmitKakkar_11192": "Oh. You're the new student! I've heard much about you. Um, thank you. I'm Amit, by the way. Pleasure. Truly.",
  "AmitKakkar_11193": "And I've never seen anyone brew such a flawless Wiggenweld Potion on their first try. Well done!",
  "AmitKakkar_11194": "A fascinating language by the way. Neither here nor there, really, but I am a self-taught speaker.",
  "AmitKakkar_11195": "Don't take it personally. Professor Sharp wouldn't be impressed by a troll reciting The Tales of Beedle the Bard backwards –",
  "AmitKakkar_11196": "You must simply have a knack for potion-making.",
  "AmitKakkar_11197": "Professor Sharp must have learnt a lot during his time as an Auror. I wish he talked about it more.",
  "AmitKakkar_11198": "Why, hello. Would you like to take a look?",
  "AmitKakkar_11199": "That's just brilliant, Amit. Brilliant. You'd think you could – ugh. That is not how that –",
  "AmitKakkar_11200": "I'm Amit. Pleasure to have you in Ravenclaw. Never met someone who's been so close to a dragon before.",
  "AmitKakkar_11225": "Oh yes.  So much to be learned from the stars. Also, there's something about the open air and night sky above the tower. It's invigorating.",
  "AmitKakkar_11232": "Yes. Oh, and speaking of class, better get to my first one of the year. Nothing like the smell of fresh parchment, is there?",
  "AmitKakkar_11237": "Can't see too much in the day – well, except for stars like Sirius, Canopus, Vega, and Arcturus.",
  "AmitKakkar_11238": "All right. Deep breath.",
  "AmitKakkar_11239": "You will adore Astronomy. Professor Shah is incredibly knowledgeable.",
  "AmitKakkar_11241": "Well, you should know that all fifth-years must take Astronomy. However, I think you will feel differently after one night up on the tower.",
  "AmitKakkar_11242": "I have good news for you: you are most definitely taking Astronomy. It is required for all fifth-years.",
  "AmitKakkar_11250": "And that is another potion mastered.",
  "AmitKakkar_11251": "A quality telescope can show you things you never dreamed of.",
  "AmitKakkar_11252": "You will be enthralled with the tower. Plus, a quality telescope can show you things you never dreamed of.",
  "AmitKakkar_11253": "Be seeing you!",
  "AmitKakkar_11254": "Garreth! Not again.",
  "AmitKakkar_11284": "It's not that creepy out here at night, is it? The Gobstones Club are cowards.",
  "AmitKakkar_11285": "More cobwebs. You don't think any spiders might be lurking about?",
  "AmitKakkar_11287": "It is nice having a fellow stargazer to explore with.",
  "AmitKakkar_11288": "Not many appreciate all there is to see outside the castle.",
  "AmitKakkar_11289": "Hmm. A little foreboding.",
  "AmitKakkar_11290": "Oh, thank you! That means a lot coming from a fellow Ravenclaw.",
  "AmitKakkar_11291": "Some students seem so confounded by potion recipes, it's as if they were written in Gobbledegook!",
  "AmitKakkar_11292": "– and in Gobbledegook!",
  "AmitKakkar_11298": "Hello! I don't believe we've met officially. I'm Amit. I'm something of an Astronomy buff.",
  "AmitKakkar_11299": "Oh – hello! Good to see you again. We Ravenclaws must stick together.",
  "AmitKakkar_11301": "I did! I mean, I do. Speak it. Is this to do with the goblin I saw you with in Hogsmeade?",
  "AmitKakkar_11303": "Of course. I just want to check the pronunciation of a couple of key terms first, so I will meet you there.",
  "AmitKakkar_11304": "I've been reading it for as long as I've been reading English. My parents have an extensive library.",
  "AmitKakkar_11305": "Unbelievably, no! I'm so looking forward to it. Actually conversing in Gobbledegook with a native speaker.",
  "AmitKakkar_11306": "Once I grew bored with the classics, I devoured goblin writings. I'd tell you some titles, but you wouldn't understand them.",
  "AmitKakkar_11307": "Cannot wait to confirm subtle bits of pronunciation and tone that may have eluded me – being self-taught, and all.",
  "AmitKakkar_11308": "You are very welcome. I'm looking forward to meeting your friend, Lodgok.",
  "AmitKakkar_11309": "Of course! How exciting! I mean, well, might this be dangerous?",
  "AmitKakkar_11310": "Greetings, Lodgok. It is an honour, sir.",
  "AmitKakkar_11311": "Of course, we Ravenclaws tend to do well in any class. ",
  "AmitKakkar_11313": "There must be more notes around here. What could they be building?",
  "AmitKakkar_11314": "I need a moment to catch my breath. This was more than I bargained for.",
  "AmitKakkar_11315": "This is not good. They're building enormous drills. Bigger than this mine could contain.",
  "AmitKakkar_11318": "Good to hear. Good to hear. If Sirona trusts him, then I feel much better.",
  "AmitKakkar_11319": "I will get to the bottom of what they've been building down here.",
  "AmitKakkar_11320": "Let me know if you see any more plans or schematics. We can't return to Lodgok empty-'headed.'",
  "AmitKakkar_11321": "I can, Sir Lodgok.",
  "AmitKakkar_11322": "Sir Scagglethorpe the Heedless once challenged a mountain troll to a game of musical chairs. Care to guess who won?",
  "AmitKakkar_11325": "We'll know it when we see it. Onwards we go, then.",
  "AmitKakkar_11326": "Hello! Good to see you outside the castle!",
  "AmitKakkar_11327": "Hello there!",
  "AmitKakkar_11328": "Look at this lift. Impressive workmanship for so simple a device.",
  "AmitKakkar_11329": "Devil's Snare. Nasty stuff if we're not careful.",
  "AmitKakkar_11333": "Goblin-cut glass, first-rate optical enchantments. Hate to think such a fine instrument is just collecting dust.",
  "AmitKakkar_11334": "Oh, of course. It's just not as – tidy – as I expected.",
  "AmitKakkar_11335": "It was. It really was. I'm afraid I've had enough adventure for one day.  For a lifetime, perhaps.",
  "AmitKakkar_11337": "Steam powered, obviously.",
  "AmitKakkar_11338": "This must be a boiler. It needs to be heated to function properly.",
  "AmitKakkar_11339": "Couldn't be simpler, really. Light a boiler to power it up. Then we can proceed.",
  "AmitKakkar_11340": "That was a little more than I'm used to.",
  "AmitKakkar_11341": "Oh, this really is too much.",
  "AmitKakkar_11342": "How many of them are there?",
  "AmitKakkar_11343": "Another boiler. This place is more complex than I had expected.",
  "AmitKakkar_11344": "I wonder if the boiler powers the lever. I suspect it must.",
  "AmitKakkar_11345": "The boiler activated that handle. See it?",
  "AmitKakkar_11346": "I see. <i>Accio</i> should easily engage the handle. Marvellously clever.",
  "AmitKakkar_11347": "A welcome sight indeed.",
  "AmitKakkar_11356": "It's all in the throat, really. Gobbledegook, you know. And how you pronounce your 'Rs'.",
  "AmitKakkar_11360": "You hear that too? Oh, thank goodness.",
  "AmitKakkar_11361": "Ah! The tree from that map we found in the well.",
  "AmitKakkar_11362": "So, what is it we are we looking for again?",
  "AmitKakkar_11366": "Are we sure we need to go all the way into the Forbidden Forest? Even if we do have a candlelit path?",
  "AmitKakkar_11367": "Very good. We have what we came for. Shall we go now?",
  "AmitKakkar_11368": "Oh, what if the map leads to goblin treasure?",
  "AmitKakkar_11369": "You know I think I used to own a vest quite similar to that.",
  "AmitKakkar_11370": "Do you think they're wizard-made?",
  "AmitKakkar_11433": "Never thought talking to a magic well would result in finding treasure.",
  "AmitKakkar_11442": "If it weren't for this dire trouble with Ranrok's lot, Mr Oakes's job would be quite pleasant.",
  "AmitKakkar_11443": "Adelaide mentioned her uncle Rowland's camp may lie near Brocburrow – past the river.",
  "AmitKakkar_11444": "If this is Mr Oakes's campsite, we're in for trouble.",
  "AmitKakkar_11445": "We could be discreet – look around without them ever knowing we were here.",
  "AmitKakkar_11446": "If Mr Oakes was here, there's no sign of him now.",
  "AmitKakkar_11447": "Oakes is an experienced trader. He marked that map for a reason.",
  "AmitKakkar_11448": "His journal left behind? This can't be good.",
  "AmitKakkar_11449": "Taking over camps and castles – this is highly unusual for goblins.",
  "AmitKakkar_11450": "Hmm. A part of me hoped it would be cheerier on the inside.",
  "AmitKakkar_11451": "Boiler doors usually need to be lit to operate. This one's probably no exception.",
  "AmitKakkar_11452": "That furnace could be promising.",
  "AmitKakkar_11453": "Try lighting that furnace. It must be connected to the boiler door.",
  "AmitKakkar_11454": "I saw a boiler door on our way down. Perhaps we should take a closer look there.",
  "AmitKakkar_11468": "Can we please talk about what just happened?",
  "AmitKakkar_11470": "We have some spectators. The trials are popular.",
  "AmitKakkar_11472": "Mr Oakes was lucky. Ranrok's lot would never have freed him.",
  "AmitKakkar_11473": "I saw movement higher up in the keep. We should find our way there.",
  "AmitKakkar_11474": "A ladder – that's what we need.",
  "AmitKakkar_11486": "Are we sure about this? A tomb? A sarcophagus? I mean, I feel bad for Samantha's brother, but – are we sure?",
  "AmitKakkar_11487": "My feet! Oh, it's nothing. They are fine. For now.",
  "AmitKakkar_11488": "As if a cursed tomb and sarcophagus was not enough – also a troll?",
  "AmitKakkar_11489": "I hope Samantha appreciates what it took to lift that curse. I'd keep beets for feet if I knew I had to do that again.",
  "AmitKakkar_11490": "I suppose we know what happened to Mary Portman now. She was breeding the spiders.",
  "AmitKakkar_11491": "This must be Aranshire. We had better keep an eye out for spiders.",
  "AmitKakkar_11492": "A ladder. Not sure I want to know where this leads.",
  "AmitKakkar_11493": "That's the last of the spider sacs.",
  "AmitKakkar_11494": "I hope that's the last spider.",
  "AmitKakkar_11495": "Oh, thank Merlin! Well done. I believe it is dead.",
  "AmitKakkar_11517": "Never do get tired of seeing the Astronomy Tower at night. What a view.",
  "AmitKakkar_11518": "Oh, um, certainly.",
  "AmitKakkar_11519": "I suppose because there is so much to learn about them.",
  "AmitKakkar_11520": "I mean, there is plenty to learn about a lot of subjects, but Astronomy seems limitless. Always something new being discovered.",
  "AmitKakkar_11521": "Oh. Very well, then.",
  "AmitKakkar_11522": "According to an old astronomer's chronicle I found in the library, it may be somewhere along the castle wall.",
  "AmitKakkar_11523": "They are forever discovering new moons and stars. In fact, they discovered a new planet just fifty years ago!",
  "AmitKakkar_11524": "I suppose there are worse fates.",
  "AmitKakkar_11525": "I suspect most things can be mended.",
  "AmitKakkar_11526": "That – was an accident. Was it not?",
  "AmitKakkar_11527": "Oh, this is not wise.",
  "AmitKakkar_11528": "Terrible fate for such a beautiful beast.",
  "AmitKakkar_11529": "Quite a spectacle!",
  "AmitKakkar_11555": "Rest in peace from your misguided life.",
  "AmitKakkar_11556": "Those poachers should have known better. It was a foolhardy pursuit.",
  "AmitKakkar_11557": "That's the last Loyalist. Unfortunate, really. I'd imagine most goblins to be brilliant and kind.",
  "AmitKakkar_11558": "Nothing so chilling as being stared at by all those eyes.",
  "AmitKakkar_11559": "The poor brute. Not his size, which is good. Very weak intellect.",
  "AmitKakkar_11590": "I must not let one troll attack keep me from leaving the school grounds. There is too much to learn out there in the world.",
  "AmitKakkar_11591": "Had I have been one of Ranrok's goblins, I would have suggested a much better plan. (sigh)",
  "AmitKakkar_11592": "Oh no. Not in my vicinity please.",
  "AmitKakkar_11594": "Please don't do that!",
  "AmitKakkar_11619": "Oh! Pardon me.",
  "AnabelCalhoun_10030": "We used to be able to enter the swamp nearby, but it's damned near impassable now.",

  "AndrewLarson_10374": "I've heard rumours of a goblin painter travelling about. Don't tell Binns. He'd lecture us on goblin art for a week.",
  "AndrewLarson_10375": "I'm bored with goblin rebellions. I'd like to rebel against discussing them any further.",
  "AndrewLarson_10390": "I'd much rather be studying art. That's historic too, isn't it?",
  "AndrewLarson_10403": "'Accidentally' transfigured your bookwork into a toad? Weasley's never going to believe that.",

  "AnneSallow_10192": "Oh, dear Professor Hecat. She's a powerful witch – and she knows how to keep students like my brother – and me – in line.",
  "AnneSallow_10193": "(sigh) I do miss Hogwarts. But I wouldn't mind being in Feldcroft, really, if it wasn't so dreary now.",
  "AnneSallow_10196": "Sebastian cannot take away my pain. Perhaps you can help him to understand that.",
  "AnneSallow_10202": "Oh, the common room. I adored teasing first-years about spotting mermaids through the window.",
  "AnneSallow_10204": "They both mean well. I know they do. But my uncle is right. This curse cannot be undone. I can feel it.",
  "AnneSallow_10206": "Does Ominis know about this?",
  "AnneSallow_10209": "Sebastian – a lost relic from a catacomb which requires a Dark sacrifice?",
  "AnneSallow_10210": "Very well. If Ominis will be there, I'll meet you. We don't have much time. Solomon wants to leave Feldcroft.",
  "AnneSallow_10211": "I shall do my best. I'll be in touch.",
  "AnneSallow_10213": "Ominis – he was willing to put the whole hamlet and himself in danger on the chance that some old relic could help to heal me.",
  "AnneSallow_10214": "I'm sorry, Ominis. Make sure he's all right, will you?",
  "AnneSallow_10215": "Sebastian has gone too far. You saw what lies in the catacomb. I cannot stay here.",
  "AnneSallow_10217": "I'm getting tired. I should probably rest. Thank you for stopping by.",
  "AnneSallow_10219": "You didn't. Truly. (wince) And I'm all right. The pain from this curse comes in bouts – and often suddenly. It's not anyone's fault.",
  "AnneSallow_10223": "Between the goblins at the castle and my uncle fighting with Sebastian whenever he's home – it's not the cosy retreat it once was.",
  "AnneSallow_10225": "Uncle Solomon is frustrated. (wince) By what happened to me – and by Sebastian for thinking he can fix it.",
  "AnneSallow_10226": "(screams)",
  "AnneSallow_10227": "(pained cries)",

  "AnneThisbe_10024": "Let me be, once and for all! Let me die!",
  "AnneThisbe_10025": "Aaaaaaaaah! The book, the book. No one would look. None of the mages found the pages.",

  "ArthurSiggs_10733": "Asked Poppy if she'd be interested as well, but couldn't drag her away from her Puffskein.",
  "ArthurSiggs_10734": "Fair enough. Meet me back here if you find anything.",
  "ArthurSiggs_10735": "He shooed me out of there, but not before I got a few Galleons richer. What did you find?",
  "ArthurSiggs_10738": "Hmm. Based on a cursory review of your map, I'd suggest somewhere near Hecat's classroom.",
  "ArthurSiggs_10740": "Sorry your map didn't lead to more! Perhaps next time.",
  "ArthurSiggs_10741": "Some people take to a broom like a Dugbog to mud.",
  "ArthurSiggs_10742": "Not sure I'd do well riding a Graphorn.",
  "ArthurSiggs_10743": "Hmph. Must take a fair amount of patience flying a Hippogriff.",
  "ArthurSiggs_10744": "Perhaps you've made yourself a bit too comfortable here.",
  "ArthurSiggs_10745": "Poor old Professor Fig. I feel as if I hardly knew him.",
  "ArthurSiggs_10746": "I shall be extra careful wandering about Hogsmeade now. Don't want a troll sneaking up on me.",
  "ArthurSiggs_10747": "Seems odd that Ranrok and his lot attacked from underneath the school.",
  "ArthurSiggs_10748": "I should report you to the Ministry for that.",
  "ArthurSiggs_10749": "No measly lock's going to stop you, eh?",
  "ArthurSiggs_10751": "What did I ever do to you?",
  "ArthurSiggs_10752": "Galleons and a historian's uniform – it was brilliant solving those old treasure maps.",
  "ArthurSiggs_10753": "Didn't see me? It happens, I suppose.",
  "ArthurSiggs_10754": "Glad I don't have to clean that up.",
  "AstoriaCrickett_10016": "I hear Ferdinand's found a new home – the Hog's Head! He must be delighted.",
  "AstoriaCrickett_10018": "That depends – am I in trouble?",
  "AstoriaCrickett_10026": "Oh, for the love of Merlin –",
  "AstoriaCrickett_10032": "Ferdinand Pratt is a pustulant boil, and he's lucky I didn't have him sealed in a wall.",
  "AstoriaCrickett_10036": "I wouldn't call it stolen. Relocated's more like it.",
  "AstoriaCrickett_10038": "How do I put this nicely –",
  "AstoriaCrickett_10041": "I just wanted it far enough away that I'd never have to think about Ferdinand Pratt ever again.",
  "AstoriaCrickett_10042": "If you ask me he's got nothing to scream about. I could've had him put in the Hog's Head.",
  "AstoriaCrickett_10044": "I hope it was worth it – bringing Ferdinand back to the Three Broomsticks.",
  "AstoriaCrickett_10045": "I can't believe we have to put up with Ferdinand again because of you.",
  "AstoriaCrickett_10046": "I feel sorry for your next opponent.",
  "AstoriaCrickett_10047": "All he does is spy on students in here and report back to the Headmaster.",
  "AstoriaCrickett_10048": "I didn't put him anywhere. The frame is likely with the fine gents I paid to snatch it. They camp in a ruin by the coast.",
  "AstoriaCrickett_10049": "I spent four hours in detention last week, all because he told Black that I was planning to 'drain the lake' –whatever that means.",
  "AstoriaCrickett_10050": "Sometimes, if there's nothing to report, he'll make it up.",
  "AstoriaCrickett_10051": "It was the last straw. He and his frame had to go.",
  "AstoriaCrickett_10052": "The pampered prat would've hated it; grimy walls, smell of goats.  And the patrons. They eat snooty princes like Ferdinand for dinner.",
  "AstoriaCrickett_10053": "But what's done is done. He isn't here anymore, and if I were you, I should enjoy it.",
  "AstoriaCrickett_10057": "Lovely chatting with you.",
  "AstoriaCrickett_10058": "This'll be your last round.",
  "AstoriaCrickett_10059": "We'll make you regret signing up.",
  "AugustusHill_10117": "I sell even more 'battle-worthy' items, should you be inclined. You're most welcome to peruse my shop at your leisure.",
  "AugustusHill_10120": "Nonsense. I insist.",
  "AugustusHill_10122": "It's the least I can do.",
  "AugustusHill_10131": "Hello there! A moment if you would.",
  "AugustusHill_10135": "And as I suspect this won't be your last dangerous encounter, I'd like to give you one such set of robes – in thanks for what you did today.",
  "AugustusHill_10141": "I own Gladrags Wizardwear and among my inventory are some unique items that afford certain – protections as it were. Life-saving protections.",
  "AugustusHill_10142": "Now, let's try this on for size, shall we?",
  "AugustusHill_10143": "I should like to thank you for your remarkable bravery in fighting those trolls – not to mention your help restoring Hogsmeade to its rightful state.",
  "AugustusHill_10147": "Allow me to introduce myself: Augustus Hill, clothier extraordinaire.",
  "AugustusHill_10148": "Frankly, you deserve an Order of Merlin! But I can offer you something much more useful.",
  "AugustusHill_10158": "Dashing pyjamas. You didn’t buy those here, did you?",
  "AugustusHill_10159": "I don't know how you and Miss Onai did it, but we're all highly pleased to be rid of Theophilus Harlow.",
  "AugustusHill_10160": "I've heard that our dear Clementine drew you into her butterfly escapades. Unusual girl. Still, it takes all sorts.",
  "AugustusHill_10161": "Where did you learn that sort of magic?",
  "AugustusHill_10163": "Outside if you please. I have very delicate fabrics in here.",
  "AugustusHill_10164": "Hello there. Come on in and have a look around. No touching if you have sticky fingers.",
  "AugustusHill_10165": "Well, hello there. Come in, look around – and if you've been eating Chocolate Frogs please refrain from touching.",
  "AugustusHill_10166": "Hello there. Ready for a little change in fashion, are we? Plenty to choose from here so take your time.",
  "AugustusHill_10167": "Before you ask, I'm all out of the new socks, so if your feet are smelly you'll have to work it out for yourself.",
  "AugustusHill_10168": "Hello there. Please, come in. Let me know if you need help finding anything.",
  "AugustusHill_10169": "You won't be disappointed. That's a Gladrag's promise.",
  "AugustusHill_10170": "If I haven't said it before, it's a pleasure doing business with you.",
  "AugustusHill_10171": "Ah. I'm afraid that's a little outside of your means. For now at least.",
  "AugustusHill_10172": "I'd say that looks as if it was made for you.",
  "AugustusHill_10173": "I suspect you have a sharp eye for fashion. Be sure to stop by whenever you're about.",
  "AugustusHill_10174": "Plenty for your perusal today. Take your time.",
  "AugustusHill_10175": "Hello there. I always find I can take things in a little better after dark myself. Less distraction. Feel free to browse.",
  "AugustusHill_10176": "One can be spoiled for choice, can't they? I'm here to advise should you need me.",
  "AugustusHill_10177": "Pardon me.",
  "AugustusHill_10178": "I realise that school has its pressures but my child there are better ways to cope than this.",

  "BaiHowin_10997": "Welcome everyone.",
  "BaiHowin_10998": "I see you've already met some of the many beasts we study in this class.",
  "BaiHowin_10999": "Though, be advised, none of these creatures should be taken lightly. They are all, in their own way, dangerous – especially if one does not know how to handle them properly.",
  "BaiHowin_11000": "Now, it seems many of you are out of practice. Let's take some time to review the basics of how to care for a beast, shall we?",
  "BaiHowin_11001": "Miss Sweeting, would you please assist our new student with the lesson today?",
  "BaiHowin_11002": "Miss Sweeting, pay attention, please. The tongue of a Puffskein can be a slippery devil.",
  "BaiHowin_11003": "It appears our time has come to an end. Please close the pens and see yourselves out.",
  "BaiHowin_11009": "Good work everyone. Now, let's make our way to the pens and select another beast.",
  "BaiHowin_11011": "Miss Sweeting, why don't you show our new student to the Kneazles in the farthest pen?",
  "BaiHowin_11012": "And please, do be careful as you feed and groom them.",
  "BaiHowin_11013": "I did. How did you find your first Beasts lesson?",
  "BaiHowin_11014": "Good. You seem to understand that when beasts are properly controlled, they can play a vital role in our lives.",
  "BaiHowin_11015": "Wouldn't know it, the way you handled them. You'll soon learn that properly controlled beasts can play a vital role in our lives.",
  "BaiHowin_11023": "One moment. I would like a word.",
  "BaiHowin_11024": "Over here, if you please.",
  "BaiHowin_11031": "Though we all know Puffskein hair is an ingredient in Laughing Potion, that is not our goal today.",
  "BaiHowin_11032": "I needn't remind you, do not toss the Puffskeins about. I do not care how much they – and you – enjoy it.",
  "BaiHowin_11033": "A small amount of food is all that is needed. Feeding them any more is unhealthy and irresponsible.",
  "BaiHowin_11034": "Once you see past the Puffskein's lovable façade, you will find their usefulness marginal to say the least.",
  "BaiHowin_11110": "Now, where is our new student? Ah, there you are. I would like a moment, please.",
  "BaiHowin_11125": "Professor Weasley has asked that I prepare some assignments designed to help you catch up to the other fifth-years.",
  "BaiHowin_11126": "You will find it is similar to your work with the Puffskeins.",
  "BaiHowin_11132": "Yes? Do you need assistance with something?",
  "BaiHowin_11133": "Is there something you would like to ask me? I am here to help.",
  "BaiHowin_11255": "Completing the tasks will ensure that you're ready to learn <i>Bombarda</i>, the Exploding Charm.",
  "BaiHowin_11257": "Excellent wandwork! Cast the spell just like that every time. Assured and in-control.",
  "BaiHowin_11268": "Good. Now, this spell comes with a caveat: it should only be used when necessary.",
  "BaiHowin_11269": "The Exploding Charm, as you might suspect, can hurt people. Use caution when casting it.",
  "BaiHowin_11270": "I will hold you to that promise.",
  "BaiHowin_11271": "Better for you to learn it in school – where we can instruct you properly as to its use, hm?",
  "BaiHowin_11273": "Now – you must be precise in your wand movements. We don't want you blowing your hand off. Go ahead.",
  "BaiHowin_11277": "I have been asked to teach you the Exploding Charm, <i>Bombarda</i>. Once you have completed the tasks I've set forth, speak to me after class.",
  "BaiHowin_11278": "Meanwhile, I also encourage you to study as many beasts as you can on your own time.",
  "BaiHowin_11279": "Excellent work today. Class dismissed.",
  "BaiHowin_11280": "I believe you and I have matters to discuss.",
  "BaiHowin_11281": "I take it you're ready to learn your new spell.",
  "BaiHowin_11282": "Well done. Now, let us put it into practice, shall we? Go ahead and try it on the pumpkins.",
  "BaiHowin_11283": "Excellent! You have it well in hand.",
  "BaiHowin_11284": "Nice and steady wand movements. Remember: the Exploding Charm is highly volatile.",
  "BaiHowin_11300": "They're nearly as bad as the savages in Rookwood's Poacher Pack.  Sadly, we're the ones who suffer.",
  "BaiHowin_11306": "Stumbling over dead beasts. Terrible waste of resources.",
  "BaiHowin_11307": "Hmm. An optimistic idea. Now, why don't we focus on more immediate matters that we can control?",
  "BaiHowin_11309": "Be on the lookout for my owl.",
  "BaiHowin_11318": "Some provide us with magically imbued materials – if cared for correctly.",
  "BaiHowin_11319": "Which does not include torturing them for whiskers. Well done, by the way. Probably best to let me handle it next time.",
  "BaiHowin_11342": "Yes, what is it?",
  "BaiHowin_11343": "I see. I suppose that seeking to understand the motivation for selecting one's path is a worthy pursuit.",
  "BaiHowin_11344": "Are you considering some sort of profession in the field?",
  "BaiHowin_11345": "Hmm. You do seem to engage well with the beasts in class.",
  "BaiHowin_11346": "(sigh) Very well.",
  "BaiHowin_11347": "I wondered if it was possible that an Occamy could be so nearby. Hence, I went to find it.",
  "BaiHowin_11348": "He was near a tree hollow. And there, inside, was a nest with seven silver Occamy eggs.",
  "BaiHowin_11349": "I believe that when choosing a path – particularly of a scholarly nature – one must take into account both one's enthusiasm for a particular subject –",
  "BaiHowin_11350": "I knew of the Occamy, of course, from my studies, but they are native to lands east of here, such as India.",
  "BaiHowin_11351": "Beasts and all that they provide will vastly improve your life – and perhaps, one day, even save it.",
  "BaiHowin_11352": "– as well as how one may best serve the students to whom one is obligated to both inspire and teach.",
  "BaiHowin_11353": "Nothing. Beasts are to be valued for what they can provide for wizardkind; protective clothing, potion ingredients – even wand cores.",
  "BaiHowin_11354": "I recall it quite vividly. It was the summer between my sixth and seventh years.",
  "BaiHowin_11355": "Its eggs are made of pure silver, hence the desire to trade in them.",
  "BaiHowin_11356": "Now, I trust that I have answered your question. You would do well to continue your study of beasts, regardless of your chosen path.",
  "BaiHowin_11357": "Indeed. I knew in that moment that I needed to understand all that I could about beasts, and ensure that wizardkind learned to benefit properly from them.",
  "BaiHowin_11358": "I read in the <i>Prophet</i> about a wizard who'd been selling Occamy eggs and disappeared in the mountains near my home.",
  "BaiHowin_11359": "Only poachers see the value in ending a beast's life for Galleons. I left the eggs alone.",
  "BaiHowin_11360": "I hid. And moments later, the beast flew right over my head. Breathtaking. She then seemed to all but disappear as she shrunk to fit into the hollow.",
  "BaiHowin_11361": "It is a spectacular beast. A feathered, winged serpent-like creature that can grow or shrink to fit a particular space.",
  "BaiHowin_11362": "It was. After a few days – during which my parents grew increasingly annoyed at my absence – I found what little remained of the wizard 'egg trader'.",
  "BaiHowin_11363": "I think you may have forgotten your decorum.",
  "BaiHowin_11364": "Shame about Professor Fig.",
  "BaiHowin_11365": "Something very odd about that troll attack in Hogsmeade.",
  "BaiHowin_11366": "If I never hear the name Ranrok again –",
  "BaiHowin_11367": "I would think very carefully how you use that spell.",
  "BaiHowin_11369": "Textbook execution. Bravo.",
  "BaiHowin_11370": "Excuse you.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10011": "Hello there! Do you have the special delivery from my dear friend Eddie?",
  "BernardNdiaye_10013": "Yes, he told me to expect you. Do you have the Chinese Chomping Cabbages?",
  "BernardNdiaye_10014": "How unfortunate. I do think Eddie's idea has merit. I'm not sure how many more attacks Feldcroft can survive.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10015": "We met at Hogwarts. Been friends and business associates ever since.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10016": "No clue. I used to think it was because of its strategic location, but now it's as if they were looking for something.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10017": "I will admit, however, that I don't know what they could possibly be looking for.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10018": "Glad to see you back. Do you have the Chinese Chomping Cabbages?",
  "BernardNdiaye_10019": "I wasn't surprised to get his owl about his Chinese Chomping Cabbage scheme. He was always one to go out of his way to help another.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10020": "Feldcroft owes a debt of gratitude to you and Eddie. Thank you for your help.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10021": "Welcome. I am Bernard Ndiaye and this is my shop. Is there anything I can help you with?",
  "BernardNdiaye_10022": "Nice to see you as well. How can I help you?",
  "BernardNdiaye_10024": "Feldcroft borders goblin country, but we've always lived in peace with their kind – until recently, that is.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10025": "Some claim that Belgruff and his associates are in league with Ranrok. I don't know if there's truth to it.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10026": "The good news is that Belgruff the Bludgeoner has been killed, evidently. It's a huge relief to us all.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10028": "I don't know what he expected to gain by pestering us like that, but we're certainly glad to be rid of him.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10029": "Nothing much, really. Although – do you know Sebastian Sallow? He attends Hogwarts like you, I believe. About your age.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10030": "His uncle lives here in Feldcroft, but I hear they had a bit of falling out. Haven't seen him since. Shame, really.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10031": "His sister's still here, but – well, you may not even know the boy. Good lad, though. Always liked him.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10032": " An incredibly unpleasant goblin called Belgruff the Bludgeoner has been tormenting everyone he encounters.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10033": "Well, our hamlet's in mourning at the moment, unfortunately. We recently lost one of our own – Solomon Sallow, a longtime resident.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10034": "Died in his sleep, and so young. Tragic twist of fate. We've all taken it rather hard actually.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10035": "The worst part is, he was guardian to his nephew and niece. She's particularly devastated, poor girl.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10036": "Glad you asked. I sell the finest array of beast byproducts you'll find in the entire countryside.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10037": "If you don't believe me, feel free to look about. Eventually you'll return. They always do.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10038": "Beautiful place, isn't it? Although I admit I didn't choose it. It chose me. I was raised here. It's always been my home.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10039": "I've always loved working with beasts. And my twin girls adore them. Wouldn't be surprised if they took over from me one day.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10040": "As for the shop, I suppose my line of work chose me as well.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10043": "Whatever the case, their constant meddling is devastating business. Everyone feels unsafe. It's quite serious.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10044": "We've seen quite enough goblins for the time being.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10046": "Something must be done. That Belgruff the Bludgeoner has disrupted my business.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10047": " Who would come to our hamlet to do business when we're routinely overrun by goblins?",
  "BernardNdiaye_10048": "I can't stop thinking about Solomon or his niece or nephew. I've known them for so long. They're like family to me.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10049": "It is a glorious day in Feldcroft. Belgruff the Bludgeoner has finally met his demise.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10050": "At last some reinforcements. Hopefully this is enough to thwart the goblins.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10051": "Marvellous! This will go a long way towards protecting the hamlet from Ranrok's Loyalists.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10052": "The same foul curs who – I am willing to guess – intercepted them in the first place, along with Rookwood's lot.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10053": "Oh, it doesn't appear that you do.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10054": "Didn't care to get dressed for the day?",
  "BernardNdiaye_10055": "They're not teaching you that at Hogwarts, are they?",
  "BernardNdiaye_10057": "Oho! That's my daughter's favourite spell!",
  "BernardNdiaye_10058": "And what brings you to Feldcroft today?",
  "BernardNdiaye_10059": "Now if you like what you bought, be sure to come in and see me again.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10060": "A pleasure doing business with you.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10061": "I'm afraid that's a little out of your price range.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10062": "Have I mentioned you’re welcome to stop by any time?",
  "BernardNdiaye_10063": "What are we in the market for today?",
  "BernardNdiaye_10064": "A bit distracted, are we?",
  "BernardNdiaye_10065": "You know just because you can break it doesn't mean you should.",
  "BernardNdiaye_10066": "Their constant meddling is devastating business. Everyone feels unsafe. It's quite serious.",
  "BettyBowditch_10032": "Word has it that with the right loom, you can weave magic into almost any clothing item. Wonder if Gladrags would do that for me?",
  "BettyBowditch_10033": "My friend Hazel is hiding in fear somewhere in the Forbidden Forest. She's a beautiful, bright unicorn.",
  "BettyBowditch_10034": "I was hoping you could get her somewhere safe so she can heal.",
  "BettyBowditch_10035": "Oh, bless you. Thank you for asking. I'm Betty. Betty Bugbrooke. And, no. Everything is not all right.",
  "BettyBowditch_10036": "Yes. She's a unicorn. Known her for years.",
  "BettyBowditch_10037": "She doesn't like to leave the forest, so I visit her once a week to brush out her mane and bring her some treats. Her coat is glorious.",
  "BettyBowditch_10038": "I want to help her, but she seems to have gone into hiding – out of fear, I'd imagine.",
  "BettyBowditch_10039": "I know you Hogwarts students learn a fair bit about caring for beasts.",
  "BettyBowditch_10040": "Perhaps you could find my unicorn friend and get her somewhere safe so that she can heal.",
  "BettyBowditch_10041": "Oh, you've a good soul. I can always tell. Please don't risk your own safety, though.",
  "BettyBowditch_10043": "I don't know precisely where she is, but I can tell you that her den is north of Hogsmeade.",
  "BettyBowditch_10044": "Well, the last time I saw her, we were violently attacked by a pack of wolves!",
  "BettyBowditch_10047": "It was luck, truly. I came across her when she was a little, golden foal; didn't even have a horn yet.",
  "BettyBowditch_10050": "It's my dear friend Hazel – she's in trouble.",

  "BettyBowditch_10063": "Oh, what a relief! Is she all right? Are you all right? Do you have a safe place for her to stay?",
  "BettyBowditch_10064": "Oh, I'm so relieved. And, of course. It's worth almost any amount of Galleons to make sure my dear girl is cared for.",
  "BettyBowditch_10065": "You've a kind heart, you do. I'm relieved and thankful that you'll take care of her.",
  "BettyBowditch_10066": "I shall miss my sweet, pointy pony, but I know she's safer away from the poachers. Do give her a nice brushing for me, won't you?",
  "BettyBowditch_10069": "Hazel, loyal friend that she is, leapt in front to protect me and, in the process, I fear she may have been injured.",
  "BettyBowditch_10070": "And although I haven't been able to brush her lately, I imagine she still has the brightest, most beautiful coat of her entire herd.",
  "BettyBowditch_10071": "– but I'm terrified those poachers will want her for her blood, to keep themselves alive. And that is more than I can bear to think of.",
  "BettyBowditch_10073": "I beg your pardon, but would you mind helping out an old woman?",
  "BettyBowditch_10074": "Remember, you'll know her by her brilliant coat. And be warned, she's a stubborn girl. She may need some convincing to come with you.",

  "CalliopeSnelling_10020": "But I showed them! They're stuck in the dust at the Ministry and I'm here thriving. Absolutely thriving!",
  "CalliopeSnelling_10021": "But look at you! Look – at – you! I can certainly see why you paid me a visit.",
  "CalliopeSnelling_10022": "Looking for a change, are we?",
  "CalliopeSnelling_10025": "Some are going for that Muggle with consumption sort of Death becomes me allure.",
  "CalliopeSnelling_10026": "But you won't find poisons here. No need for chloride of lime or ammonia when you have magic.",
  "CalliopeSnelling_10027": "Why don't you spend a moment choosing how you'd like to look. You can change your hair too if you'd like.",
  "CalliopeSnelling_10048": "Well. I see someone's due for a visit to Gladrags.",
  "CalliopeSnelling_10049": "Mark of a warrior, you're in line for, taking that man down.",
  "CalliopeSnelling_10050": "I will not have that sort of magic brought inside my shop.",
  "CalliopeSnelling_10052": "Eh! I'll have none of that round here. You can take that nonsense elsewhere.",
  "CalliopeSnelling_10053": "Ah, hello. And how would one like to be styled today?",
  "CalliopeSnelling_10054": "Come on in, come on in. Don't be shy.",
  "CalliopeSnelling_10055": "You take care now, and I shall hope to see you soon.",
  "CalliopeSnelling_10056": "I should think a bit of mud on your face is all you can afford.",

  "ChiyoKogawa_10319": "– that's right –",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10320": "Now – mount your broomstick.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10321": "One leg over so there's a leg on each side – none of that side-saddle nonsense, a gust of wind will throw you right off.",

  "ChiyoKogawa_10331": "Up!",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10332": "Thank you.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10333": "This, I fear, some of you have forgotten.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10334": "Diving, rolling, and loop-the-loops will not be taught or, in fact, tolerated in this class – we'll leave that to professional Quidditch players like the Toyohashi Tengu.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10335": "Mr Clopton – your attention, please.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10337": "Now, let's see how well everyone kept up with their practice over the summer holidays.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10338": "Not a fan, I take it.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10339": "Everyone please welcome a new student to our Flying Class.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10340": "The goal of today is to remind all of you how to manoeuvre on a broomstick safely, as broom flight is first and foremost a means of transportation.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10344": "Good grip!",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10345": "Nice balance!",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10346": "Excellent!",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10348": "Yes – good – and lean.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10377": "Well done. Now that you're acclimatised to your broom, let's see how well you manage with a more advanced exercise, shall we?",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10379": "For those who need a refresher, step up to your broom, say ‘up’ firmly and clearly, then kick your leg over and rest your weight on the seat.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10380": "And, if you hear my whistle while you're in flight, ground yourself at once.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10381": "And, where have you two been?",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10382": "Hefty points will be taken from each of you, for not following my instructions.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10383": "Mr Clopton, I'm disappointed in you. You’re in this class because you're sti –",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10384": "– because you're still not showing yourself, or frankly, your broom, the proper respect.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10385": "Enough.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10386": "Class is finished for the day.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10387": "As for you, you’d do well to use better judgement in the future.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10389": "Chin up. That was some rather good flying.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10557": "I should like to speak with you, Professor.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10558": "Professor Black. Again, it is not too late to reconsider your decision regarding Quidditch.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10559": "Professor – more than one student has taken a Bludger to the head on our pitch. I daresay it knocked some sense into them.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10560": "Certainly. I'd like to know that you have the discipline and resolve to handle a new spell by completing a few assignments first.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10561": "Report to me when these tasks are finished, and then you will be ready to learn <i>Arresto Momentum</i>.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10572": "Wisdom is a Golden Snitch, as they say. And you're proving a skilled Seeker in that regard.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10573": "Well done. Shows good discipline.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10579": "You're also welcome to drop by any time with questions.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10686": "Professor? A word?",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10789": "A silly game? I – You are quite impossible sometimes. Sir.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10791": "What did we do to deserve him as a Headmaster?",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10792": "Good. Now: for your first lesson, fly through each ring in the courtyard.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10903": "To prepare you to learn <i>Glacius</i>. Come and see me when you're finished and we will go over it together.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10904": "Wonderful. I trust you became more familiar with your broom through the process?",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10905": "Use <i>Glacius</i> wisely – it is more versatile than you may think. And don't forget to practise your flying!",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10906": "No need to discuss it further. Losing points for Ravenclaw should serve as a deterrent against future escapades.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10911": "Now, Professor Weasley has asked that I teach you a few additional spells, so please keep an eye out for an owl from me.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10923": "I believe you are ready to learn <i>Arresto Momentum</i>, the Slowing Charm. It allows you to freeze objects or people in midair. Simply complete a few tasks and then come and see me.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10924": "<i>Arresto Momentum!</i>",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10925": "<i>Accio!</i>",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10926": "But – if this happens again it’ll be a most gruesome detention.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10927": "Marvellous dedication to the sport.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10928": "Nobody is getting punished, bar perhaps a little clean up of the grounds.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10929": "Well done. You are on your way to mastering <i>Arresto Momentum</i>.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10930": "Very good. I recommend practising your new spell as much as possible – perhaps before you leave here.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10931": "That's it. Keep it up.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10933": "How did you get on with those tasks?",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10939": "That's good to hear. Keep it up and perhaps one day you'll have a spot on the Quidditch team.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10940": "You may not realise it, but steady practice and discipline will undoubtedly improve your flying skills.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10941": "Well, with those tasks out of the way, let us get started. <i>Glacius</i>.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10942": "Pay attention to your wandwork.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10943": "Very deliberate movements.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10945": "While these assignments are meant to help further your magical education –",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10946": "This next set of rings will take you around the grounds – for more of a challenge.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10947": "No need to discuss it further. Losing points for Hufflepuff should serve as a deterrent against future escapades.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10948": "No need to discuss it further. Losing points for Slytherin should serve as a deterrent against future escapades.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10949": "No need to discuss it further. Losing points for Gryffindor should serve as a deterrent against future escapades.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10951": "Well done. I'd recommend that you practise your new spell here in my office before taking it out into the world.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10952": "There you go! Catching on quickly.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10953": "If Black ever permits Quidditch again.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10954": "I would not assign you work that I did not believe was beneficial to you.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10956": "Good luck with your assignments.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10957": "Welcome back. Have you finished your assignments?",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10958": "Hello there. Ready to get to work?",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10959": "Precise, deliberate movements.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10962": "Do take care. The brooms are school property. I want them returned in one piece.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10964": "I think it's learned its lesson. But do continue to practise as long as you like.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10965": "Kinaesthesia is a powerful learning tool.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10966": "And they're fine now. The fact that it happened to be a pure-blood, well, that's no reason to –",
  "ChiyoKogawa_10981": "– there's no reason you can't have a bit of fun on your broom whilst you complete them.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11000": "We – we could still have trials and a somewhat shortened season. It would be better than none at all.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11001": "I've a good mind to write to the Department of Magical Games and Sports at the Ministry about you.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11002": "I – parchment? Very well, I will – and with pleasure! And I spotted Scrope in the Great Hall. Seems to be avoiding me.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11003": "I – good day, Professor. And I spotted Scrope in the Great Hall. Seems to be avoiding me.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11004": "Let us practise <i>Arresto Momentum</i>. A charm, incidentally, created to stop Quaffles from plummeting straight to the ground during a Quidditch match.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11005": "I did. The Toyohashi Tengu are from Japan. Dominant. Known for their rigorous training.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11010": "They practise near the Mahoutokoro School of Magic – often battling both tempestuous seas and violent storms in addition to each other.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11011": "Tournament play is almost always easier for the Tengu than their training sessions.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11012": "Fan? Hmph. I was being groomed to play on their team.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11013": "And I would have been a Tengu, if not for – a bit of bad luck.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11015": "She was breathtaking. She once corkscrewed through three players and scored before they even turned their heads.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11017": "But as tryouts for the Tengu got closer, she panicked. I did not realise the extent of her panic until it was too late.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11018": "She wanted so desperately for both of us to play together that she had slipped Felix Felicis into our tea before we were to show them our skills.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11023": "Yes, what is it?",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11049": "It does not matter. My flying that day was not my own. I could not live with myself. So, I withdrew and explained to them why.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11050": "And some things are in it. I should have known better. I made my own luck.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11051": "I was excellent. My ability on a broom had nothing to do with what happened.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11052": "I was betrayed by someone I trusted: myself. I did not see clearly and I paid a dear price.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11053": "My best friend Asuka and I were being groomed to play on the team together. I as Keeper and she as Chaser.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11054": "Also known as 'Liquid Luck.' And it is illegal in all wizarding sports.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11055": "It is indeed.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11056": "I knew within minutes that something was different. I had never played so well. And Asuka was playing more beautifully than I had ever seen.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11057": "When I confronted her afterwards, she admitted what she had done.  I withdrew from consideration immediately.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11058": "I burned my broom in disgrace.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11059": "Asuka played for the Tengu for two seasons.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11060": "Her fate was not mine to decide.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11061": "My fate is in my hands. As your fate is in yours.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11071": "I do. And not despite all that happened, but because of it.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11072": "Do you have a question?",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11073": "In some way, yes. But in others, I was ready for another adventure. To bring my experience and knowledge to another realm.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11075": "Oh, do not worry! It is not as if I have anything else to do.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11076": "Ah. I suppose that is not an unexpected question – after I told you about my time at Mahoutokoro.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11077": "We coordinated, shall we say, 'defensive' efforts on a particular matter, and were talking one evening about the rigours of our respective positions.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11078": "It was a simple matter of fate, really. After my experience with the Toyohashi Tengu, I was determined to find work that would fulfil me.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11079": "I accepted a position with the Japanese Ministry of Magic. I cannot tell you the specifics of my work.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11080": "But that is not at all what happened. I was not 'moving on.' What happened will always be a part of me. I learned from it.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11081": "A few years into my post, I had the honour of working with Professor Weasley – at the time a curse breaker for the British Ministry.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11083": "My reason for coming to Hogwarts was to expand my horizons.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11084": "She was. But I would advise you not to inquire upon it. She is quite clear that her focus is now Hogwarts.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11085": "Her description of the school was so enchanting, that when she wrote to me a few years later about the open position of Flying Professor, I was intrigued.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11086": "She mentioned plans to return to Britain and Hogwarts, specifically. I noted I could appreciate her decision.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11087": "You would do well to let lessons be just that: lessons. Learn from your errors – in judgement or otherwise.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11088": "I am proud to impart such knowledge upon students – no matter where in the globe they may reside.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11089": "The dragon should not exhale if it is not looking to engage.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11090": "It's time you learned <i>Glacius</i>, the Freezing Spell. It is an efficient way to cool down a heated situation. But first I will need you to complete a few tasks. Once you have done that, come and see me.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11091": "Befitting attire if you plan to take classes from your bed.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11092": "Hogwarts won't be the same without Professor Fig.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11093": "I've never known trolls to attack an entire village – so viciously.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11094": "Ranrok's Loyalists will certainly disband now.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11095": "You should be proud of completing your Field Guide. I'm sure it wasn't an easy task.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11096": "I should have expected that you and Miss Onai would become friends. You both have a taste for adventure.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11097": "I hope you can help Miss Sweeting come out of her shell now that you've become friends.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11098": "I see that you have befriended Mr Sallow. Hopefully you will be a good influence on one another.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11099": "Mr Thakkar could use an adventurous friend like you.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11100": "Miss Reyes must be teaching you a lot about flying what with all the time you two spend together.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11101": "You and Mr Clopton have spent quite a bit of time together since that first Flying class.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11102": "Where in the name of Merlin did you learn magic like that?",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11104": "The school is indebted to you. Who knows what would have happened with the Loyalists if you hadn't been there.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11105": "Mind where you're aiming.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11106": "Ah, good day to you.",
  "ChiyoKogawa_11107": "You're behaving like a rogue Bludger!",
  "CillianHawksworth_10000": "You there! Might you be able to assist?",
  "CillianHawksworth_10001": "I wonder if you'd be able to help me?",
  "CillianHawksworth_10002": "Might you have a moment for a worried wizard?",
  "CillianHawksworth_10003": "Oh, only I'm desperate. Please – won't you help me?",
  "CillianHawksworth_10004": "Far from it. I wandered into a ruin and was attacked by spiders. ",
  "CillianHawksworth_10005": "You've saved me life! Oh, I can never repay you. Yes, yes, I shall stay away from them. You’ll see.",
  "CillianHawksworth_10006": "Oh. Now I really am doomed. What a horrible way to die!",
  "CillianHawksworth_10007": "How dare you call me a liar! They were everywhere, creepy, crawling things!",
  "CillianHawksworth_10008": "If you've got some Wiggenweld Potion though, I’m sure that would put me right.",
  "CillianHawksworth_10009": "Must stay away from ruins. With spiders. Ruins with spiders.",
  "CillianHawksworth_10010": "Oh, and thank you. Please accept this token of my appreciation.",
  "CillianHawksworth_10011": "I hope I survive the night.",
  "CillianHawksworth_10012": "I shall be a ghost soon! But don't you fret because I shall haunt you!",
  "CillianHawksworth_10013": "I'm doomed.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10022": "I did. Never imagined they'd act this deadly. I'm Claire Beaumont, by the way.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10028": "I'm simply at my wit's end.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10031": "(sigh) Bardolph had spent the entire day hand-picking herbs and roots for us.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10033": "Much as I would love to be rid of them,  I wouldn't want you to risk injury – or worse. Please be cautious.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10037": "To the south – across the river. Last I heard, there were several Loyalists in each camp.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10039": "I'm afraid not. I fear my brother is only one of many who will have suffered at their hands by the time they move on – if they ever do.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10040": "When a group of Ranrok's lot appeared and demanded the harvest for themselves, Bardolph refused.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10041": "You cleared them out? How?",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10042": "You've saved our hamlet, my young friend. This will not be forgotten.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10044": "I wish my brother could have done what you did. Perhaps he'd still be with me now.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10046": "Ranrok's Loyalists are not to be underestimated.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10047": "Mind yourself beyond our borders. Ranrok's Loyalists have taken hold here.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10048": "Be alert. Ranrok's Loyalists are unpredictable and violent.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10049": "Ranrok's Loyalists won't hold back – not even with a student.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10051": "Upper Hogsfield is being terrorised by Ranrok's Loyalists – it's not right.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10052": "Ranrok's Loyalists are a menace. What can be done?",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10053": "Thank you for all that you've done for us.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10054": "My sincerest gratitude, you brave soul.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10055": "You've made Upper Hogsfield safer, and, for that, I thank you.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10056": "Thank you. Sincerely.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10057": "Yes – what about?",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10058": "I'm afraid not. He was last seen in his wool jumper, practising curses with Ashwinders near the Forest.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10059": "(sigh) Dear Dorothy. She'd go looking for Bardolph herself if she could.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10062": "I thought perhaps he'd get it out of his system and it would gradually stop. But then one day – he didn't come home.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10066": "Thank you. How kind. I'd be so grateful to learn where he is. I know in my heart he's out there. But do be careful.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10067": "Bardolph? What do you know of my brother?",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10068": "Oh – please tell me he's safe!",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10069": "Wh – what? No – no this can't be. He was seeking their advice. That's all.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10070": "What more could I have done? Oh, Bardolph.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10071": "What? B – but – how could you possibly think that an Inferius was my brother Bardolph? That's absurd!",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10072": "No – no, this can't be. ",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10074": "I should have done more. I shall never forgive myself.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10075": "Bardolph – you wouldn't have left without saying goodbye – would you?",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10079": "My brother Bardolph dared to stand up to them and ended up in St Mungo's.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10088": "I'm afraid not.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10089": "Despite my repeated warnings, Bardolph's been experimenting with Dark Magic near the edge of the Forest.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10093": "I'd be happy to speak with you. Especially after your help ridding us of Ranrok's Loyalists.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10094": "I did. My apologies. I've not been myself since we last met.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10095": "In their anger, they hurled him against a rock and robbed him. ",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10096": "Ranrok and his followers have set up camp here. No regard for our beloved hamlet or our livelihoods. Ruthless.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10097": "The moment he left St Mungo's, he vowed revenge. I worry he may be dabbling in magic that he will one day regret.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10100": "I can't believe he's never coming home.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10101": "No. We are standing firm. Once my brother returns, then we shall decide what to do next.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10102": "Ranrok and his followers have set up camp here. No regard for our beloved hamlet or our livelihoods. Ruthless.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10103": "It's Ranrok I have to thank for losing Bardolph. If only I could somehow rid our hamlet of these monsters.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10105": "Part of me wants to avenge the loss of my brother, whilst another part of me simply wants to hide.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10108": "I'm especially grateful. You did – for Bardolph – what I could not.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10109": "When my brother returns, this news will mean the world to him.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10110": "Upper Hogsfield is my home. Bardolph and I grew up here.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10111": "No. He'd never leave me here alone. He did speak of going to talk with Victor Rookwood.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10112": "Bardolph – where are you? I'll not give up hope.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10113": "Bardolph – an Ashwinder. Perhaps I will see him again.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10114": "I do appreciate what you went through to find my brother. Thank you.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10115": "We should not have to live in fear. This is our home.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10116": "I do miss the bustle of business. Poor customers, afraid to venture out.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10117": "I won't go near them.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10118": "He's gone to seek Victor Rookwood's advice. I didn't approve of that idea, but perhaps in the end it will help.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10120": "Hm – only his satchel, journal and a woollen jumper I knitted for him. That's all I can recall.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10121": "I do hope my brother is all right.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10122": "Bardolph. My dear, dear brother.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10123": "That worries me almost more than his attempts at mastering Dark Magic. Rookwood is as dangerous as Ranrok, in my opinion.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10124": "I fear for other hamlets. Truly. Ranrok and his lot are unlike any goblins I've ever seen.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10126": "What strange attire.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10127": "Oh, that's a Dark spell. Never use that.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10129": "Probably shouldn't do that again.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10130": "Welcome! Have a look around.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10131": "Oh, you'll like that. A fine choice.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10132": "Marvellous! I could always use more of these.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10133": "Oh, dear. Not enough money I'm afraid.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10134": "Thank you for passing through.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10135": "What are you looking for exactly?",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10136": "It's you! The good you've done on behalf of the Upper Hogsfield residents – I thank you.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10137": "I still can't believe that Bardolph has joined the Ashwinders. Can't see them bringing him any happiness.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10138": "Oh, hello. I can't get over what happened to Bardolph. My poor brother – an Inferius. Simply awful.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10139": "Pardon me. Didn't see you there.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10140": "Fair bit of noise you're making there.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10141": "That worries me almost more than his attempts at mastering Dark Magic.",
  "ClaireBeaumont_10142": "I do hope my brother is all right.",
  "ClementineWillardsey_10062": "Don't forget – the butterflies always seem to be on the fringes of the Forbidden Forest. Good luck.",
  "ClementineWillardsey_10063": "Well – what happened? Did you find them?",
  "ClementineWillardsey_10065": "Oh. Oh, I see. ",
  "ClementineWillardsey_10068": "Nonetheless, I'm grateful that you tried. It was very brave of you really. Well. Thank you. You take care, my friend.",
  "ClementineWillardsey_10073": "Thank you again for trying to follow 'my butterflies'. So sad not knowing where they go when the leave me.",
  "ClementineWillardsey_10075": "I couldn't be more thrilled that you earned yourself a reward following those butterflies. You deserve it.",
  "ClementineWillardsey_10087": "Of course. A swarm of beautiful butterflies has been drifting about the edge of the Forbidden Forest.",
  "ClementineWillardsey_10088": "I wondered if you might possibly follow them and let me know where they lead.",
  "ClementineWillardsey_10089": "Oh, please tell me you have an answer for me about the butterflies.",
  "ClementineWillardsey_10090": "(sigh) How lovely. Butterflies lifting an enchanted tree.",
  "ClementineWillardsey_10091": "Oh, hello! (laughs) Talking to myself. I'm Clementine – Willardsey. Charmed.",
  "ClementineWillardsey_10092": "When I was at Hogwarts, we truly were forbidden from entering the Forest –",
  "ClementineWillardsey_10093": "It's silly, but I'm insatiably curious as to where the butterflies go in the Forest. You – couldn't possibly find out, could you?",
  "ClementineWillardsey_10094": "I do! Yes! If you wouldn't mind.",
  "ClementineWillardsey_10095": "Oh, goodness. Everything from students being mysteriously beheaded to terrifying spider dens. ",
  "ClementineWillardsey_10096": "Trust me. You hear that at eleven years old – it sticks with you.",
  "ClementineWillardsey_10097": "Oh, how kind. Students these days have so much more courage than I ever did.",
  "ClementineWillardsey_10098": "I was musing on the precious butterflies I see near the edge of the Forest. Whenever I come near, they fly off into it.",
  "ClementineWillardsey_10099": "Oh, how lovely! I'm glad you were rewarded for your efforts.",
  "ClementineWillardsey_10100": "(sigh) Perhaps one day I'll be able to bring myself to go into the Forest.",
  "ClementineWillardsey_10101": "You can usually find me right around here. I hope to see you soon.",
  "ClementineWillardsey_10102": "I wonder where they go?",
  "ClementineWillardsey_10103": "I wish I had the courage to go into the Forest.",
  "ClementineWillardsey_10104": "– told horrible stories about it and I've had an irrationally intense fear of it ever since.",
  "ClementineWillardsey_10105": "For now, I'm happy simply knowing there's something so lovely to see, should I dare.",
  "CliffordCromwell_10016": "Hello there. How can I be of help?",
  "CliffordCromwell_10018": "I have all the time in the world for a potential customer. How do you do? I'm Cromwell, Clifford Cromwell.",
  "CliffordCromwell_10019": "However, I did see a poacher not too long ago. Not good for business. Not good at all.",
  "CliffordCromwell_10020": "You'll hear rumours of treasure in those same hills, but I've never seen it. Likely someone making up stories.",
  "CliffordCromwell_10021": "How charming! No one ever asks about me. Been in Marunweem since I left Hogwarts.",
  "CliffordCromwell_10022": "I sell plants and their byproducts here. Herbology was always my passion, even as a young Hufflepuff at Hogwarts.",
  "CliffordCromwell_10023": "Aside from the lake – which is always a delightful spot to unwind – we're happy simply to wander the nearby hills.",
  "CliffordCromwell_10024": "Try to avoid them when I can. Nasty lot, Rookwood's crew.",
  "CliffordCromwell_10027": "Of course! Lived here for years. Lovely, peaceful place to settle in.",
  "CliffordCromwell_10028": "I did some work with the Ministry as a young man. A confidential project.",
  "CliffordCromwell_10029": "But, after a time, I sought a quieter life. Set up shop here, selling my wares. I am always content among my plants.",
  "CliffordCromwell_10030": "Agreed. 'Just and loyal and unafraid of toil' are we. Based upon our brief chat alone, I sense that you do our house proud.",
  "CliffordCromwell_10031": "We are indeed. Glad to know our reputation still stands strong.",
  "CliffordCromwell_10032": "Had to do with the usage of Mandrakes – as weapons believe it or not. Went through enough cotton wool in my ears to fill a cauldron.",
  "CliffordCromwell_10033": "My my, is that what passes for proper attire these days?",
  "CliffordCromwell_10034": "I'll have none of that in my shop! Take that nonsense outside.",
  "CliffordCromwell_10037": "Merlin's beard!",
  "CliffordCromwell_10038": "Welcome, welcome. Come on in, don't be shy.",
  "CliffordCromwell_10039": "I hope this serves you well in all of your future Herbological ventures.",
  "CliffordCromwell_10040": "Such a pleasure doing business with you.",
  "CliffordCromwell_10041": "Oh dear, it appears that you don't have enough for that purchase.",
  "CliffordCromwell_10042": "Be sure to visit again. Always brightens my day helping you young ones.",
  "CliffordCromwell_10043": "Ah yes, what can I do for you?",
  "CliffordCromwell_10044": "Oh, hello there my young friend.",
  "CliffordCromwell_10045": "Goodness now, you gave me quite a start there.",
  "CliffordCromwell_10046": "I can look the other way. Had a few frustrations in my time too.",

  "CressidaBlume_10512": "Hmm. Always thought <i>Levioso</i> was for first-years. Not anymore.",
  "CressidaBlume_10514": "After my brother learned the Summoning Charm, it was constant '<i>Accio</i> this', '<i>Accio</i> that.' Cutlery flying everywhere. Quite unsafe, really.",
  "CressidaBlume_10517": "(sigh) Yes. Having a spot of trouble. I've mastered the charm using its incantation, but this is proving a bit trickier.",
  "CressidaBlume_10523": "I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. It's not a complicated spell. I should be able to do it non-verbally. Why is this not working? Urgh.",
  "CressidaBlume_10527": "Urgh – perhaps I should – hmm.",
  "CressidaBlume_10528": "Wait, that's not right? I really thought I had it.",
  "CressidaBlume_10529": "What did I do wrong this time?",
  "CressidaBlume_10530": "Still not working. Ugh.",
  "CressidaBlume_10531": "Oh dear. I shall get in trouble for this.",
  "CressidaBlume_10532": "I really have made a mess of things.",
  "CressidaBlume_10537": "But I must've confused the Latin word for 'feather' with 'bird' in my incantation, because when I opened my bag just now in the library they literally took flight.",
  "CressidaBlume_10538": "Amit told Madam Scribner they were my books flying around. So she said that if I caused her any more trouble she'd write to my parents.",
  "CressidaBlume_10540": "If you could collect them and bring them to me, I can remove the charm.",
  "CressidaBlume_10542": "Well, lesson learned. I certainly won't be practising any charms in the library again any time soon.",
  "CressidaBlume_10543": "Now to work out where I went wrong.",
  "CressidaBlume_10544": "I – my wandwork is fine, thank you. I can cast spells more complicated than this one without speaking.",
  "CressidaBlume_10545": "I practised all summer. I can cast spells more complicated than this one without speaking. What's so difficult about this one?",
  "CressidaBlume_10546": "Oh, I hope so. If I can get it, Professor Ronen's sure to be very impressed.",
  "CressidaBlume_10548": "I'm just going to keep at it.",
  "CressidaBlume_10549": "Oh, yes. And if you don't get it just right, the results can be, shall we say, awkward.",
  "CressidaBlume_10551": "You as well. Enjoy your first day.",
  "CressidaBlume_10552": "Once, I tried to cast <i>Depulso</i> nonverbally on a goblet in the Great Hall and ended up launching Professor Sharp's Yorkshire pudding into his face. He was not happy. ",
  "CressidaBlume_10554": "Oh, hello.  Thank you for asking. I'm Cressida, by the way, and I'm afraid everything's not all right. I may be in a spot of trouble with the librarian.",
  "CressidaBlume_10555": "Oh, hello. Nice to see you again. Thank you for asking – and I'm afraid everything's not all right. I may be in a spot of trouble with the librarian.",
  "CressidaBlume_10556": "I'd collect the books and remove the charm myself, except this isn't the first time one of my charms has threatened the peace of the library.",
  "CressidaBlume_10557": "Thank you. Somehow I don't think the librarian will see it that way.",
  "CressidaBlume_10559": "Possibly. But where's the fun in simplicity? New charms and spells have to come from someone, why not me?",
  "CressidaBlume_10560": "Perhaps you could get them for me? There are only five. She won't be suspicious of a new student looking around.",
  "CressidaBlume_10561": "I'd very much appreciate it. One of the books is my diary. I'd rather it not fall into the wrong hands.",
  "CressidaBlume_10563": "You see, I'm fond of creating my own charms. Thought I'd perfected my 'light as a feather' charm to use on my library books.",
  "CressidaBlume_10564": "I need someone to collect the five books flying about the library for me.",
  "CressidaBlume_10568": "Not at all. Hogwarts doesn't teach nonverbal casting until the sixth year. And even then many struggle with it.",
  "CressidaBlume_10569": "I'm simply trying to get ahead of the game.",
  "CressidaBlume_10570": "Oh, hello there! Welcome to Gryffindor. I'm Cressida.",
  "CressidaBlume_10571": "The Headmaster? I hope it's not about anything I've been doing.",
  "CressidaBlume_10572": "Oh no. It's the Headmaster and he's coming this way.",
  "CressidaBlume_10573": "Oh, Professor. This is an  interesting surprise. It's Blume, by the way.",
  "CressidaBlume_10574": "Something seems a little off with the Headmaster.",
  "CressidaBlume_10575": "Splendidly theatrical arrival to the Sorting Ceremony last evening. Made it in by the skin of your teeth.",
  "CressidaBlume_10576": "Is it true that you're Professor Fig's protégé?",
  "CressidaBlume_10577": "Blast. I was hoping he might've given you some advice on nonverbal casting.",
  "CressidaBlume_10578": "My arms get so tired carrying them around all day.",
  "CressidaBlume_10579": "Charms, sir. Nonverbal spells. Might work on one that makes me disappear.",
  "CressidaBlume_10580": "They're not invis – I mean, I've seen them about. I mean. Yes sir.",
  "CressidaBlume_10581": "Oh, what a relief! Thank you.",
  "CressidaBlume_10584": "I'll happily take the heavy lot off your hands now.",
  "CressidaBlume_10585": "Ugh! You're not at all who I thought you to be.",
  "CressidaBlume_10587": "Any luck finding my diary – and the rest of my books?",
  "CressidaBlume_10588": "Thank goodness some people are trustworthy. Certainly wouldn't want anyone but me reading my diary.",
  "CressidaBlume_10589": "Should never have trusted them.",
  "CressidaBlume_10591": "You might recall that I was trying to cast nonverbally when we met in the common room. Well, I mastered that –",
  "CressidaBlume_10592": "– and now I've taken to creating my own charms. Thought I'd perfected my 'light as a feather' charm to use on my library books.",
  "CressidaBlume_10593": "(sigh) To be perfectly honest, I don't think he meant any harm. I think he was impressed. Bragging on my behalf.",
  "CressidaBlume_10594": "Amit spends a lot of time gazing at the stars, but he knows a good charm when he sees one.",
  "CressidaBlume_10595": "One of them is my personal diary, and I'd really like to have it back before it falls in to the wrong hands.",
  "CressidaBlume_10596": "Fine. I shall pay you. But you cannot begin to imagine what I shall be writing about you next.",
  "CressidaBlume_10597": "They're not invisible, sir. I've seen them near the library – in fact, they helped me with my, er, heavy books.",
  "CressidaBlume_10598": "Well, they're as good as invisible to me, sir. Rotten little extortionist. Holding my diary hostage.",
  "CressidaBlume_10599": "Er, nothing, sir.",
  "CressidaBlume_10600": "Well, don't you take to a broom quickly? Most impressive.",
  "CressidaBlume_10601": "A Graphorn – allowing itself to be ridden? What sort of spell did you cast on that beast?",
  "CressidaBlume_10602": "Hippogriffs are such majestic beasts. Cannot imagine riding one.",
  "CressidaBlume_10603": "Seems an odd choice for wandering about outside your dormitory.",
  "CressidaBlume_10604": "Tragic about Professor Fig.",
  "CressidaBlume_10605": "Trolls? In the village? Never thought I'd need to worry about my safety whilst on a quick trip to the Three Broomsticks.",
  "CressidaBlume_10606": "I'm astonished that Ranrok was able to gain access anywhere near Hogwarts.",
  "CressidaBlume_10607": "You know that's a Dark spell, right?",
  "CressidaBlume_10608": "(sigh) One day I shall invent a spell as useful as <i>Alohomora</i>.",
  "CressidaBlume_10610": "That was nothing. You should see the charm I've been working on.",
  "CressidaBlume_10611": "I'm quite close to perfecting my 'light as a feather' charm. Not to worry, I'm practising it far from the library this time.",
  "CressidaBlume_10612": "Oh, dear. Pardon me.",
  "CressidaBlume_10613": "There must be a way to do that more quietly. Perhaps I could create a variation on a charm.",
  "CressidaBlume_10614": "Perhaps I should start with brushing up on my Latin.",
  "CrispinDunn_10001": "Please do. If you can think of anyone that may be brave enough to help, I'd appreciate it. Thank you!",
  "CrispinDunn_10004": "I'm concerned about my customers, of course, but it appears that most of the hamlet's residents fled to safety.",
  "CrispinDunn_10005": "They've trapped the entire hamlet in webs. I was lucky to escape at all.",
  "CrispinDunn_10007": "Those infernal beasts overran the town and turned it into a palace of webs. I'm frantic with worry over my friend, Mary.",
  "CrispinDunn_10008": "The hamlet of Aranshire belongs to the spiders now.",
  "CrispinDunn_10011": "Oh, those miserable crawling creatures. I couldn't stop them.",
  "CrispinDunn_10014": "If not for you, my business and my life would be in shambles.",
  "CrispinDunn_10015": "Perhaps you've heard – my friends and I have started calling you the 'Spider Slayer.'",
  "CrispinDunn_10017": "Those spiders certainly met their match with you.",
  "CrispinDunn_10023": "I imagine the first order of business will be to help the hamlet rebuild. I suppose I have nothing to fear from dead spiders.",
  "CrispinDunn_10028": "Just barely. But I don't want to trouble a student with my woes.",
  "CrispinDunn_10030": "I'm not so sure. Name's Crispin Dunne, by the way. I trade in the surrounding hamlets. Do the most business in Aranshire.",
  "CrispinDunn_10052": "Oh, I do hope Mary and her neighbours aren't harmed.",
  "CrispinDunn_10056": "I did. Reached out to anyone who would listen. Tried Minister 'Spout-Hole' Spavin himself.",
  "CrispinDunn_10063": "Thank Merlin. About my sweet friend, Mary?",
  "CrispinDunn_10064": "Poor Mary. Fighting for the hamlet to the bitter end, no doubt. A noble sacrifice.",
  "CrispinDunn_10066": "Oh, Mary! What untoward scheme were you involved in?",
  "CrispinDunn_10071": "She didn't deserve this. Few do.",
  "CrispinDunn_10076": "Actually, before I go on, I should ask: are you afraid of spiders?",
  "CrispinDunn_10077": "You may not like what I have to say next. The hamlet's overrun with the vile things! And they're acting abnormally aggressively.",
  "CrispinDunn_10078": "Lucky you. The hamlet's overrun with the vile things! And they're acting abnormally aggressively.",
  "CrispinDunn_10080": "Lucky you. Sounds as though you've been able to overcome your fears to a degree.",
  "CrispinDunn_10089": "I would. But I have a crippling fear of the eight-legged beasts, which I – unlike you – seem incapable of conquering.",
  "CrispinDunn_10095": "If she needed financial assistance she could have just come to me.",
  "CrispinDunn_10096": "She truly was a remarkable woman. Remarkable.",
  "CrispinDunn_10099": "When I was a small child, I was being tormented and chased by a group of local bullies and slid into the hollow of a tree to hide.",
  "CrispinDunn_10100": "Within moments, spiders were crawling over every inch of my body. Seemed I'd stumbled on a nest.",
  "CrispinDunn_10102": "To dearly departed Mary.",
  "CrispinDunn_10104": "I honestly don't know. I've never seen so many spiders in all of my life. It's almost as if someone's breeding them.",
  "CrispinDunn_10105": "But, evidently they have their hands full with who knows what else. It seems this little hamlet has to fend for itself.",
  "CrispinDunn_10106": "I was there for what seemed hours. I can feel their legs on me now, just talking about it. ",
  "CrispinDunn_10107": "Lovely little hamlet. Stunning gardens. Just the other day the <i>Daily Prophet</i> ran an article on its scenic hedgerows.",
  "CrispinDunn_10108": "I don't know what to do. Can you think of anyone who could help Mary?",
  "CrispinDunn_10109": "I couldn't move – paralysed by fear of the spiders and an equally profound fear of the wizards I knew were just outside the tree.",
  "CrispinDunn_10111": "Thank you again for all you've done. I shall keep you apprised of the hamlet's – rebuilding.",
  "CrispinDunn_10112": "It's my friend Mary I worry about. I haven't heard from her and I fear she's trapped in her cottage.",
  "CrispinDunn_10113": "Mary always has a way with these beasts. It's very concerning not to hear from her.",
  "CrispinDunn_10117": "I still can't get over losing poor, innocent Mary to those hideous spiders. She didn't deserve that.",
  "CrispinDunn_10118": "Poor Mary. A victim of her own greed. No matter what, she didn't deserve to be killed by her spiders. You think you know people.",
  "CrispinDunn_10119": "You? You cleared out the spiders? I can't believe it, but I'm certainly relieved.",
  "CrispinDunn_10120": "They'll find Aranshire southeast of Hogsmeade, just below the train station.",
  "CrispinDunn_10121": "I was hoping someone could check on her for me.",
  "CrispinDunn_10122": "Not very appropriate attire.",
  "CrispinDunn_10123": "Didn't Clementine Willardsey ask you to follow those butterflies into the Forbidden Forest for her? Not the bravest person, that Clementine.",
  "CrispinDunn_10124": "That's not a spell you should be using. And I'm sure you know that.",
  "CrispinDunn_10126": "You nearly got me.",
  "CrispinDunn_10127": "You're the one who took care of that awful Acromantula near Aranshire, aren't you? Fine bit of work, that!",
  "CrispinDunn_10128": "Ah, welcome! Nice to see you.",
  "CrispinDunn_10129": "A fine choice, indeed.",
  "CrispinDunn_10130": "Nice doing business with you.",
  "CrispinDunn_10131": "You're a bit short on funds, I'm afraid.",
  "CrispinDunn_10132": "Thank you for stopping in. Be sure to visit us again soon.",
  "CrispinDunn_10133": "What sort of thing are we looking for?",
  "CrispinDunn_10134": "Oh, dear. Pardon me.",
  "CrispinDunn_10135": "Got rid of that, didn't you?",
  "CuthbertBinns_10436": "– But students are always asking me, 'Professor Binns, what was the most exciting thing to ever occur in history?'",
  "CuthbertBinns_10466": "In today's lesson we will cover a truly thrilling event:",
  "CuthbertBinns_10467": "The Goblin Rebellion of 1752, and all of its triumph and tragedy.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10468": "But more specifically, we will address the devastating effect it had on the wizard milling industry.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10469": "Throughout the many goblin battles, countless wizard cloaks were lost.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10470": "Actually we do know the number. Six hundred and thirty-two.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10471": "The disruption of manufacturing had a ripple effect upon other industries as well.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10472": "Comprehension of this fact is crucial to the young wizarding pupil.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10473": "Moreso than studying the acts of chivalry of the so-called gallants of yore.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10475": "Curious students can find him on display here in the Bell Tower Entrance Hall. I recommend that all students introduce themselves to this 'Hero of Hogwarts.'",
  "CuthbertBinns_10476": "Grimbald Weft was responsible for some of the most important work done in the Goblin Rebellion of 1752 –",
  "CuthbertBinns_10477": "Without his quick hand and deft needlework, countless witches and wizards may have caught cold during the late spring of that year.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10484": "But 'history occurs outside the classroom'.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10485": "And look, it's time for my constitutional. One can practically osmose the history flowing through Hogwarts.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10487": "He never strays from the Bell Tower Entrance Hall. Yes, students with a thirst for knowledge would do well to seek him out.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10488": "Standing in eternal but symbolic watch over the Bell Tower is a retinue of loyal knights. Or rather, statues of knights, I should clarify.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10489": "Keen-eyed students will spot the statue of Sir Affpuddle of the Cheerful Countenance nestled among the ranks.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10490": "His fame was not won by vanquishing foes in single combat, nor by slaying bloodthirsty dragons, but rather in training yards and sculleries –",
  "CuthbertBinns_10491": "– where his warm and approachable demeanour was celebrated by old friends and newcomers alike.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10492": "I encourage everyone to make the waving statue's acquaintance.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10506": "The Hogwarts founders could never have achieved such architectural majesty without the aid of powerful magic.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10507": "Hogwarts is impervious to the inexorable march of time. Perhaps that is why I admire it so.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10509": "In all the centuries that Hogwarts has existed, not once has it collapsed.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10510": "There's nothing quite so magical as history. Dusty, immutable history.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10511": "Students often complain about the many staircases at Hogwarts, but they never bother me.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10512": "As one would expect, Hogwarts contains no narthexes since obviously those would not be found in castles.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10514": "Ah, yes. I see you found Grimbald Weft.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10515": "The thrill of the scholarly pursuit. I know the feeling quite well.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10525": "The wise student – such as yourself – will learn from it.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10526": "History is written by those who do their schoolwork, so they say.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10532": "And now for a stroll to the Bell Tower Entrance Hall.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10533": "Along with the rest of the castle, it was completed in the late Early Middle Ages.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10534": "The hall and the Bell Towers that loom above it contain myriad interesting artefacts.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10541": "He is well-known as the knight who waves to students.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10547": "– such as sewing buttons on witches' and wizards' coats.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10548": "Ah yes, Grimbald Weft. Quick with a needle and thread, that one.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10549": "He's a fascinating artefact of the Goblin Rebellion of 1752.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10550": "Ah, yes, Sir Affpuddle. Or rather, the statue of Sir Affpuddle.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10551": "It can be found amongst the other statues of knights. It's easy to identify, as it's been enchanted to wave at those who take the time to seek it out.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10685": "At any rate, he can be found nearby, perched in his case.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10689": "He's also nearby. See what you can learn from him for your next assignment.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10695": "Or at least I like to say that.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10696": "Well, of course he's just a skull. Everyone knows Grimbald Weft died of dragon pox in 1753.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10854": "Hmm. History does tend to repeat. It is a series of patterns – a thought both comforting and disconcerting.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10880": "Good to see you again. Recovered from that nasty bout of dragon pox, have we?",
  "CuthbertBinns_10881": "Are you? Well then. Welcome.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10884": "No doubt you're eagerly anticipating my analysis of various wizarding councils, codes, statutes and, of course,  goblin rebellions.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10885": "Not all goblins are rebellious. Some venture into wizarding politics, such as Eargit the Ugly; some are talented artisans, such as Bragbor the Boastful.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10886": "Mmm. Well-known for his metalwork. I would imagine much of his goblin-wrought iron and silver has survived to this very day.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10887": "Now, let's turn our attention to the agreeability and general good nature of Sir Affpuddle.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10888": "Back to our class topic for today: Grimbald Weft – another notable historical figure. He's right nearby.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10895": "Now class –",
  "CuthbertBinns_10897": "Well done. Alas, Sir Affpuddle's affability was his undoing. Died instantly trying to befriend a Basilisk. Eye contact is not always to be encouraged.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10899": "Of course, that did not bode well with the rest of the goblins, most of whom could not abide mourning the loss of a wizard.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10900": "True. But imagine how dull my lectures would be without goblin rebellions to discuss.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10901": "Yes, well, 'it takes a cauldron to raise a Chizpurfle,' as they say.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10903": "So beloved was he that even some goblins mourned his passing.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10912": "Where were we? Oh. Yes.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10914": "One of our own – a member of the Hogwarts faculty – was a reluctant hero of the Goblin Rebellion of 1752. Grimbald Weft.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10915": "You may smirk, but his actions made a significant difference.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10955": "I do hope it's not becoming fashionable to wear one's nightclothes in public.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10959": "Professor Fig's Magical Theory class may appeal to some, but I find facts to be the most useful content to master.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10960": "Who's going to teach Professor Fig's class now that he's gone? Not I.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10961": "Historically speaking, it is rare for trolls to attack wizarding villages out of nowhere.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10962": "If Hogwarts can withstand a rebellion led by Ranrok, I daresay it can withstand an assault of any kind.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10963": "That reference book you have seems a handy resource.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10964": "Is that a draught I feel?",
  "CuthbertBinns_10965": "It looks as if the sapling uprooted the mighty oak. In this metaphor you are the sapling and Ranrok is the oak.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10966": "Hmm? Did someone say something?",
  "CuthbertBinns_10984": "I beg your pardon.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10985": "Hm. How may I help you?",
  "CuthbertBinns_10986": "Ah, certainly. Their history is part of our history. In fact, you can trace most goblin rebellions to wizard intervention.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10987": "More specifically, the laws governing wands and who may legally possess them.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10990": "Two months into Flack's tenure, bad went to worse when the werewolves allied with the goblins.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10991": "Quite smartly, Flack resigned rather than deal with their combined forces.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10992": "Minister Flack was succeeded by one Hesphaestus Gore, who quickly quashed the dual uprisings with his signature brutality.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10993": "It is worth noting that many historians believe this punitive response led to even more werewolf conflict.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10994": "Another rebellion in 1752, the rebellion was so badly mishandled that Minister for Magic Albert Boot was forced to resign.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10995": "The Goblin Rebellion of 1612, for example, arose from goblin frustration over lack of representation on the Wizengamot.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10996": "It became a terrible, blood-soaked affair.  Take heart, though. Our current peace and prosperity shows that violence can be transitory.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10997": "He had been dunked in a pond publicly by a group of young wizards, if you can imagine that.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10998": "That being said, his replacement, one Basil Flack, lasted mere weeks. Best sort of vindication, if you ask my opinion.",
  "CuthbertBinns_10999": "Hm? Ah, yes. Of course.",
  "CuthbertBinns_11000": "Of course.",
  "CuthbertBinns_11001": "You have noted all of this, have you not?",
  "CuthbertBinns_11002": "Continue?  I take it your thirst for knowledge has yet to be quenched?",
  "CuthbertBinns_11004": "Very well. I shall be here should you need further instruction.",
  "CuthbertBinns_11005": "I rarely find an audience, captive or otherwise, eager to engage in such historical minutia.",
  "CuthbertBinns_11006": "Of course.",
  "CuthbertBinns_11009": "My sincere pleasure. Hmph. Now, I do believe I should be preparing for my next class. Good day to you.",
  "CuthbertBinns_11011": "If I'm not mistaken, and I rarely am, one of the eighteenth century's rebellions was led by Urg the Unclean.",
  "CuthbertBinns_11012": "Mmm. Well known for his metalwork. I would imagine much of his goblin-wrought iron and silver has survived to this very day.",
  "CuthbertBinns_11013": "Hmm. What? Yes.",
  "DaisyAbril_10035": "No! I'm worried sick about Isko, but he'd never want me to compromise my integrity. I also know that he's extremely clever.",
  "DaisyAbril_10037": "What else could it possibly mean? Besides, I came home to find that someone had trampled the daisies in our garden.",
  "DaisyAbril_10040": "I shall tell you what I can.",
  "DaisyAbril_10041": "We both are.",
  "DaisyAbril_10043": "He's resting at the moment, but seems to be in good spirits.",
  "DaisyAbril_10044": "Yes. I will. Lesson learned.",
  "DaisyAbril_10048": "Promise me you'll stay safe. Your bravery is to be admired, but taking unnecessary risks, well, –",
  "DaisyAbril_10052": "It may sound silly, but those were Isko's pride and joy. He would never have let that happen.",
  "DaisyAbril_10056": "Yes, I believe you can. Thank you again. For everything.",
  "DaisyAbril_10057": "I'm the one in the bank on a daily basis – which, evidently, makes me an enticing target for blackmail.",
  "DaisyAbril_10062": "I'm a security guard at Gringotts, and my husband is a curse-breaker for them.",
  "DaisyAbril_10063": "Of course I declined. Repeatedly. I thought they'd given up. Until I came home one night and found my husband gone – and a note affixed to my door with a knife.",
  "DaisyAbril_10065": "The note stated that I only had a few days to reconsider 'helping' with some 'banking needs' – and that my husband would 'appreciate it' if I acted quickly.",
  "DaisyAbril_10069": "That said, I was hoping he would have escaped by now. It makes me concerned as to – why he hasn't.",
  "DaisyAbril_10070": "If I'd known what you were planning – well, let's just say I'm desperately glad you're all right. Rookwood's criminals aren't to be trifled with.",
  "DaisyAbril_10071": "Harlow approached me about helping him extort my colleagues into giving him treasures from the vaults.",
  "DaisyAbril_10074": "Isko's job is even more removed from the vaults than mine. He travels the world for the bank. He could do nothing for Harlow.",
  "DaisyAbril_10075": "Oh, Isko. What have I done?",
  "DaisyAbril_10077": "Poor Johanna and little Archie. And now Harlow has taken my darling Isko!",
  "DaisyAbril_10079": "But the help Harlow wants is help that I cannot give. And my dearest Isko is paying the price.",
  "DaisyAbril_10081": "Mr Bickle was trying to help us, but now he's gone – I don't know what to do!",
  "DaisyAbril_10082": "Thank you. I hope it's not too late.",
  "DaisyAbril_10084": "Very well. Here's the note I received. You must be careful as well. Please don't put yourself in danger.",
  "DaisyAbril_10085": "It's you! Oh, I can't thank you enough for rescuing my dear Isko. He often speaks of the bravery you showed. You have my undying gratitude.",
  "DaisyAbril_10086": "I ought to get myself a broom like that. Something to consider.",
  "DaisyAbril_10087": "They let students ride on Graphorns now? Times have certainly changed.",
  "DaisyAbril_10088": "Riding Hippogriffs? Good way to get yourself injured – or worse.",
  "DaisyAbril_10089": "What are you wearing? Are those your night clothes?  Interesting choice.",
  "DaisyAbril_10090": "Trolls? In Hogsmeade? Never thought I'd see the day.",
  "DaisyAbril_10091": "We can all breathe easier with Ranrok out of the way.",
  "DaisyAbril_10092": "Harlow deserves to rot in Azkaban after what he did to my husband and I. Miserable creature.",
  "DaisyAbril_10093": "Who would have thought that butterflies, of all things, would lead someone to treasure?",
  "DaisyAbril_10094": "Oh, dear. Was that what I thought it was? Shouldn't be using that sort of spell.",
  "DaisyAbril_10095": "I trust you're only practising with that spell.",
  "DaisyAbril_10097": "Careful. Wouldn't want anyone getting hurt, would we?",
  "DaisyAbril_10098": "Oh, beg your pardon. Didn't see you there.",
  "DaisyAbril_10099": "Er – quite the noise you're making there.",

  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10688": "Why's it moving?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10689": "Your bag. It's wriggling. What you got in there? Not rats, I hope.",

  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10691": "You was robbed by a Niffler?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10692": "Go on, then – show him to me.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10693": "If you're wasting my time – ow!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10694": "He's scratched me! Your little rat's scratched me! What poacher can't even keep a hold of a rat?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10695": "If I ever catch your rat, it's dead! You hear me? Dead! Get out of here.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10696": "Amateur.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10697": "You're in well with them though, aren't you. In a short time, too.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10698": "Hmph. Must be nice. More than a pile of mash, I'd say.  More like, getting the easy business.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10699": "Worked nine years, I did, to be given Muggle festivals. You're here five minutes and they've got you at every Muggle fair going.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10700": "Sprouts? I don't like sprouts. Pudding's what I like. And only what's to be had at Steepley's.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10701": "Custard creams? That's exactly the muck I'm talking about. About every Squib I ever met likes those.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10702": "You're not one of them, are you?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10703": "A Squib. 'Cause if you are, I'll let them know, I will. All of them. Not having one of your kind running with us.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10705": "Well, well, well. The truth comes out.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10706": "I know. Your Unlocking Charm's lucky if it can open a conversation, but you're no Squib.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10707": "None of that Muggle tripe they force down your throat in London.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10720": "We certain there's a phoenix here? I've not seen a trace. You don't think phoenixes can turn to rocks, do you?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10723": "We'd have left weeks ago if it wasn't for Selwyn. Nothing left to steal around here anymore.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10724": "Should have stayed at the castle.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10729": "I always had a talent for the Dark Arts. Made all my Professors nervous in school.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10730": "No one can cast a Blasting Curse like I can.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10731": "I could have been top of my class if my Professors weren't so afraid of me.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10732": "They don't teach students to duel like they used to.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10733": "How did you manage to get your hands on Veritaserum?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10734": "Got something to hide? Worried she'll use the Veritaserum on you?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10735": "You were always a brilliant potioneer.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10736": "Do you know what they do to prisoners in Azkaban?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10737": "How can they allow people to be trapped with Dementors?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10738": "Diggory got a cemetery built on the island – as if that's enough justice for all those that died in those conditions.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10739": "My cousin got the Dementor's Kiss. Poor lad.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10740": "The Unforgivables haven't even been outlawed for two hundred years.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10741": "My sister tried to cast <i>Crucio</i> once on me, but she couldn't do it. Didn't work.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10742": "My cousin was given a life sentence in Azkaban for using Imperius – allegedly.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10743": "What about Unspeakables? Don't you find it strange that no one knows what they actually do?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10744": "Seems every career is connected to the Ministry in some way.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10745": "I'm learning how to create an Inferius. Complicated process, but certain to be useful.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10746": "I could use an Inferius for anything – they could fight anyone who annoys me, for example.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10747": "Creating an Inferius is a long process. I've failed a few times now, but I think I'm close.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10748": "No one will dare challenge me again once I have an Inferius at my beck and call.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10749": "The Ministry should round-up all the so-called Muggle-borns and demand to know where they got their magic.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10750": "Filthy Mudbloods shouldn't be allowed to associate with the rest of us decent folk.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10751": "I can smell a Mudblood from a mile away.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10753": "Trespasser! You're going straight in the dragon pit!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10754": "Oi! Who told you about this place?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10755": "Likely nothing. Who'd be foolish enough to creep about in here?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10756": "Could've been anything – loud as it is in here.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10757": "Who is that? Someone there?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10758": "If you're not one of us, you shouldn't be here – and you're about to find out why.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10759": "I heard something. Where did that sound come from?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10760": "A trespasser! I knew it!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10761": "You shouldn't be here.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10762": "I knew I heard something!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10763": "My mind's playing tricks on me.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10764": "Not surprised. No one would dare come in here.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10765": "Hm. I was sure I was about to find someone.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10766": "Poked your nose in the wrong tent!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10767": "Look around! You're outnumbered!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10768": "Treasure must be around here somewhere.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10769": "You won't escape again, coward!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10770": "Good riddance.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10771": "Course he did. Why else would he have run?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10772": "Harlow will decide what to do with him once he gets back.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10773": "Wha – ?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10774": "Let's play, shall we?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10776": "The boy won't escape from down there. We needn't trouble ourselves with him anymore.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10777": "Just what we needed. An annoying little brat to look after.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10778": "I worry we only confiscated his wand. What happened to the girl's?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10780": "I couldn't wait to get out of Hogwarts while I was there. I always had detention for something.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10781": "There must be some students at Hogwarts that we could recruit.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10782": "They teach the Dark Arts at other schools. Hogwarts should do the same.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10783": "Wonder which village would be best to target next.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10784": "He better notice, is all I can say. I'm better than the lot of them put together and it's time Rookwood saw it.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10785": "Children should know their place.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10786": "You should have known better.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10787": "You were no match for me.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10788": "Silly child.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10789": "You should have stayed in school.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10790": "Mistake to take me on.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10791": "Brr – My eyes – Brr, I can't – blink – Brr.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10792": "I can't feel my fingers.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10793": "I'm not one for the cold!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10794": "I never liked Herbology.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10797": "Frozen with fear, eh?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10798": "Let's see you get out of this one!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10799": "Hope you're not afraid of heights.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10800": "How's the view?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10801": "Shall I put you down now? Hm, perhaps in a bit.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10802": "Ha! Nice try.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10803": "Is that the best you can do?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10804": "So close!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10805": "I wager that one hurt!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10806": "How did that feel?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10810": "Barely even felt that.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10811": "Your spells are weak!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10816": "Rookwood is going to like hearing of this: your demise at my hands!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10817": "Somebody's been paying attention in Herbology.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10818": "You're going to fight me with plants?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10819": "We should never have trusted the goblins.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10820": "You deserved that.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10821": "How dare you turn against me!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10822": "I knew it was foolish to trust you!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10823": "I knew you'd turn on us eventually.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10824": "It was a mistake to fight alongside you.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10825": "It was only a matter of time before one of Ranrok's Loyalists betrayed us.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10826": "Get that Mandrake!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10827": "It's a Mandrake!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10828": "It's so loud!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10829": "Make it stop!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10834": "Come on and face me.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10835": "Do your worst.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10836": "It'll be my pleasure to defeat you.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10837": "Let's see what you can do.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10838": "Just hold still, will you?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10839": "Stop doing that!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10840": "Stop moving!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10841": "You can't elude my spells forever.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10842": "Aargh!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10843": "Ahh! Stop!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10844": "I fight Graphorns – I'm sure I can handle you.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10845": "Think you're stronger than me?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10846": "You'll never get the better of me.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10847": "My wand!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10848": "Oh!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10849": "Trying to disarm me?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10850": "Ahh!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10851": "I'm going to be sick!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10852": "No no no!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10853": "Aaah – aaaahh!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10855": "I've always hated Herbology.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10856": "Stupid plant.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10857": "I had no choice.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10858": "I had to stop you.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10859": "They turned you against us.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10860": "You'll pay for making me do that!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10861": "Not having a good day?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10862": "Quiet down.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10863": "Watch yourself.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10864": "Watch out!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10865": "Almost got me!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10866": "Riding a Graphorn? Now I've seen everything.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10867": "There! On the Graphorn!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10868": "Look out!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10869": "Look! On the Hippogriff!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10870": "Don't play with magic you don't understand.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10871": "I doubt you learned that in school.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10872": "That's a dangerous spell for a child.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10873": "You want to fight?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10874": "Save some for the rest of us.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10875": "You're not as innocent as you look.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10876": "You've got a bright future ahead of you.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10880": "I'd think twice before doing that again.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10881": "Looking to make a new friend? I'll be happy to oblige.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10882": "That wand of yours will be the death of you!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10883": "Well, 'see someone has little value for their own life.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10884": "Can't you see you're being controlled?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10885": "Pull yourself together!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10886": "You're not yourself!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10887": "Somebody enjoys Herbology class.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10888": "What plants will you enlist this time?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10889": "Somebody paid attention in Defense Against the Dark Arts class.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10890": "You think you're so clever, don't you?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10891": "Going to use your special magic again?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10892": "You think you're safe with that special magic, but you're not.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10893": "A student who isn't afraid to use the Dark Arts. How interesting.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10894": "You'll never be able to defeat all of the Ashwinders.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10895": "You'll never best us all.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10896": "I'm a lot tougher than a troll – you'll see.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10897": "You'll pay for what you did to Harlow!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10898": "You're the one who defeated Harlow!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10899": "That's the student who stole our Hippogriff!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10900": "Oy! You nicked our Hippogriff.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10901": "You took that goblin helm!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10902": "You're the one who stole the goblin helm!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10903": "I will avenge Iona Morgan.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10904": "You must answer for what you did to Iona Morgan.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10905": "You ruined our dragon fights!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10906": "You think you can release our dragon and get away with it?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10907": "It's the student who released Treadwell!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10908": "You took Nora Treadwell from us!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10909": "We would have had those Snidgets if it wasn't for you!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10910": "Ah, if it isn't the Snidget's best friend.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10913": "This is for Rookwood!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10914": "Never cross an Ashwinder.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10915": "You've underestimated the Ashwinders.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10916": "One less goblin to worry about.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10917": "These goblins are no better than the beasts we capture.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10923": "Shocking, eh?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10924": "Let's see you evade this.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10925": "You can't stop lightning!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10926": "Bad weather we're having.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10927": "Careful not to get bit.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleA_10928": "My bite is worse than my bark.",

  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10699": "Perhaps I'd be a better fit with the Poacher Pack. I always had a talent with Beasts.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10700": "I used to invent my own spells when I was in school.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10701": "How many witches and wizards do you know talented enough to create their own spells?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10702": "I brewed this Veritaserum myself.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10703": "I'm sure this Truth Potion will come in handy.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10704": "Potions always came easy to me – even difficult ones like Veritaserum.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10705": "Eldritch Diggory thought he could fix Azkaban. Pfft, what a joke.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10706": "The Ministry doesn't care about anyone except the well-to-do.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10707": "We should put Spout-hole Spavin and all those loyal to him in Azkaban. See how long they last.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10708": "What do you think Dementors look like under that veil?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10709": "The Ministry can't stop me from using any spell I'd like.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10710": "I'd like to see an Auror try to arrest me. Soon show them what I'm made of.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10711": "I'd love to 'Imperius' Spout-hole Spavin – make him legalise the Unforgivables.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10712": "My mum wanted me to be a nurse at St Mungo's – follow in her footsteps.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10713": "Do you think the Ashwinders would take me?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10714": "Necromancy is extremely complicated magic.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10715": "If the Necromancer dies, do the Inferi die as well? These are the questions that keep me up at night.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10716": "Necromancy is the one branch of the Dark Arts I don't dare venture into.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10717": "Can Inferi speak?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10718": "Have you ever heard of a Mudblood being sorted into Slytherin? Surely that could never happen?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10719": "I thought that headmaster would ensure there'd be no Mudbloods at Hogwarts, but it seems he's too spineless to stand up to the Ministry.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10720": "Black promised there'd be changes at Hogwarts for pure-bloods like us.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10724": "Who's there?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10725": "What was that?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10726": "That had better be an Ashwinder.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10727": "This is my patrol. Who's that?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10728": "I know you're in here now.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10729": "Not very clever, are you?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10730": "Caught you!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10731": "Trying to outsmart the Ashwinders, are we?",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10732": "Hm. Could have sworn I heard something.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10733": "Don't know what to make of that.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10734": "Nothing here. Seems I was wrong.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10738": "Meddlesome child!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10739": "You'll have to try harder than that!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10740": "Run off. Fine by me.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10741": "Back for more, I see!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10742": "Knew I'd find you!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10743": "Hmph. Can't trust my own ears.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10744": "Ha! Time to teach someone a lesson.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10745": "This guard duty's not for me. Waste of time hanging about an old castle.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10749": "I hope they locked him in the furthest depths of that tent. I don't want to have to deal with him.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10750": "Send him home, kill him – I don't care what you do, but don't leave us to deal with him. This is Harlow's mess.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10752": "It might.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10753": "Harlow says her friend'll be reckless enough. He wants them alive.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10754": "Just keep an eye out!",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10755": "Be on the lookout for the girl's friend. If they're daft enough to try to come through here.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10756": "You. You're the one we're looking for.  And you brought a friend.",
  "DarkWizardFemaleB_10757": "Oh, I'm going to enjoy this.",

  "DarkWizardMaleA_10093": "You can do better than that!",

  "DarkWizardMaleA_10204": "You didn't see that coming!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10205": "Oh, I'm sorry. A smite painful?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10206": "Don't wear yourself out.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10207": "Need a rest?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10208": "Whoops.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10209": "How does that feel?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10210": "I hope you know Aguamenti.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10211": "Oh, bravo!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10212": "Ooh! You're going to need a bit of dittany for that.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10213": "I haven't had this much fun in years.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10218": "You're no match for me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10219": "You have no idea what you're getting yourself into.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10220": "You're making a terrible mistake.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10221": "Let's get this over with.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10222": "You don't know when to knock it on the head, do you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10223": "Having some difficulty over there?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10224": "You are truly wasting my time.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10225": "How was that? A bit of fun?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10226": "Well, keep going. This is entertaining.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10227": "Are you all right?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10228": "Don't strain yourself too much.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10443": "I know it's here. I know it!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10444": "This is very special what we're looking for – special indeed.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10445": "Keep a keen eye out. There could be traps.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10446": "Tread carefully – better to move slowly than be lost to haste.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10447": "Look around with a keen eye. The entrance must be near.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10448": "Pay close attention – we're looking for a location that likely won't be obvious.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10449": "I've never seen such a look of fear in your eyes. Eh? I should think an ant'd show more mettle.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10450": "Brave? (laughing) I'd say we know who to leave at home minding the oven.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10451": "You're wasting your time with her, my friend. I've seen her show more affection to a Horklump.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10453": "When you have a cloak like that who can blame a girl for swooning?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10454": "I was a proud man that day, and there's more of those days ahead.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10455": "It's been a bit grim, I won't deny, but the tides'll turn for us soon.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10456": "Nuisance when supplies run low though. Always makes me nervous when our stocks aren't brimming.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10457": "That was a good haul. It's always a pleasant surprise when, well – when there are no surprises.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10458": "Well, if you weren't so forgetful we'd probably have more, wouldn't we. Can never have too many sacks, my friend.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10459": "The fog blighted us a bit, I'll agree. Nonetheless, we have good spoils for our efforts, and so should we hold our heads.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10460": "Yes, there've been mistakes, but I can't complain. If I'm to think on it, we've seen far worse in our years.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10462": "Has your brain been infested with Bundimuns? A manoeuvre like that could've got us killed!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10465": "Likely we'll need more wood if we're to not freeze. Seems harshness has her mind set to follow us.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10466": "I'd remember my father speak of these times. Seems now they're upon me they tell quite a different story.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10467": "And be sure to stoke the flames with an easy hand. I seem to recall last time you put the thing out.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10468": "One wonders if one's life is indeed carved out by destiny, or merely the spawn of ill choices made along the way.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10487": "Where did you go, coward?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10488": "Afraid to face me?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10489": "Hmph – seems this one slipped away –",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10490": "Skulking off only further stokes my fury – fool.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10491": "Aha! Back for more!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10492": "Ha! You're easier to spot than an Erumpent!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10510": "I shall cast my eyes closer – best to be sure.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10511": "What's that? Better have a look, then.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10582": "We taught you better than that!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10596": "That's no way to greet old friends.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10598": "We've made our money. Now let's burn him and be done with it!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10603": "Can't believe Harlow showed up here. Something about him makes me nervous – breathing down our necks.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10606": "Try not to make this too easy for me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10607": "I'll make you will wish you were back at a school.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10608": "What's this? A child wandered too far from home?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10609": "No more happy days for you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10612": "You're starting to bore me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10613": "This fight stops here!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10614": "Feeling helpless?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10615": "Not so confident now, eh?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10618": "You're nothing but kindling!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10619": "Fancy some flames?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10620": "Too hot for your taste?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10621": "Novice luck.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10622": "I'm not done with you!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10623": "Ha! Nice try.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10624": "Is that all?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10625": "Poor attempt!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10626": "You made a mistake coming here!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10627": "Aha! I see you!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10628": "Who goes there?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10629": "Your bite is no match for my magic.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10630": "Your barking days are over.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10631": "Deadly mistake coming here – the both of you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10632": "You two were fools to come here.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10633": "You've both stumbled into your own grave.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10634": "Ha! Another pitiful beast caught in my trap.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10635": "Ah! How delightful!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10636": "As you wish.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10637": "It's time to even the odds.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10638": "That was a mistake.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10639": "A drunken house-elf casts better magic.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10640": "You'll answer to me for that.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10641": "Gah! Filthy vegetables!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10642": "Ha! A Mooncalf has more bite!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10643": "Is that all?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10644": "Is this Hogwarts' best? Hahaha",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10649": "What's this? Got your garden fighting for you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10650": "I always hated these weeds!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10653": "Can't stand the sight of such a rotten beast!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10654": "This'll be the last day of your nasty little life!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10655": "What have you done? Little git, I shall end you!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10656": "Huh – you manipulated me. You'll answer for this!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10657": "Back to the filth where you belong.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10658": "What a nasty excuse for a beast.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10659": "And they think themselves a match for wizardkind.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10660": "Know your place, goblin.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10661": "And stay dead.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10662": "They just never know when to quit.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10663": "You should've never left your grave.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10664": "I've no love for the fool that raised you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10665": "Just a pest beneath my heel.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10666": "There's more where that came from.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10667": "Such a nuisance.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10668": "You picked the wrong fight.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10669": "When will you learn: spiders get squashed.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10670": "You're a poor match for a wizard.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10671": "You've met your end, pup.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10672": "What a barbaric breed.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10673": "I never did care for Herbology.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10675": "Should I be scared or disgusted?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10676": "I've seen bigger teeth on a Puffskein.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10677": "Would you like a demonstration of real magic?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10678": "Shouldn't you be in some hole?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10679": "This is going to be over far too quickly.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10680": "What's wrong? Not as limber as you used to be?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10681": "One of us belongs in the ground.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10682": "A box of bones could put up more of a fight.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10683": "I must say, you have a dreadful odour.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10684": "I'll put an end to your wretched existence!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10685": "I've killed more goblins than there is gold at Gringotts.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10686": "It's time you learn why goblins are the inferior race.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10687": "Make it stop!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10688": "Everything's spinning!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10691": "That's just the beginning.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10692": "To your knees!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10693": "Had enough?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10694": "I'm just warming up.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10695": "You're no match for me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10696": "I hope you settled all your debts.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10697": "They never stood a chance.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10698": "One less nuisance to worry about.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10699": "Little sod should've stayed at school.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10700": "You're going to regret that!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10701": "You will pay for your deed.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10702": "You've made a grave mistake.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10703": "Do that again and I'll squash you like the insect you are.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10704": "I've little patience for such crude tricks.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10705": "I've never seen such magic.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10706": "Where did you learn that?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10707": "Merlin's beard! What was that?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10708": "Haaa! I've had it with you!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10709": "Pfft. Just another arrogant child.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10711": "Haha! Finally put an end to that little Charmgrinder.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10712": "Coward!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10713": "Stand and fight me!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10714": "Agile thing, aren't you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10715": "I shall return your sorry corpse to the ground where it belongs.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10716": "There'll be nothing left of you but ashes!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10717": "This is where your life ends. Permanently.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10718": "This time die and stay dead!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10721": "Please! No!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10722": "Make it stop!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10723": "You're just one more trophy in my collection.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10727": "This is where your vile life ends.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10728": "Just another spider needing to be squashed.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10729": "Stop right there!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10730": "Chilly, isn't it?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10731": "Ah! Nasty flora!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10732": "Damn vegetable!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10733": "Disarm my wand, feel my wrath!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10734": "My wand!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10735": "This had better be worth my time.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10736": "You just wait till I come down.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10737": "I've had enough of this.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10741": "Argh! No!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10742": "Not today.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10743": "Wretched weed!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10744": "I'll rip your brain out your ears and see how you like it!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10745": "Curse that screaming root!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10759": "No, I swear I won't be wasting your time. And I'm grateful for the opportunity – ever so.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10760": "It's a –",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10761": "What? – I be –",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10762": "No! – it's a Niffler!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10763": "He's sharp! Stole from me he did –",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10764": "I – that's what I'm saying: he – he's a natural! – worth his weight in Galleons!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10765": "No, I would never waste your – oh, where's he gone? Come on, you little rascal –",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10766": "Oh, come on, where are you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10767": "He's not a rat. I swear it's not a rat!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10768": "Er – uh – I must've –",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10775": "You cannot simply throw things at me, child.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10785": "What? No. Keep looking. You've seen how much a single feather fetches. Just imagine the whole blooming bird!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10790": "Selwyn would be as sick of this hole as we are if he'd been camped out here as long as we have.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10791": "If the headmaster needs Ferdinand he's going to part with some gold.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10792": "Let's not be foolish. Burning the portrait's like burning money!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10793": "I'm happy to keep or ransom him. Gold is gold.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10794": "You'll never believe who tried to recruit me the other day – the Ashwinders.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10795": "I've not seen one of those Ashwinders who can cast Tarantallegra like I do.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10796": "I haven't lost a duel in years.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10797": "I could duel you with one arm tied behind my back.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10798": "Veritaserum takes at least a month to brew. Where did you find the time?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10799": "Did you brew an antidote as well?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10800": "Do you know anyone skilled enough in Occlumency to resist Veritaserum?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10801": "The Ministry are the real criminals for allowing Dementors to run Azkaban. It's inhumane.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10802": "Prisoners even look different when they get out of Azkaban. Living with Dementors takes a mighty toll on the soul.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10803": "The island itself may be a prison, but the Dementors make you a prisoner of your mind as well.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10804": "Can you imagine the last thing you see being the mouth of a Dementor?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10805": "Ah, who needs the Unforgivables? Plenty of even  nastier spells to use.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10806": "<i>Avada Kedavra</i> is painless. How utterly boring.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10807": "<i>Crucio</i> is my favourite Unforgivable to use.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10808": "Can you imagine working at the Ministry? Day in, day out, trapped behind a desk.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10809": "The Aurors get to have all the fun. Or rather, they ruin our fun.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10810": "Where does one get a body to create an Inferius? Do you have to kill them yourself?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10811": "I'd never suspect Inferi to be so strong with how emaciated they look.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10812": "I suspect you're planning to enchant your Inferius to avoid flames as well?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10813": "You certainly seem nonchalant about reanimating a corpse.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10814": "I suspect my brother's son is a Squib. Bloody shame.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10815": "If my child turned out to be a Squib, I don't know what I'd do.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10816": "I don't want to be associated with any Squibs.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10817": "Wait till Harlow gets a hold of you!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10836": "I hear you! Unless nobody's there, in which case I'm just talking to myself.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10837": "Someone else in here?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10838": "What's that? Is someone actually troll-headed enough to enter an Ashwinders' hideout?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10839": "What were you thinking, coming here? Little Crupmite.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10840": "Thought you could sneak through here, did you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10841": "Should have left when you had the chance.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10842": "Should have known better than to assume someone would sneak into an Ashwinders hideout.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10843": "Must've been a gust of wind.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10844": "Hm. Nothing. That's odd.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10849": "Rookwood says there's treasure here, then there's treasure here. Keep looking.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10850": "We’ll find you. Eventually.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10851": "You don't think he saw it happen, do you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10852": "He's just a child. We should release him.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10853": "Knew you were still hanging about!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10854": "A lamb to the slaughter.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10855": "This is the sort of thing that could draw unwanted attention.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10856": "Goblins better keep holding up their end of the bargain.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10861": "Little Poppy Sweeting! Forgot how to cover your tracks?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10862": "I don't feel bad fleecing those capeflappers in Cragcroft.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10863": "We locked that brazen child up well inside the tent. Harlow'll know what to do with him.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10864": "Taking in children now, are we? Better not be expected to feed him.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10865": "Girl's been nothing but trouble. About time we locked her up.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10867": "I've used Unforgivable Curses on occasion. Fortunately, I'm not looking to be forgiven.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10868": "Got my eye on a few nearby hamlets. They're in more danger than they know.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10869": "What are we even doing here? We ought to be at the Hog's Head. This is a waste of our time.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10870": "I've used the Dark Arts several times. Can't understand why more don't. They're remarkable.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10871": "Do you remember the first life you took? Can't say I do. All a bit of a blur at this point.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10872": "I've seen Mooncalves put up more of a fight.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10873": "Why would you think you could defeat me?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10874": "Should have stayed out of my way.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10875": "Didn't put up much of a fight, did you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10876": "Most disappointed with your lack of skill. Then again, I suppose you are too.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10877": "Never had a chance.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10878": "Picked the wrong person to duel today.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10879": "Held out longer than I thought you would.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10880": "That's all you've got?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10881": "I'd say you were trying to lose.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10882": "So cold!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10883": "I've never felt so cold.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10884": "I hate that spell.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10888": "It's about time you held still.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10889": "Let's see you run now.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10890": "Frozen in fear, are we?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10891": "In trouble now, aren't you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10892": "Ha! The little beast can fly!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10893": "Like that view, do you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10894": "That ought to slow you down a bit.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10895": "Just like a little baby Hippogriff.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10896": "Let me know if you see any dragons up there.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10897": "Thought that would work, did you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10898": "Nice try.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10899": "You'll need to do better than that.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10900": "Felt that, didn't you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10901": "Sorry. Did that hurt?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10902": "Would you stop it!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10906": "Is that the best you can do?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10907": "Barely felt that at all.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10912": "Plants? That's how you intend to defeat me?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10913": "Duel me yourself. Leave your greens out of it.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10914": "I'll certainly move up in Rookwood's ranks after this.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10915": "Lasted longer than I expected you to.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10916": "Wasn't my choice to work with you in the first place.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10917": "We should have never trusted you and your fellow Loyalists.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10918": "Turn on me, will you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10919": "I'm warning you – you don’t want to do this.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10920": "How dare you attack me?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10921": "Rookwood should have never placed his trust in you Loyalists.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10922": "It's so loud!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10923": "Put it away!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10924": "I hate Mandrakes!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10925": "My ears!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10930": "Think you can best me, do you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10931": "You'll not survive this, my friend.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10932": "Feel mildly conflicted about this. Only joking.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10933": "This won't end well for you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10934": "Such agility.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10935": "Impressive.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10936": "You're only delaying the inevitable.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10937": "Will you hold still?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10938": "Argh! Stop!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10939": "Argh! Please, no more!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10940": "I've killed every beast you can imagine. Sure you want to do this?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10941": "Turn and run now, before it's too late.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10942": "Pathetic little thing, aren't you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10943": "The beasts I've encountered usually at least try to run away.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10944": "My wand!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10945": "That's mine!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10946": "Don't do that!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10947": "No!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10948": "No, no, no!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10949": "Aaaargh!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10950": "Not that!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10951": "Please, stop!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10952": "Never cared for plants.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10954": "Always get plants to fight your battles, do you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10956": "I had no other choice!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10957": "I'll get you for that!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10958": "I'm sorry my friend!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10959": "You don't know what you're doing!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10960": "You dare come near me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10961": "That's the student! There, on the Graphorn!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10962": "On the Hippogriff! That's who we're looking for!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10963": "Careful, now. I wouldn't want to have to hurt you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10964": "Reminds me of me when I was young.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10966": "Wouldn't do that if I were you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10967": "What are you playing at? Stop it!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10968": "Don't attack me! What are you doing?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10969": "I'm with you. You know that!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10970": "A bit obsessed with plants, aren't you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10971": "If it isn't the Herbology master. Always bringing plants to a fight.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10972": "You won't knock this wand loose and I'd not try if I were you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10973": "I've seen you use <i>Expelliarmus</i> many times. Won't work on me, I can tell you that.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10974": "Don't assume you can use that <i>Oppugno</i> spell on me. I'm a highly capable wizard.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10975": "I know your methods. I've seen you use <i>Oppugno</i> many a time and I'm ready for it.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10976": "Think you're clever, don't you? But you won't sneak up on me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10977": "You plan to creep up on me, but it won't work – not with me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10978": "You may be more skilled than most students, but you're not better than me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10979": "I've seen your magic. And I'm not afraid of it – or of you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10980": "You've been known to use the Dark Arts, haven't you? Don't think I'm afraid of you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10981": "You're the one who uses the Dark Arts. I'd recognise you anywhere.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10982": "I've seen you duel. Your strategies won't work on me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10983": "I should warn you – I won't make the same mistakes my colleagues have made.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10984": "You've hurt many of my friends, and now you'll pay.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10985": "Quite the impressive fighter, aren't you? But now you've met your match, I'm afraid.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10986": "I'd be impressed by you if I thought trolls were hard to kill.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10987": "You may have defeated a few trolls, but you won't defeat me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10988": "You're the one who had Harlow sent to Azkaban. I'll get you for that.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10989": "I know what you did to Harlow, and I'm not one to forgive.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10990": "You're the one who stole our Hippogriff. You're about to regret that.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10991": "I know you're the one who stole our Hippogriff. We've been looking for you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10992": "You're the one who stole our goblin helm! Well, 'their' goblin helm, but then it was ours.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10993": "You shouldn't go about stealing goblins helms stolen by others now, should you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10994": "I'll get you for what you did to Iona Morgan.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10995": "I know what you did to Iona Morgan, and I'll not forget it.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10996": "You're the one who released our dragon. You'll lose some scales yourself for that.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10997": "You let our dragon go! I'll teach you to meddle in our affairs.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10998": "You're the one who released Treadwell, aren't you? That was a mistake, my friend.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_10999": "You let Nora Treadwell go, didn't you? You're about to wish you hadn't.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11000": "Those Snidgets were rightfully ours, and you knew it.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11001": "We'd have had those Snidgets if you hadn't interfered.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11005": "I wish Rookwood were here to witness your fate.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11007": "Seems we're no longer working together after all.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11008": "And we'd become such close friends.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11009": "Rookwood's lost his head thinking we could trust you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11010": "Should have kept control of yourself – simple creature.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11011": "Shouldn't have turned on a poacher.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11012": "A valiant effort, you unbearable Loyalist.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11018": "I think you'll like this.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11019": "A storm is coming.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11020": "You'll want to defend yourself.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11021": "Let's see how you like this.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11022": "This'll liven things up for you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11023": "Let's see how you handle this.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11024": "You'll want to be especially careful of my teeth.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11025": "Not afraid of wolves, are you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11026": "Careful. There are wolves in the area.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11027": "Oh, I forgot to mention – I'm an Animagus.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11028": "Could use a bit of help here.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11029": "You won't like this – but I will.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11030": "Arise!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11031": "Perhaps I'll try something different.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11032": "How are you at handling Inferi?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11033": "That was easy. For me, at least. Not for you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11034": "Giving up so soon? Have it your own way.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11035": "You were outmatched. Suppose you know that now.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11036": "Must've learned your wandwork from a Muggle.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11037": "Can't believe you're the student I've heard so much about.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11038": "You should have seen the little beasts – the terror in their eyes. Anyone hungry?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11039": "I've never killed a unicorn before, but will. As soon as we're done with this goblin and Rookwood business.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11040": "I kill Nifflers that cross my path. Just to see what's on them. Like little treasure chests, they are.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11041": "Graphorns are beautiful things, aren't they? Which is why I demand so much for them, especially when they're still alive.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11042": "Mooncalves certainly are annoying little things. If they were worth more, I'd kill every one little one of them.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11043": "Killed a Hippogriff north of the Forbidden Forest last week. Daft thing never saw it coming.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11044": "I've killed more Diricawls near Lower Hogsfield than I'd care to count.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11045": "I caught a Graphorn outside Brocburrow. Fetched a lot of Galleons that one did.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11046": "I've captured many a rare beast in the Forbidden Forest. And so I shall still.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11047": "Can't think of a single beast I haven't captured or killed north of here. Wonder there's any left.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11048": "I don't want to work with goblins. Not now, not ever. Rookwood's gone mad.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11049": "It's exhausting – standing here all day, waiting to do Rookwood's work for him. He can fight his own battles.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11050": "When we're done here, I'm going straight to the Hog's Head. Or perhaps I'll just go now.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11051": "I don't trust Ranrok – I'll tell you that. He'll turn on us first chance he gets.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11052": "I may go to Hogsmeade later – stir up some trouble. They need to be reminded that we're still running things.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11053": "Let's finish this job and be done with it. Waste of time, this is.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11054": "I hope Rookwood knows what he's doing.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11055": "How did I get mixed up in this – doing Rookwood's work for him?",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11056": "I've had enough of Feldcroft. Hope I never have to see it again.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11057": "Lower Hogsfield needs some stocks after our little visit.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11058": "I've raided Brocburrow more times than I can count. They're incapable of defending themselves.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11059": "Everyone in Upper Hogsfield shudders when they see me coming – and rightfully so.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11060": "They don't seem to care for me in Hogsmeade. Can't say I blame them what with all I've done there.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11061": "I've robbed every travelling vendor that's passed through here. They never see it coming.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11062": "You'd best watch your step, child.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11063": "That's enough of that racket.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11064": "Ah! How delightful!",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11065": "Try not to make this too easy for me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11066": "I'll make you will wish you were back at a school.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11067": "Ha! Another pitiful beast caught in my trap.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11068": "No more happy days for you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleA_11069": "A lamb to the slaughter.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_00003": "(angry roar)",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_00010": "(angry yell)",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_00011": "(angry yell)",

  "DarkWizardMaleB_10234": "I'm keen for a find, but I'm not easy about this. Not easy at all.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10235": "Best we stay close. The mere sight of our number could make an enemy retreat.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10236": "What if you've got it wrong about this 'secret place'? Have you thought about that?",

  "DarkWizardMaleB_10374": "Cat got your tongue?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10375": "That ought to shut you up for a moment.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10376": "I do hope you're not afraid of heights.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10377": "It's the sudden drop that's truly painful.",

  "DarkWizardMaleB_10381": "I'm just getting warmed up.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10382": "Do you smell something burning?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10383": "Everyone gets lucky now and then.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10384": "You're going to have to stop that. I don't have all day.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10385": "Ah. 'O' for effort.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10386": "Now you're just getting on my nerves.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10387": "That was a mistake.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10388": "Found you!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10389": "You shouldn't be here.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10390": "Perfect. Target practice.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10391": "Pathetic, overgrown excuse for a dog.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10392": "This place has gone to the dogs.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10393": "Oho! Two for the price of one. It's my lucky day.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10394": "How sweet. Did you think your little friend could help you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10395": "Hmm. Which one of you to eliminate first?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10396": "You're going to regret coming here.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10397": "Nobody'll miss one measly little student.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10398": "What do you need me to do?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10399": "How can I help you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10400": "Let's cut this battle short, shall we?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10401": "Nothing like a good cut to the quick.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10402": "Painful? Good.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10403": "Blasted shrubbery!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10404": "Barely a scratch. You'll need to do better than that.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10405": "I've had warts more painful than that.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10406": "Was that meant to frighten me?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10411": "I'll never get used to battling vegetation.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10412": "Is this a battle or are we preparing a charitable soup?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10415": "Ugh. Disgusting beasts. Always sticking their teeth where they don't belong.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10416": "Ugly beast – they'll thank me for this.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10417": "How dare you? You cannot control me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10418": "I – I will not be your puppet!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10419": "Take that, you overgrown lizard.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10420": "Nicely done, if I do say so myself.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10421": "One less goblin in the world is fine by me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10422": "Nothing quite as satisfying as a dead goblin.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10423": "That's dead again, thank you very much.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10424": "I prefer corpses in their inanimate state.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10425": "Back to the grave for you, I say.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10426": "You can't escape death, can you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10427": "Will anyone even notice one less spider?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10428": "Stupid pest.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10429": "Ha. No more bark or bite.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10430": "Poor pup. I jest.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10431": "If I see one more spider –",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10432": "You make my skin crawl.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10433": "Don't suppose you'd respond to 'stay'?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10434": "Back off, hideous hound.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10437": "That's enough, you fanged piece of scenery.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10438": "Go on back to your marsh or cliff or wherever you're from.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10439": "How dare you cast at me, goblin?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10440": "The gall. Presumptive little goblin.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10441": "You goblins have always been a thorn in my side.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10442": "Go back to your tomb.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10443": "That's enough, withering bag of bones.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10444": "Walking corpses give me the shivers.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10445": "Stay back, sacrilegious skeleton.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10446": "The only good goblin is a gutted goblin.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10447": "Ugh. Are you a beast or a being? No matter. You're dead either way.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10448": "Goblins make my skin crawl.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10449": "Aah! Stop that racket!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10450": "My ears! My ears!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10453": "I plan to make quick work of you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10454": "Had enough, yet?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10455": "I could do this all day.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10456": "Ready to scurry back to Hogwarts?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10457": "Oh, that was satisfying.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10458": "You think you can get one over on me?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10459": "One less Hogwarts brat to deal with.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10460": "Finally. Time for a pint.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10461": "That took longer than I would've liked.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10462": "Noooo!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10463": "You will pay for that.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10464": "You will not survive this fight.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10465": "I wasn't myself there for a  moment.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10466": "That's more like it.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10467": "What the hell was that?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10468": "I don't know what kind of magic that was –",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10469": "Something's not right with this one. I'll say that.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10470": "Hurrah!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10471": "Well done, all.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10472": "That was easier than I thought it would be.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10473": "Good riddance.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10474": "You cannot avoid your fate forever.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10475": "Don't worry. There's more where that came from.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10476": "Afraid of a little magic?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10477": "It'll take more than an animated corpse to stop me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10478": "This oughta' be dead easy.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10479": "The only good Inferius is an incinerated Inferius.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10480": "I suppose I'll have to destroy this corpse before I create another.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10483": "How dare you use an Unforgivable Curse on me?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10484": "You'll regret that, I promise you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10485": "I've battled beasts with more skill than you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10489": "Pfft. This should be easy. Eight legs and not a single wand.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10490": "Someone needs to get a broom in here.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10491": "Looks like you've caught a bit of a chill.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10492": "(gasp) Are you giving me the cold shoulder?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10493": "I refuse to capitulate to foliage.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10494": "Damn these insufferable plants.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10495": "Oh, how disarming.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10496": "It will take more than that to slow me down.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10498": "Really enjoying the view but I'd like to be put down now.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10499": "Bored. I'm bored up here.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10503": "Put me down this minute!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10504": "Ah! Do not toy with me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10505": "I will not be assaulted by a giant herb!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10506": "Finally. I can hear myself think.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10507": "Ahh. Peace and quiet.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10522": "I did get offered an extra serving of mash, if that's what you mean?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10523": "'Easy business'?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10524": "Did you want to come to the fairs with me? Good bit of fare they have. Sprouts. If you like sprouts that is.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10525": "Ah. Makes sense. Although I do like custard creams.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10526": "What? One of what?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10527": "Oh, I'm not a Squib. I mean, I do like custard creams.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10529": "So, would you like to come with me, then? To a fair? We don't have to have any sprouts?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10530": "I'm not a Squib!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10533": "Don't know how we're supposed to keep a phoenix from getting past us. Things can fly, can't they?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10537": "I've no idea what Selwyn sees in this place. Nothing left to steal from Moonridge View.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10538": "You think the Ashwinders are impressed by your dancing spell?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10539": "I bet I could take you in a duel.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10540": "Come on, I'll duel you right now! Show me what you've got!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10541": "Are you afraid I'll use my signature Bat-Bogey Hex if I duel you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10542": "What are you planning to do with that Veritaserum?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10543": "I'd spent a month brewing mine and spilled the thing. Nuisance.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10544": "Veritaserum doesn't prove anything! There are ways to resist it.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10545": "I know somebody who just got out of Azkaban. Changed man he was.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10546": "No one deserves to have their soul drawn from them by a Dementor.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10547": "The Ministry's claimed they want to replace the Dementors for years, but they never actually do a thing.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10548": "I've never been able to cast a Patronus. I don't think I'd be able to protect myself against a Dementor.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10549": "How does the Ministry decide which curses are 'Unforgivable'?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10550": "The Unforgivable Curses weren't always outlawed.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10551": "Aurors can still use Unforgivables with the Ministry's permission. Hardly seems fair to me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10552": "I thought I was going to be a Professor. Can you imagine? Me?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10553": "I'm glad I don't have a normal job. I'm happy with my life just the way it is.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10554": "What use do you have for Inferi?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10555": "I hope I never see another Inferius again.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10556": "Have you ever looked an Inferius in the eye? There's nothing there.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10557": "Inferi are the stuff of nightmares.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10558": "I'm not sure which is worse: a Squib or a Mudblood.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10559": "Squibs, Mudbloods, goblins, house-elves – all disgusting if you ask me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10560": "Pure-bloods like us are simply better at magic. Why do the Mudbloods even try?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10579": "Who else is in here?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10580": "Who is that? Is that an Ashwinder? State your name!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10581": "What was that? Did some wretched beast make its way in here?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10582": "Your decision to come here will be your last.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10583": "This is the end for you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10584": "Not very difficult to find, are you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10585": "Hm – nothing. I'm just talking to myself then. Wonderful.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10586": "I don't understand. I know I heard someone over here.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10587": "All that work for nothing.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10588": "Enough outta you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10589": "Got you!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10590": "Coward.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10591": "Is that – ? Someone over there?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10592": "You there! I see you!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10593": "That obnoxious little fella isn't going anywhere. He's deep inside there – all locked up.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10594": "Why bring the lad back here? Kill him and be done with it. Simple as that.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10596": "She's determined to say nothing. The boss will deal with her when he arrives.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_10597": "The girl's friend won't come looking for her. Too dangerous. We're wasting our time.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12084": "All flavour of wicked to be had with the Dark Arts.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12085": "What does it matter if they're still alive? Concentrate on the spoils we'll be leaving with. Crupmite.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12086": "Never understood laws. All they do is interfere with making a success of yourself.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12087": "There's not a thing worth learning from 'civilised' society. Except how to lie.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12088": "When he wasn't looking I snatched it. His own fault. Who looks at the likes of us and thinks we're after Cauldron Cake?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12089": "Enjoy your nap.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12090": "And no one to pay their respects. Shame.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12091": "Courage over common sense, young people today.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12092": "Too late to beg for your life now.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12093": "(sigh) Was all that meddling worth it?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12094": "Cut down so young. What is the world coming to?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12095": "We all get what we deserve.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12096": "Look on the bright side. No more school.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12097": "Someone needs a grave. 'Fraid I'm short for time.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12098": "Next time, listen to your teachers.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12099": "C – can't feel my feet.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12100": "Who d – did this?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12101": "Fire. Put me – by the fire.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12105": "Ah, now that's much better.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12106": "Good behaviour's all about keeping still, isn't it?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12107": "Nice to slow down once in a while. Don't you think?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12108": "This should keep you in one place.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12109": "Don't you look regal up there.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12110": "How's the view?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12111": "Oh dear. Billywig sting?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12112": "Works on all sorts of pests.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12113": "You're mine now.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12114": "Pathetic.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12115": "Too slow!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12116": "You'll need to be quicker than that.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12117": "Bit sharp, isn't it?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12118": "I'll cut you down.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12123": "Hardly felt it. Next!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12124": "That's nothing.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12130": "This'll put me off gardening.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12131": "You think this is a blooming greenhouse?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12132": "I never did mind killing goblins.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12133": "Some alliance this turned out to be.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12134": "Die, goblin!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12135": "Showing your true colours now, aren't you goblin?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12136": "Just the excuse I need to kill goblins.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12137": "Mother always said not to trust goblins.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12138": "I knew it was only a matter of time.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12139": "I can't stand it!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12140": "Blasted thing'll deafen me!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12141": "Argh! Stop!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12142": "My ears are bleeding!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12147": "You won't be missed.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12148": "What, had enough of living already?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12149": "Bit young to be hopping in a grave, aren't you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12150": "Hope there's some Galleons on your corpse.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12151": "Blast you!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12152": "See we have an active one.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12153": "Keep still.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12154": "Stop hopping around, for Merlin's sake!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12155": "No – !",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12156": "Argh! You're – torturing me – !",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12157": "You'll be bones soon enough.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12158": "I'll have you skinned and gutted in no time.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12159": "I'll have your liver for breakfast!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12160": "You'll be dead soon enough.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12161": "Oh, that's clever.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12162": "Oh, no you don't.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12163": "Think you're funny?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12164": "That – is mine.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12165": "I've a pork pie in my belly, do you mind?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12166": "Unhand me!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12167": "Y – you're in for it now!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12168": "You insolent Crupmite!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12173": "I never liked you anyway.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12174": "You gave me no choice.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12175": "It was either you or me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12176": "You'd do the same if it were the other way around.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12177": "Come near me on that twig of yours, I'll make you both kindling.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12178": "Mind where you're going.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12179": "Did anyone see that moonmind riding a Graphorn?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12180": "Riding a Graphorn? Now that's just showin' off.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12181": "I've a mind to blast that Hippogriff out the sky.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12182": "What Crupmite's on a Hippogriff?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12183": "Dark Arts on the premises. Won't someone call an Auror?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12184": "Hmph. I've been looking for a reason to practise my Dark Arts.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12185": "That's the idea; embrace the darkness.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12186": " 'Oh no, it's a burglar!'. No need to fear. I shan't say a word.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12187": "Looking for something, are we?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12188": "Looks perfectly innocent to me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12192": "Cast at me and your wand can sit in your grave.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12193": "Looking for a fight? I'd be on my way.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12194": "Now, now. Don't want anyone to get hurt, do we?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12195": "I wouldn't be trying to get my attention if I were you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12196": "You're no friend of mine, are you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12197": "Where's your head? Or have you lost it?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12198": "Switching sides, are we?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12199": "How have you managed to cultivate such a vicious garden?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12200": "Never seen someone with such an army of foliage.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12201": "Held your own for a while now, haven't you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12202": "Is it you who's been casting <i>Expelliarmus</i> everywhere? You'd have done well working with us.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12203": "Not a good idea to get me riled. You won't live to tell of it.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12204": "Turning into quite the little warrior, aren't you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12205": "Keep your Body-Bind curses to yourself. Understood?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12206": "It was you casting the Full Body-Bind Curse on all of my colleagues! I know a Body-Bind too – it's called a grave.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12207": "You'll die before you have a chance to finish me off.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12208": "There's talk of what you can do; but I've no fear.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12209": "Someone's taking to the Dark Arts early.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12210": "Hope you're not doing anything – unforgivable.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12211": "They say you're hard to hit, but that won't stop me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12212": "Slippery as a Kelpie, they say you are. Don't look much to me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12213": "Your 'luck' at killing us ends here.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12214": "You've put quite a few of my friends in the ground, and I shan't forget that.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12215": "Am I supposed to be impressed that you defeated a few trolls? Well, I'm not.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12216": "Fancy yourself skilled 'cause you've slain a few trolls?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12217": "Just because you had a run-in with Harlow and lived to speak of it, doesn't mean you'll fare well with me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12218": "Remarkable that you took on Harlow. Missed your calling with us my young friend.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12219": "We had plans for that Hippogriff you stole.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12220": "What would you be needing a Hippogriff for, anyhow?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12221": "That goblin helm you pilfered – I'll want that back now.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12222": "Where's the goblin helm, you little thief!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12223": "You killed our Iona. Skilled poacher, she was! Time to pay.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12224": "What did Iona ever do to you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12225": "We're a dragon short because of you. Perhaps we'll have you fight instead.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12226": "You freed that Horntail! I had money on it.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12227": "It's you who interfered with us and that woman, isn't it? The one fixated on Merlin. Shouldn't meddle in other people's affairs.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12228": "It's you. Cost us our ransom. We had that Merlin woman till you showed up, little capeflapper.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12229": "I've seen you. Riding around with filthy centaurs, rescuing Snidgets.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12230": "What, you and the centaurs ran out of Snidgets to rescue?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12234": "Rookwoods don't go down easy.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12236": "And you won't be the last. What was Rookwood thinking?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12237": "It's not right; wizards working with goblins. Damn near traitorous.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12238": "One less goblin's fine by me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12239": "I shall have words with Rookwood over this.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12240": "I knew conspiring with goblins was ill-fated. I told Rookwood. Not directly, but he knew.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12241": "Now tell me we can trust them!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12247": "Don't mind a bit of lightning, do you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12248": "This one's a scorcher.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12249": "Ready for some fun?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12250": "I'd mind that. It can sting a bit.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12251": "Oh the mighty wand!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12252": "Hope you like wolves.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12253": "I'll tear you limb from limb.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12254": "I shall rip your throat out.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12255": "I'm getting hungry.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12256": "I have a surprise.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12257": "Allow me to introduce you to some friends of mine.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12258": "I think you'll like my friends. They don't eat much.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12259": "Quaint – aren't they?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12260": "You're about to see what nightmares are made of.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12261": "You'll be as dead as them in a minute.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12262": "Don't mind if I look through your pockets, do you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12263": "Should've had more sense.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12264": "Bravery in the wrong hands never ends well.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12265": "Hope you'd done your homework.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12266": "You'll be grinning at daisies in no time.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12267": "One of the little bastards scratched me. I let him live just long enough to regret it.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12268": "Beasts don't mind dying to make me a few Sickles.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12269": "Beasts were made to be skinned and eaten.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12270": "Been a while since I killed a unicorn.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12271": "Best thing in the world, finding a beast in your trap.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12272": "Brocburrow's famous for someone having a pet troll and not much else.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12273": "Surprising how many Nifflers you can find down there. Mind you, I do have a knack.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12274": "He's weak. Yes he is! When's the last time you saw him catch a beast? Spends more time petting the things.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12275": "Just because I'm a poacher doesn't mean I dislike beasts. We had a Kneazle at our house. I wept when he died. Hair like silk, he had.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12276": "Ah, but a purse made of unicorn skin; that fetches a few Galleons.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12277": "Aranshire isn't worth the time. No amount of spoils is worth that many spiders.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12278": "I don't waste time seeing if they're dead. Their fate's not on my hands. Only their blood.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12279": "I'll have filled a cemetery by the time I retire.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12280": "We mustn't overlook Feldcroft. Plenty to be had there.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12281": "I'd rob my own father if there were Galleons in it. Not my mother, mind.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12282": "If you owe me Galleons and you can't pay, you'd best get a tombstone.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12283": "I'm surprised I haven't been given more territory. What's Rookwood waiting for? I'm a master at this. A master.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12284": "Plenty of spoils in Keenbridge. Never disappoints.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12285": "The witch in Feldcroft. I was surprised how much jewellery she had. Must've weighed as much as a Graphorn.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12286": "I felt it warranted more than a piece of meat pie. I could've been killed running for him. Blasted Rookwood.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12287": "Could do worse than Pitt-upon-Ford. Shopkeepers keep their shelves full.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12288": "What? Last time I was in Lower Hogsfield? My sack was full of potions. Left the shelves bare, I did.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12289": "The more graves I fill, the more Galleons I get. Won't hear me complaining.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12290": "We all have our paths carved. Mine's robbing. Simple as that.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12291": "You want to watch yourself.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12292": "Mind yourself.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12293": "You should watch where you're going.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12294": "Someone put you up to that? Like something I'd do.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12295": "There's one after my own heart.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12296": "Mind you don't break anything of mine.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12297": "Don't know what Victor was thinking striking a bargain with them.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12298": "They must have come this way. Think!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12299": "Perhaps we'll feed you to the dragon!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12300": "Come on then! Do your worst!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12301": "Should've stayed up at the castle!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12302": "Is that what they're teaching you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12303": "That you, Ernie? Stop your messing about!",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12304": "Whoever's lurking about, I heard you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12305": "Don't know how you got in, but you're not getting out.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12306": "How did you get past the door?",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12307": "Hm – don't know what that was.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12308": "Firewhisky has me hearing things again.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12309": "Nobody'll miss one measly little student.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12310": "Let's get this over with, shall we? I have things to do.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12311": "Perfect. Target practice.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12312": "Oh, I shall enjoy this.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12313": "I hope you have your affairs in order.",
  "DarkWizardMaleB_12314": "You're gonna regret coming here.",

  "DarkWizardMaleC_10092": "I reckon you've got a few tricks up yer sleeve.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10093": "What? That can't be!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10094": "I've not seen the likes of this – who are you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10095": "You've got some skills – for a young'un.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10096": "Not 'alf bad, are ya.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10107": "You’re wastin' yer time tryin' to resist.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10108": "What've you got for eyes? Gobstones?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10109": "Oh, come on! Put some effort in.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10110": "Is that all you’ve got?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10111": "You ever 'eld a wand before?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10138": "Stop that! Stop it, ya stupid fool!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10139": "Put me back down, right now!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10140": "Think you're clever, don't ya. Well, we'll see!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10141": "Show off all ya want, it's you that's for the grave.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10142": "It's your life hangin' in the air, not mine!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10143": "Put – me – down!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10144": "Stop! Please, stop!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10145": "You're burnin' me – argh! Stop it!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10146": "No – please – stop!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10147": "I'll kill ya for this – I'll kill ya!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10148": "It'll take more than this!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10149": "Brrr.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10150": "Does anyone – 'ave – a scarf?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10151": "Someone'll pay for this!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10184": "You know, you're really bringin' out the worst in me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10185": "I never tire o' watchin' the life drain from the eyes of youth.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10186": "I don't know if you look like the burnin' kind?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10187": "I reckon I'd be off if I were you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10188": "How 'bout a little charrin', for someone so charmin'.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10189": "Stronger than you think, eh?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10190": "Ere's a li'l pick me up. Now, ya can't say I'm not generous.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10191": "I think I may've forgot yer birthday. Many 'appy returns!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10192": "Now ya can't tell me that didn't 'urt!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10193": "Wha's the right word I'm lookin' for – oh yeah, surrender!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10194": "Make a wish!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10195": "I shoulda bought some sausages. I fancy a bi' of a roast.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10196": "Never did care for the smell o' burnin' youth.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10197": "Now, you're gonna want a bit o' balm for that.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10198": "You could almost say it feels a bit summery?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10203": "Your feeble mind seems to've led you astray.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10204": "I 'ear the sound o' darkness. It's comin' for ya.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10205": "Any special words ya wan' me to pass on to yer mum?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10206": "Don't s'pose you've made arrangements for yer tombstone?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10207": "If yer gonna die, at least 'ave a smile on yer face.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10208": "Come on then, I can't be waitin' 'round all day.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10209": "Need some 'elp, sunshine?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10210": "Ooh, this'll be a good one.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10211": "Ya know, I've really got a fondness for this.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10212": "Ow are the nurses where yer at? Good I 'ope?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10213": "This must be embarrassin' for ya. I mean, just a bit.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10232": "I reckon when we find this, we'll 'ave trouble on our backs. Once others hear of it, they'll be comin' thick 'n' strong.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10233": "I can't even remember when I first 'eard about this li'l goody, it's bin s'long.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10234": "I say, let an enemy show 'emself. I'll soon show 'em who picked the wrong day to breathe.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10235": "There could be ways around 'ere we don't know about – ways we need to explore.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10236": "I reckon we're gettin' close to this 'ere 'secret area'. I can feel it in me bones.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10237": "Question is, when we find this 'ere secret area, wha' are we gonna find in it?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10238": "You want to talk brave, you weren't there when I outran that Erumpent. Only downside o' bein' so loveable that is – everythin' wants a bi' o' me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10241": "Ladies are so giddy when I'm around, I reckon I should call m'self Billy Wig.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10251": "Don't give me that look. You wanna mind yourself, you do, before I take it into my 'ead to do somethin' that'll give you a real look – of pain.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10252": "Per'aps I was the fool – to listen to you! Per'aps it's me own decisions what need a bi' o' contemplation, eh?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10253": "Yes, always easy to blame everyone 'cept yerself. Never could it be of yer own hand that fortune eludes yer. I reckon – blame is a popular tool – fer the weak.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10276": "What are you, shy? I've seen more courage in a Porlock!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10277": "You'll soon bear the scars o' my wrath! Ya can count on it!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10278": "Thought ya could 'ide from me, did ya?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10279": "I sense somethin' afoot –",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10280": "Something not right here.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10285": "Astounding!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10286": "Haaaa!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10289": "It's never really the wrong day for death, is it?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10295": "If it’s that cat again, I'll –",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10296": "Better not be anyone there. I’m in no mood for killing.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10334": "There's that poacher temper!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10337": "Like it or not, you're one of us!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10343": "Harlow commended me! Me! Can't believe it! Perhaps he'll make me his apprentice or – introduce me to Rookwood!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10356": "You should never have come here.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10357": "I'm going to enjoy ridding the wizarding world of you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10358": "You'll regret crossing my path.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10359": "Your life ends here! Shame.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10362": "Ha ha – hold very still, just like that.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10363": "Are you all right? You seem a bit stiff.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10364": "This'll be the end for you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10365": "Rather peaceful, isn't it?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10368": "That ought to warm you up.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10369": "Let's see you survive that heat.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10370": "Burn, my young friend.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10371": "I'd advise you not to do that.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10372": "Stop that at once.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10373": "Is that the best you can do?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10374": "You're attacking me? Absurd.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10375": "Now, that wasn't very clever.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10376": "I see you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10377": "There you are.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10378": "Now you've done it.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10379": "A wolf? As though I needed more bad luck today.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10380": "This will not go well for you, my four-legged friend. I can promise you that.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10381": "Oh, this is nice. You came here uninvited together, and now you shall die together.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10382": "You should not have come to this place, and now the both of you must be eliminated.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10383": "Now – which of you'd like to die first, or shall you leave that up to me?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10384": "So! The hunt begins!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10385": "I'll have taken your life before you even realise it's gone.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10386": "What's happening? What is this?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10387": "I am at your call.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10388": "You like that, do you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10389": "It'll only hurt for a while.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10390": "Hope you enjoyed that as much as I did.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10392": "Barely felt anything at all.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10393": "Well, you'll have to do better than that.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10394": "This is your first duel, isn't it?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10399": "Plants? In a duel? Pathetic.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10400": "Oh, dear. Fighting with plants, are we?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10403": "Leave me be, you miserable Dugbog!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10404": "I despise all Dugbogs, but this – this is a bad one.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10405": "You'll be sorry you did that.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10406": "How dare you do such a thing to me?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10407": "Blasted Dugbog.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10408": "Hope that's the last Dugbog I ever meet.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10409": "Best of luck with your uprising, all the same.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10410": "That goblin had no chance against me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10411": "Dead again – should be familiar, at least.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10412": "There – and stay dead this time.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10413": "Inferi. Those things are the worst.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10414": "That's the end of you – once again.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10415": "Ugh – I'll never get used to those things.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10416": "Spiders – disgusting things.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10417": "Damned wolf.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10418": "Ugh – I much prefer dogs.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10419": "Ugh – disgusting thing.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10420": "Why must there always be spiders?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10421": "Leave me alone, wretched thing.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10422": "Get away, you miserable creature.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10425": "I'm ready for you, Dugbog.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10426": "This Dugbog doesn't know when to stop.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10427": "You will not survive this, my tiny goblin friend.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10428": "What makes you think you can defeat me, goblin?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10429": "Give up now before you get hurt, filthy goblin.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10430": "You can't defeat me. You can barely even stand.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10431": "I've never cared for Inferi – not at all.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10432": "Hurry up and die. Again.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10433": "You should have remained dead, my friend.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10434": "You and your ridiculous uprising. Stay out of my way, you heinous creature!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10435": "You think you can get the best of me, you pathetic goblin?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10436": "I will not be defeated by a goblin. I know that much to be true.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10437": "Stop it! Put that thing away this instant!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10438": "Mandrakes! I hate Mandrakes!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10441": "Ha! Stupendous!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10442": "There'll be more of that.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10443": "You will not survive this.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10444": "This is not going well for you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10445": "I'd quit now, while you're still alive.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10446": "You're only still alive 'cause I've allowed it – til now.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10447": "Overconfidence – that was your undoing.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10448": "Pathetic little capeflapper.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10449": "You were well outmatched, little bastard.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10450": "Look what you've done. You'll pay for that.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10451": "Now this has become personal.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10452": "You'll die for that.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10453": "What a cowardly way to duel.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10454": "You'll regret that – mark my words.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10455": "What was that? What are you playing at?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10456": "Some sort of Dark Magic, I presume? You'll pay for that.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10457": "Who are you? Be gone from here.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10459": "Ha! Fantastic!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10460": "Ha ha! Wonderful.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10461": "There we are.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10462": "How very agile.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10463": "Didn't expect that.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10464": "What was that?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10465": "Shouldn't you be dead already, wretched thing?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10466": "Inferi? Oh, how I despise these things.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10467": "Oh, marvellous. I'd hoped not to see another one of these.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10468": "Well, well – you look like someone I killed once before.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10471": "What have you done? Oh, this is – argh!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10472": "<i>Crucio</i>?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10473": "You're no better than the beasts I've slaughtered and sold.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10477": "Oh, dear – I really do not care for spiders. Not in the least.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10478": "Be gone from here, foul creature!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10479": "Are you feeling well? You look a little chilly.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10480": "Sorry – it had to be done.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10481": "Oh, how I hate these things.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10482": "Damn it – I've no patience for these things.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10483": "Stop that right now!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10484": "Now you've gone too far.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10486": "You can't keep me here forever.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10487": "How long are we going to do this then?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10491": "Argh! What is this?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10492": "Oh – !",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10494": "Oh, my ears – the ringing.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10495": "You may have caused permanent damage to my hearing!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10513": "We're keeping people out. Pay attention.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10516": "Rookwood should have never put Selwyn in charge. Although I s'pose Selwyn is better than Harlow.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10527": "Let me guess: you're also quite skilled at the Tickling Charm, are you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10528": "Perhaps you should try spells that are a little more challenging.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10529": "Victor Rookwood himself wouldn't dare challenge me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10530": "The Ashwinders would never accept the likes of you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10531": "How much do you have there? Looks like enough for an army!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10532": "How do we know that's actually the potion? Veritaserum is almost indistinguishable from water.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10533": "Don't let anyone catch you with that Veritaserum. You could go to Azkaban.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10534": "It's impossible to stay sane after staying in Azkaban with those Dementors.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10535": "No one has ever escaped from Azkaban. They say it's impossible.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10536": "What do they do with the prisoners' wands?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10537": "There's nothing the Ministry could do to repair the damage they've done.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10538": "Why do we allow the Ministry to decide anything? They allow Dementors to torment prisoners in Azkaban.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10539": "Those Ministry stiffs have never used an Unforgivable Curse in their lives.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10540": "I say that no spell should be illegal!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10541": "This is the life: answering to no one!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10542": "We don't need the Ashwinders. We're doing fine on our own.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10543": "It's unfortunate that there's no way to protect Inferi from fire.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10544": "Imagine an army of Inferi. No pain, no fear – they make the perfect soldiers.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10545": "How could you stop at only one Inferius? Why not make a few extras while you're at it?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10546": "I wouldn't trust an Inferius to do anything. They've no mind nor will of their own.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10547": "If I'd been born a Squib I'd never show my face in public.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10548": "What do Squibs even do with their lives? How do you survive without magic?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10549": "I can't imagine how embarrassing it must be to have a Squib for a child.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10565": "That had better be someone I know.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10566": "What was that? I definitely heard something.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10567": "What's over there? Who is that?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10568": "You knowingly entered an Ashwinders hideout? Want your head looking at.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10569": "How stupid do you think I am?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10570": "Just a child? Well, that's easy.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10571": "Nothing? Hm. Moving on then.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10572": "Hm, that's odd. What's that I heard then?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10573": "Thought I was onto something. Obviously not.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10577": "Victor Rookwood don’t give a Doxy's nip ‘bout your time.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10578": "Oi! Speak o' the devil.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10579": "Mr Rookwood would like a word with you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10580": "We aren't leaving without you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10581": "What a troublesome pair you are.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10582": "No matter – they're still coming with us.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10583": "Fled like a coward.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10584": "Now to finish the job!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10585": "You've come to the wrong place, child!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10590": "Hopefully they locked the boy up so far inside the tent, we never have to see him again.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10591": "What are we supposed to do with the boy? I say threaten him to keep quiet and let him go.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10592": "Nosy little students get what's coming to them. ",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10593": "Students these days. So full of themselves. Suppose that's what we're counting on, isn't it?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10594": "It's not going to work.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10595": "Using that girl as bait? No one's coming for her. We ought to just kill her.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10596": "Only a Hogwarts student would be arrogant enough to come in here alone.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10597": "We should speak to her again. Perhaps she'll tell us where we can find that friend of hers.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10604": "An aversion to the Dark Arts merely highlights an immaturity of thinking, in my mind.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10605": "Don't know why they're called Unforgivable Curses. Using them don't bother me none.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10606": "I've never been afraid of the dark, nor doing dark things.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10607": "Ministry's never done nothin' for me nowise.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10608": "'Wear your guts for garters.' What a silly threat.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10609": "Don't you worry. We'll take care of all the little beasts for you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10610": "I hope your friends aren't too upset.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10611": "Lot of good you turned out to be.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10612": "Right. Now where was I?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10613": "Was that the best Hogwarts has to offer?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10614": "I hope it was worth it.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10615": "I knew you'd go down.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10616": "No more trouble from you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10617": "What a valuable lesson you just learned.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10618": "You got what you deserved.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10619": "Bit chilly, that.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10620": "No more of that.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10621": "I think I'll be on my way.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10624": "Never did care much for vegetables.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10625": "Ah, much better.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10626": "That's more like it.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10627": "What's the hurry?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10628": "You'll hold still now.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10629": "Going somewhere?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10630": "I like you better this way.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10631": "Tsk, tsk. Feet on the ground.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10632": "Not so quick now.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10633": "Thought you could get away?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10634": "Must be new at this.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10635": "Not likely.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10636": "Not so!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10637": "I'll split you like cordwood.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10638": "That ought to cut you down.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10641": "You leafy menace.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10643": "Hardly felt it.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10644": "That all you got?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10649": "Fighting with greens, are we?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10650": "House plants? Very well.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10651": "Never trust a goblin.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10652": "This is more to my liking.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10653": "I been waiting for an excuse to do this.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10654": "I trust goblins half as far as I can throw them.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10656": "The alliance ends!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10657": "Time to spill some goblin blood.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10658": "My ears!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10659": "Put a cork in it!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10660": "Put it away!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10661": "Aaaaah!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10666": "I'll drink your blood.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10667": "I'll grind your guts.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10668": "You want to tussle with an Ashwinder?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10669": "Your luck's run out.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10670": "Flighty little coward.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10671": "Quick little git.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10672": "Rolling away, are ya?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10673": "Stay and fight.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10674": "Make it stop!",

  "DarkWizardMaleC_10679": "Suppose I've time for another kill.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10680": "Hey – that's mine!",

  "DarkWizardMaleC_10682": "Now where did it go?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10683": "That's mine!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10684": "Not fond of this perspective.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10685": "Put me right!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10686": "This is humiliating.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10687": "Whoa, what – Whoa!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10690": "Deserves to be potted.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10691": "Overgrown weed.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10692": "I like you, but I like meself more.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10693": "It's either you or me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10694": "The worm finally turns.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10695": "We were close, but not that close.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10696": "Careful where you're flying!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10697": "Flying little vermin.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10698": "Loathsome creature.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10699": "Who rides a Hippogriff?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10700": "Interesting spell. Very interesting.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10701": "Looks like we might have a new recruit.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10702": "Rookwood ought to see this.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10703": "Learning the Dark Arts, are we?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10704": "You best not steal from me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10707": "You've got some skill.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10708": "Careful who you attack.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10709": "I'll remember this.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10710": "I've killed for less.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10711": "It's you who's making me do this.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10712": "Turning against your own kind, eh?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10713": "You traitor!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10714": "Fighting with veg, are we?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10715": "You and your miserable plants.",

  "DarkWizardMaleC_10722": "Quite the violent streak in this one.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10723": "Careful, this one packs a punch.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10724": "Dark magic, eh?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10725": "You've a little Dark magic in you, don't you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10726": "Stand still!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10727": "Hard to pin down.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10728": "No matter how many of us you defeat, we'll keep coming.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10729": "You're done thinning our ranks.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10730": "Trolls best watch out for you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10731": "Surprised you're not fighting trolls.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10732": "Time for me to avenge Harlow.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10733": "You'll pay for what you did to Harlow.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10734": "Takes gumption to steal a stolen Hippogriff.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10735": "You're the one who freed our Hippogriff.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10736": "It's the one who took the goblin helm.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10737": "Notice you ain't wearing that goblin helm you stole.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10738": "You snuffed out Iona Morgan's future, you whelp.",

  "DarkWizardMaleC_10743": "What, is Treadwell nearby again?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10744": "Snidgets are back. Proud of yourself, are you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10745": "Where's your centaur friends, eh?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10751": "It was fun while it lasted.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10752": "Twasn't meant to be.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10753": "You knew what we were about when you signed up.",

  "DarkWizardMaleC_10755": "Goblins got no loyalty.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10756": "Never wanted to work with goblins in the first place.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10757": "I don't mind breaking a few bones if there's a few Galleons in it for me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10762": "Quite conductive, aren't we?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10763": "Death from above!",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10764": "Might want to look up.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10765": "Flash of inspiration.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10766": "What are your thoughts on 'electricity'?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10767": "Time for the claws to come out.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10768": "Hope you're a dog person.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10769": "I know how to shut you up.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10770": "My bite is worse than my bark.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10771": "Time I show you my wild side.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10772": "Have you met my Inferi?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10773": "Care to see your future?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10774": "The party is about to begin.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10775": "I've just called on some friends of mine.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10776": "Would you like to join their ranks?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10777": "Twas a hard lesson but I'm a dedicated teacher.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10778": "All that bother over a Billywig like you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10779": "And if you come back as an Inferius, I'll kill you again.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10780": "Didn't turn out the way you hoped, did it?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10781": "Meddle with the Graphorn, get the horns.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10782": "Best part of extorting someone is when I get to cast Cruciatus on them.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10783": "Best place to hunt beasts is the Forbidden Forest.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10784": "Brocburrow ain't good for much. Not unless you fancy getting' squashed by a troll.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10785": "For as snooty as Upper Hogsfield is, they don't have much to steal.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10786": "I can't decide what I enjoy more: killing beasts, or skinning them.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10787": "I have a few favourite hunting spots.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10788": "I never met a beast I didn't hate.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10789": "If a beast can't outsmart me then it deserves to die.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10790": "Most stores in Hogsmeade know me by sight, unfortunately.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10791": "Where others see darkness I see bright opportunities.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10792": "Extortin' desperate gits suits me just fine.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10793": "I ain't allowed back in Gladrags, on account of my light fingers.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10794": "I ought to pay that pretty little shopkeeper in Bàgh an Taigh a visit.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10795": "I take what I want.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10796": "I wouldn't go back to Pitt-Upon-Ford if they were givin' out Galleons.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10797": "If I likes it, I takes it.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10798": "If people don't want me to steal their valuables they'd better get a really good lock.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10799": "Locks and guards can't stop me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10800": "Miss a payment with me and I'll make you pay through the nose.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10801": "Not my fault if a customer skips the fine print and I have to break a few bones.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10802": "Nothin' even worth stealing in Marunweem.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10803": "Say what you will about Feldcroft, but the estate is spacious.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10804": "Share and share alike, say I, as I'm robbin'.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10805": "Was it Upper or Lower Hogsfield that we raided last week?",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10806": "Clumsy whelp.",

  "DarkWizardMaleC_10808": "(sinister chuckle)",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10809": "Huh? Oh –",

  "DarkWizardMaleC_10813": "You should never have come here.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10814": "I see you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10815": "Your life ends here! Shame.",
  "DarkWizardMaleC_10816": "You'll regret crossing my path.",

  "DarkWizardMaleD_10201": "That is what real magic looks like.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10427": "We'll need to keep our wits about us once we have the goods. None must speak of it, no careless whisperings.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10428": "A find like this is going to draw every thief from under his rock. We shall need to be very careful indeed.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10429": "If we move with stealth and stay alert, no harm will come. Caution is key.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10430": "More quietly, everyone – we're in unknown territory. Who knows what lurks in our midst.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10431": "I don't see anything out of the ordinary. Certainly no special entrance or anything of the kind.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10432": "Another one of your schemes, this is. I'll believe there's a secret place when I see it with my own eyes.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10433": "I swear, none of you'd have a head left on your shoulders if you didn't have me keeping you in check.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10435": "Might I remind everyone that a wizard's sharpest tool is his mind. Perhaps best to shun that which leads it astray?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10437": "Rally behind strength and you can't go wrong. It's when minds stand behind whimsy that castles fall.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10439": "When the clouds are dark is always the best time to strike. It's as if nature herself lends a veil beneath which to orchestrate one's treachery.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10445": "This is utter nonsense. I've never heard such rubbish in all my life. I should think I'd get more sense out of Mooncalf dung.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10448": "Be it upon your heads when our expectations take flight like Thestrals. Be it upon your conscience when our graves find us all too soon.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10471": "No one hides from me! I'll spot you like a Streeler!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10472": "I know your face now! You shan't evade me again!",

  "DarkWizardMaleD_10475": "It seems we may have an intruder in our midst.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10481": "Aaaah!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10484": "Shame you're dying. You'll miss the smell of death.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10491": "Hm – that warrants a look.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10492": "Someone's going to regret trespassing.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10531": "Pity the side you chose, Poppy!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10538": "Do your parents know what you're up to?",

  "DarkWizardMaleD_10707": "Where's mummy? Eating some Muggle teacakes?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10708": "Oh dear, terribly sorry about your – life.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10709": "Planning a little party over there? Shame no one's coming.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10710": "Let's see. Quick death or slow. Your choice.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10711": "I do hope you've said your goodbyes to your friends. Oh, I forgot. You don't have any.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10712": "Such a crime to let a young one die. Unless it's you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10713": "Any last words you'd like to say?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10714": "What's that? Wishing you'd stayed at home?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10715": "Come, come. What are you waiting for?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10716": "Ah, the young. Make such tragic corpses.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10717": "I pity the soil you'll rot in.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10718": "Farewell thee feeble little child.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10719": "This is almost too easy.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10720": "Come here, Crupmite.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10721": "Oh, the anticipation.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10722": "How unfortunate for you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10723": "Foul vegetable.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10725": "Join me for a walk? No? Perhaps another time.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10726": "Are you all right? You look a little stiff.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10727": "How's the view up there?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10728": "Hope you're not the sort with a queasy belly.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10731": "Oh! Bit of a scorcher, that one.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10732": "Hope I didn't singe you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10733": "Oh dear. Is that burning capeflapper?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10734": "Luck! Nothing more than luck.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10735": "Stop flitting about like a Billywig!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10736": "Ha! Nice try.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10737": "Oh, someone's feeling moody.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10738": "Weak!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10739": "You. What do you think you're doing?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10740": "Stop right there.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10741": "What's this?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10742": "Off me, hound. Back I say!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10743": "Get away from me, vile creature!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10744": "Ah. Two for the price of one.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10745": "Well, what have we here? A bounty of stupidity.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10746": "Well, well. Surely one of you had the sense to turn back? No?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10747": "I'm sure it'd be harder to kill a Mooncalf!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10748": "I'll check your pockets after you're dead!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10749": "Er – I'm sorry – yes?",

  "DarkWizardMaleD_10753": "Not one to mess with, I see.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10755": "Ha. A mere irritant.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10756": "Pfft. A Puffskein could deal a bigger blow.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10757": "Nuisance. That's all you are.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10762": "Ridiculous one has to defend oneself against a plant.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10763": "Has no one heard of using a wand these days?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10766": "Off me, foul log!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10767": "Argh! Get away from me; I'm no Mandrake!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10768": "Wh – what – what did you do?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10769": "What is this? What just happened to me?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10770": "I hope someone burns you in the fire.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10771": "That's the last we'll hear of you, you great lump of – whatever you are.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10772": "One less to worry about.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10773": "No one ever misses your kind.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10774": "Dying must be so frustrating – when you're already dead.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10775": "Your bones will rise no more.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10776": "Haunted chambers await thee, frail monster.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10777": "Hmph. Stronger than they look, aren't they?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10778": "Farewell, vile insect.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10779": "I hate killing insects.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10780": "Roam in eternity, my friend.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10781": "Never my desire to strike a wolf. Ever.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10782": "Back to your web – get back!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10783": "Away from me – away from me!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10784": "Don’t make me have to kill you!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10785": "Argh, no – down – down!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10788": "Away from me, foul, useless log!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10789": "Off! – vile, marsh-dwelling twig!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10790": "Away!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10791": "Despicable wretch!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10792": "You'll meet your grave now, mark my words!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10793": "Off! Get off me with your foul stench!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10794": "What darkness falls from your fingers, wretched creatures?",

  "DarkWizardMaleD_10796": "I command you to stand down!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10797": "If there's one thing that gives me no remorse, it's killing the likes of you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10798": "Never did see eye to eye with goblins.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10799": "No wonder you're not fit for a wand.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10800": "Argh – my ears – make it stop!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10801": "Make it stop, I say!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10804": "Oops.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10805": "Ooh. Too harsh?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10806": "Ha!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10807": "Marvellous strike!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10808": "You may want to move.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10809": "Yes, so should you have fear on your face.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10810": "Ha. Spirited, eh?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10811": "Put up quite a fight though, didn't they?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10812": "I'd never choose to kill someone so young.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10813": "No! – No!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10814": "What have you done – what have you done?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10815": "You – you dare slay one of my own – you will fall!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10816": "Wh – what in Merlin's name – ?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10817": "Who do you think you are?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10818": "Well. We have someone with nerve in our midst.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10819": "These aren't spells to be toyed with.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10820": "You know not what you do.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10821": "Worked up quite an appetite. Anyone hungry?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10823": "I should think we'd meet more challenge from a Bowtruckle.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10824": "One less Charmgrinder. Right – I quite fancy a nap.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10825": "Trite gymnastics won't save you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10826": "What are you, a Gobstone?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10827": "You can't roll your way out of this!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10828": "Come on, then, Inferius! Let's mine the dust from your bones.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10829": "What tragic lives you lead, or should I say, deaths.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10830": "Looking for a bit of a snack, are we?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10831": "You really should try the roast at the Three Broomsticks. Put some meat on your bones.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10834": "Argh! – Argh!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10835": "Stop – make it stop!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10836": "How much could we get for your pitiful flesh, eh?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10840": "Your eight measly spindles are nothing to my wand!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10841": "You don't scare me, bloated insect.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10842": "Chilly – isn't it.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10843": "Ah. I'm afraid I don't have an extra scarf.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10846": "Argh! Give that back!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10847": "How dare you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10849": "All right, you've had your fun!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10850": "Enough! Now, put me down!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10854": "Argh –",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10855": "Wha – argh! Enough!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10857": "My – my ears –",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10858": "(whimpering)",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10865": "If you insist – then we'll have to do this the hard way.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10866": "Brat's tougher than I expected.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10867": "(cackles)",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10874": "Manners are important though, aren't they? Even in a fight.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10875": "I did always like a polite battle.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10879": "Well, if it isn't the little Hippogriff thief. You're not getting away this time.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10881": "I've never met someone who can brew a more potent Drink of Despair.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10882": "I was out-brewing the potions master at Hogwarts when I was only a third year.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10883": "I scored almost perfect O's on my O.W.L.s when I was in school – not that it's done me much good.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10884": "Those Ashwinders are all talk. They're not as strong as they think.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10885": "You must have brewed it yourself. The Ministry is very strict about selling it.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10886": "Veritaserum is so potent, you only need a few drops.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10887": "It's an incredibly advanced potion – I failed that one in school.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10888": "You know my brother is serving a sentence in Azkaban as we speak.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10889": "Prisoners die in Azkaban all the time. They simply lose the will to live.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10890": "The Ministry will pay for the way they treat their prisoners.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10891": "Does anyone from the Ministry even check on the prisoners or are they left completely to the Dementors?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10892": "<i>Diffindo</i> can be just as dangerous as <i>Crucio</i> in the wrong hands – or the right ones.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10893": "The Killing Curse is supposedly painless anyway.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10894": "You have to have conviction to use an Unforgivable. Not everyone has that kind of skill or willpower.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10895": "What about Cursebreakers? I thought I wanted to be one of them when I was a student.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10896": "My cousin recently became an Auror. Now he thinks he's better than the rest of us.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10897": "If you're going to make an Inferius, make sure you also brush up on <i>Incendio</i>.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10898": "Fire is the best way to protect yourself against Inferi.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10899": "I created a few Inferi myself quite some time ago.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10900": "Inferi can be incredibly useful, as long as you're strong enough to control them.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10901": "I'm certainly grateful to be part of a pure bloodline.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10902": "There's never been a shameful Squib in my family's history.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10903": "Squibs are just as vile as Mudbloods in my opinion.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10917": "There! What was that?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10918": "We've no patience for trespassers here. If you can hear me, you'd best move along.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10919": "Whoever that is, you don't want to be here.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10920": "Now is the time when they run.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10921": "This is the wrong place to be. But you know that, don't you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10922": "You didn't hide as well as you thought.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10931": "That's odd. I know I heard something.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10932": "Nobody there, eh? That's a shame.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10933": "Nothing at all? How is that possible?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10934": "Only thing I see is this useless cube.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10935": "Seems I scared off the little Puffskein.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10936": "Back for more? Not the brightest child.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10937": "Shall we finish what we started?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10938": "You've made a mistake.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10939": "Running home?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10940": "If Selwyn's plan works out, you suppose we'll all be rich?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10941": "They better have locked that boy as deep in the tent as they could go. I've no patience for children.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10942": "Harlow would have killed an adult witness on the spot. Why should it be different with a child?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10943": "I'm going to capture the girl's friend. That'd get Harlow's attention. Likely be made a captain for that.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10944": "Gullible children. Walked right into our trap!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10945": "You're a bit of a clodpate, aren't you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10946": "You were warned.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10947": "I'll put some flowers on your grave.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10948": "What a waste of my time.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10949": "Don't forget – I'm a professional.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10950": "Foolish!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10951": "An inevitable ending.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10952": "Another life cut short.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10953": "Should have kept your distance.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10954": "Another pest stamped out.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10955": "Back to the dirt with you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10956": "Feisty little foliage.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10958": "That should hold you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10959": "Feeling a little stiff, are we?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10960": "That'll slow you down.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10961": "Much, much better.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10962": "Now we can begin.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10963": "You won't enjoy this.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10964": "Hope you didn't have plans.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10965": "What's the matter? Feet fail you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10966": "That's better.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10967": "Not on my watch.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10968": "I don't think so.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10969": "Bit of a novice, are ya?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10970": "Bites a bit, don't it?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10971": "Lucky I didn't split you in half.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10973": "Never liked vegetables.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10975": "Ah! I'll put you in a stew!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10976": "Twasn't nothing.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10977": "I've seen Billywigs with more sting.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10982": "I've never been one for gardening.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10983": "I'll make mulch of you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10984": "Little pruning is in order.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10985": "After my wand, goblin? Well, take this!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10986": "Knew you couldn't be trusted.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10987": "What do we need goblins for, anyway?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10988": "Go off then, goblin!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10989": "So it's come to this, goblin.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10990": "You goblins are all the same.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10991": "Never again will I ally with goblins.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10992": "Oh, my ears.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10993": "Hate that sound.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10994": "Ooooh. My head.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_10995": "Gonna make my ears bleed.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11000": "Feeling brave, are we?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11001": "You've just made a fatal error.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11002": "This is where you die.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11003": "I'll punch your ticket.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11004": "Tricky little capeflapper.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11005": "Hold still, you little Kneazle!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11006": "Clever.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11007": "Come back here.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11008": "Argh! Help me!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11009": "The pain!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11010": "I mostly hunt beasts, but I'll make an exception for you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11011": "I'll skin you alive.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11012": "I know just what to do with Crupmites like you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11013": "I think I found a new favourite quarry.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11014": "What's that?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11015": "Where'd it go?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11016": "Hey, that's mine.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11017": "What the –",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11018": "I don't like this!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11019": "Release me!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11020": "This is humiliating.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11021": "This ain't right!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11022": "Miserable weed.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11023": "Back in the ground with you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11025": "Annoying little weed.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11026": "What's taken hold of you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11027": "Bloody traitor!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11028": "Leave off!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11029": "Never trusted you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11030": "Now that's just senseless destruction.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11031": "I'd like to knock that bird out of the sky.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11032": "Fly at me and see where it gets you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11033": "Embarrassing display.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11034": "What sort of moonmind rides a Graphorn?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11035": "Not every day you see some fool riding a Hippogriff.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11036": "Hippogriff's carrying a snack around for later.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11037": "Watch where you're casting.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11038": "You got something to prove?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11039": "I ought to snap your wand in half.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11040": "I've put others in the ground for less than that.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11041": "Locks are made for breaking.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11042": "Huh. Making like a Bowtruckle, aren't you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11043": "Tsk, tsk. No respect for locks.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11047": "You're starting something you might not want to finish.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11048": "Watch where you point that wand.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11049": "You're just asking for trouble, aren't you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11050": "I'd put that wand away if I were you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11051": "That's enough out of you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11052": "Who's side are you on?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11053": "Say good night.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11054": "You must have sap running through your veins.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11055": "If it isn't the little combat gardener.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11056": "Think you're clever, casting <i>Expelliarmus</i> every time?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11057": "Don't try that <i>Expelliarmus</i> nonsense on me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11058": "Don't try casting <i>Oppugno</i> on me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11059": "<i>Oppugno</i> won't work with me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11060": "Careful, now. None of that Petrificus nonsense.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11061": "You try casting <i>Petrificus Totalus</i> on me and I'll make you regret it.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11062": "I know all about you and your violent streak.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11063": "Just how many witches and wizards have you finished off?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11064": "Here to show me some Dark magic, are you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11065": "I know you don't balk at the Dark Arts.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11066": "You're a slippery little Shrake aren't you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11067": "Afraid to take a hit, are ya!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11068": "You've hurt quite enough of our ranks!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11069": "You. Some of those wizards were friends of mine.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11070": "Well, well, well. Looks like we've got a troll slayer on our hands.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11071": "Want me to address you as \"Troll Killer\"?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11072": "You're the one who fought Theophilus Harlow.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11073": "Harlow never hurt anyone who didn't deserve it.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11074": "You're that Hippogriff thief.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11075": "Enjoy stealing Hippogriffs, do ya.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11076": "I'll get that goblin helm back. Hopefully by rummaging your corpse.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11077": "Thought we'd forget about that goblin helm you nicked?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11078": "Iona Morgan was a good poacher.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11079": "Iona Morgan was flourishing before you got to her.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11080": "What gave you the right to free that dragon from Horntail Hall?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11081": "If it isn't the liberator of Horntail Hall.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11082": "You're the little sod that saved Treadwell.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11083": "If it isn't Nora Treadwell's guardian angel.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11084": "If it isn't the Snidgets saviour.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11085": "You and those cursed centaurs just had to save those Snidgets, didn't you?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11086": "We're doing this for Rookwood.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11087": "Rookwood forever!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11088": "You dare impugn the name Rookwood!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11091": "It's like that, is it?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11092": "Rookwood will hear about this, filthy goblin.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11093": "That will be your last mistake.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11094": "I've killed for less, goblin.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11095": "I won't hesitate to kill you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11096": "Time to die, goblin.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11102": "That's a cold that sticks with you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11103": "Never been so cold in all my life.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11104": "Don't want a repeat of that.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11105": "Nice weather we're having, eh?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11106": "Strike!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11107": "Sitting target.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11108": "Hear that? Thunder.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11109": "I just had a flash of genius.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11110": "Let's see how you combat this.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11111": "Now you've gone and raised my hackles.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11112": "I'll rip you apart.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11113": "Think I'm all bark and no bite, eh?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11114": "You'll hear me roar, alright.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11115": "I've got you now.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11116": "How about a little walking death?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11117": "Let's see how you fare against Inferi.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11118": "Hope you don't have a weak constitution.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11119": "Something wicked this way comes.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11120": "That wand will make a nice keepsake.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11121": "Score another one for the Ashwinders.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11122": "Foolish to take me on.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11123": "No one will remember you. No one.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11124": "Enough of this bothersome routine.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11125": "The curiosity they teach at Hogwarts will not serve you well.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11126": "The Ministry ought to relax their feelings toward the Dark Arts.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11127": "Who says crime doesn't pay? Why, I'm practically swimming in Galleons.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11128": "I dream of making a better world. For me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11129": "Thinking in terms of good and evil merely indicates a limited imagination, in my opinion.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11130": "Hogwarts is very lucky they've got protection charms, if you ask me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11131": "Can't figure out why there's such a fuss over poaching. There's enough dumb beasts for everyone.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11132": "You can feed a beast or it can feed you, if you get my meaning.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11133": "Betting on the dragon fights was the best decision I've made yet.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11134": "They come after me, I'll stick 'em like a Nogtail.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11135": "Irondale's not half as tough as it sounds.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11136": "It's been ages since I've found anything worth poaching near Cragcroft.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11137": "Nothing to poach in Aranshire except spiders. Not worth the trouble if you ask me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11138": "Now where did I set my traps, was it Lower or Upper Hogsfield?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11139": "Perhaps I'll scout around Feldcroft for something to poach.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11140": "It's fear, not morality, that keeps most from using Dark magic.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11141": "If you're foolish enough to do business with the Ashwinders you deserve what comes to you.",

  "DarkWizardMaleD_11309": "Nice weather we're having – wouldn't you say?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11310": "Strike!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11311": "They said it might rain. Not sure why.",

  "DarkWizardMaleD_11320": "I've got you now.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11321": "How about a little walking death?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11322": "Stand, wicked bones!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11323": "Let the dead take care of the living!",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11324": "That wand will make a nice keepsake.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11325": "Shame they can't tell their friends.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11326": "Foolish to take me on.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11327": "No one will remember you. No one.",

  "DarkWizardMaleD_11329": "I tell you this: Hogwarts is lucky they've got protection charms.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11330": "Haven't a clue why there's such a fuss over poaching. There's enough beast flesh for everyone.",

  "DarkWizardMaleD_11332": "Betting on the dragon fights was the best decision I've made yet.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11333": "They come after me, they'll rest in ten graves.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11334": "I would say that Irondale is not appropriately named.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11335": "It's been ages since I've found anything worth poaching near Cragcroft.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11336": "Nothing to poach in Aranshire except spiders. Not worth the trouble if you ask me. Legs are far too brittle.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11337": "Now where did I set my traps? Was it Lower Hogsfield or Upper Hogsfield?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11338": "Perhaps I shall scout around Feldcroft for something to poach.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11339": "It's fear, not morality, that keeps most from using Dark Magic.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11340": "If you're foolish enough to do business with the Ashwinders, you deserve what comes to you.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11341": "I've been doing this for so long I've forgotten how to make an honest living.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11342": "Why shouldn't we stand up to our enemies when they seek to bring us down?",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11343": "Aurors don't scare me. My veins are forged from broken rules. They don't know what to do with me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11344": "I provide a service; help keep order. Would've fared well at the Ministry, had it not been for the regulations of course.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11345": "People assume I don't like cake. No idea why. Unless they're afraid to give it to me.",
  "DarkWizardMaleD_11346": "'Steal from those that have it', that's my motto.",

  "DarkWizardMaleD_11353": "Bump into me again. I dare you.",

  "DinahHecat_11163": "You're taking too many hits. Cast <i>Protego</i>.",
  "DinahHecat_11164": "Remember the lesson. <i>Levioso</i> is quite effective in concert with other spells.",
  "DinahHecat_11165": "Cast <i>Levioso</i> to throw your opponent off guard.",
  "DinahHecat_11166": "A perfectly executed <i>Levioso</i>.",
  "DinahHecat_11167": "Class, I hope you were paying attention. That is how you cast <i>Levioso</i>.",
  "DinahHecat_11168": "<i>Finite</i> really spices up a duel.",
  "DinahHecat_11172": "Professors Weasley and Fig asked that I teach you the Disarming Charm, <i>Expelliarmus</i>.",
  "DinahHecat_11173": "Once you complete the assignments I've given, we can begin your instruction.",
  "DinahHecat_11174": "For this exercise you'll be using <i>Levioso</i>.",
  "DinahHecat_11175": "Now, cast <i>Levioso</i>.",
  "DinahHecat_11217": "Well done. Then you're ready to learn <i>Expelliarmus</i>.",
  "DinahHecat_11325": "Where are your school robes?",
  "DinahHecat_11333": "I hope Professor Fig isn't keeping you from your studies.",
  "DinahHecat_11334": "He was quite fond of you – don't forget that.",
  "DinahHecat_11335": "You fought bravely against the goblin rebellion.",
  "DinahHecat_11337": "I'm sure the goblins won't give up so easily.",
  "DinahHecat_11345": "I'd like everyone to cast <i>Levioso</i> twice.",
  "DinahHecat_11364": "Excellent. It's time you learnt one of the most important charms in any duellist's arsenal: <i>Expelliarmus</i>.",
  "DinahHecat_11365": "As before, you'll prepare by completing assignments. These assignments however will require real defensive skill.",
  "DinahHecat_11366": "Good. I distrust neither you nor your abilities, but rather those who would not give pause to do you harm.",
  "DinahHecat_11367": "By itself, 'not holding back' is seldom a winning a strategy. Charging ahead without a plan can end in disaster.",
  "DinahHecat_11368": "Good luck. When you return, I will teach you <i>Expelliarmus</i>, the Disarming Charm.",
  "DinahHecat_11382": "Good. Professor Fig indicated a certain urgency to you completing your defensive magic assignments.",
  "DinahHecat_11384": "Handy for lighting torches, burning away spider webs –",
  "DinahHecat_11386": "Quite. But before we get started, I'd like you to complete a few tasks.",
  "DinahHecat_11387": "Certainly. Complete the list of tasks I provided.",
  "DinahHecat_11388": "Then come and see me. At that point I will teach you the Fire-Making Spell.",
  "DinahHecat_11390": "Glad to hear it. Then you should be ready to learn <i>Incendio</i>.",
  "DinahHecat_11391": "Your spell-casting has impressed me thus far, but please maintain focus.",
  "DinahHecat_11394": "Yes. I'm sorry to say, I've visited enough careless colleagues at St Mungo's to assure you that fire is a fickle servant.",
  "DinahHecat_11397": "Let us begin. And remember: focus on the proper wand movement.",
  "DinahHecat_11398": "Well done. <i>Incendio</i> will be a useful spell to have in your repertoire.",
  "DinahHecat_11400": "You're getting it. Keep at it, and do try not to incinerate yourself.",
  "DinahHecat_11402": "Excellent. Nothing worth doing comes easily.",
  "DinahHecat_11404": "You seem to have the right end of the stick, but keep practising. <i>Expelliarmus</i> may save your life one day.",
  "DinahHecat_11422": "Well done.",
  "DinahHecat_11423": "Now, cast <i>Levioso</i> again.",
  "DinahHecat_11424": "What was what?",
  "DinahHecat_11437": "Professor Fig has asked me to work with you on a new spell. Please come to see me at your earliest convenience.",
  "DinahHecat_11438": "Professors Fig and Weasley have asked that I teach you an additional defensive spell.",
  "DinahHecat_11451": "I know when I see a winning bet, and Ravenclaw would not have been that. Not this year, anyway.",
  "DinahHecat_11452": "I suppose you should.",
  "DinahHecat_11501": "Glad to see you are taking defensive magic seriously.",
  "DinahHecat_11502": "That's all for now. Remember to practise daily.",
  "DinahHecat_11503": "Ah. I believe we have some matters to discuss.",
  "DinahHecat_11504": "<i>Levioso!</i>",
  "DinahHecat_11528": "Pay close attention. The Disarming Charm may often be all you need to defeat the most powerful Dark witches and wizards you might encounter.",
  "DinahHecat_11529": "It might well save your life.",
  "DinahHecat_11530": "No better defence against Dark Magic than preventing your foe from ever casting it.",
  "DinahHecat_11531": "Be prepared. These assignments are meant to challenge you.",
  "DinahHecat_11532": "I hope you were able to take care of everything I had asked you to do.",
  "DinahHecat_11533": "Spell-casting requires a focused mind and a steady wand.",
  "DinahHecat_11534": "You know where to find me once you've finished.",
  "DinahHecat_11535": "Concentrate, and keep your wand steady.",
  "DinahHecat_11536": "As such, you are to learn <i>Incendio</i>, the Fire-Making Spell.",
  "DinahHecat_11537": "– and, when necessary, defending against those who would wish to do us harm.",
  "DinahHecat_11538": "When you're finished, come and see me. Then we shall begin working on <i>Incendio</i>.",
  "DinahHecat_11539": "I would rather we not end today's lesson with your robes aflame.",
  "DinahHecat_11540": "In the real world, your opponents will not hold back.",
  "DinahHecat_11541": "Let us begin with the Basic Cast.",
  "DinahHecat_11542": "See how the dummy deflected your cast?",
  "DinahHecat_11543": "Remember, a surprised opponent is a weak opponent – as Master Prewett so artfully helped me demonstrate earlier.",
  "DinahHecat_11544": "Still at it, I see.",
  "DinahHecat_11545": "Setting things ablaze is certainly cathartic, isn't it?",
  "DinahHecat_11546": "I trust Mr Brattleby was able to accommodate you and that you found success in your – endeavours?",
  "DinahHecat_11548": "Surely you have better things to do than risk detention by wandering where you shouldn't.",
  "DinahHecat_11549": "Ha! My instincts are never wrong. I knew someone was intruding here.",
  "DinahHecat_11550": "Show yourself. Now.",
  "DinahHecat_11551": "If I catch a student in here there will be consequences.",
  "DinahHecat_11552": "Perhaps no one is here now, but I'd wager someone was.",
  "DinahHecat_11553": "If someone was here, they seem to have moved on. Wise decision.",
  "DinahHecat_11564": "I put you on the spot and you rose to the challenge. Points to Gryffindor.",
  "DinahHecat_11565": "I put you on the spot and you rose to the challenge. Points to Ravenclaw.",
  "DinahHecat_11566": "I put you on the spot and you rose to the challenge. Points to Slytherin.",
  "DinahHecat_11567": "I do enjoy a lively duel.",
  "DinahHecat_11568": "If only all of my students were this adept.",
  "DinahHecat_11569": "<i>Finite</i>? Clever choice.",
  "DinahHecat_11570": "So, I'd advise you to keep practising whenever you can. Perhaps Mr Sallow will have some ideas for you.",
  "DinahHecat_11572": "Again, well done today. I shall reach out soon with additional assignments.",
  "DinahHecat_11573": "You may be surprised by some of them. Astonishing how much students don't think their professors know.",
  "DinahHecat_11574": "Good work. Feel free to practise in the classroom before you go.",
  "DinahHecat_11575": "I've set up a few targets for you.",
  "DinahHecat_11576": "Good work. The dummy is here if you wish to stay and practise.",
  "DinahHecat_11577": "Please complete the assignments I have given you and then proceed to see me in my classroom.",
  "DinahHecat_11610": "Now, I want a fair duel using only <i>Levioso</i>, Basic Cast, and <i>Protego</i>.",
  "DinahHecat_11617": "As for the students – well, they seem to get more capable every year.",
  "DinahHecat_11618": "I do. What is it?",
  "DinahHecat_11619": "Although – we got up to just as much mischief in my day as you seem to now. I used to look the other way at all sorts of roguery when I was Head Girl.",
  "DinahHecat_11620": "Keep up with your wandwork. One must always be prepared for mischief – both inside and outside of the castle.",
  "DinahHecat_11621": "Hmph. Perhaps. Good to see you think things through.",
  "DinahHecat_11622": "I can tell you, however, that I did once admonish a certain Phineas Nigellus Black for enjoying a Sugar Quill during a lecture.",
  "DinahHecat_11623": "Ah! As you might suspect, I cannot speak about what we did. Suffice it to say, the job was not without its – hazards.",
  "DinahHecat_11624": "I see. Well, the castle itself, as I'm sure you have surmised, is full of surprises. I daresay more than the staircases change around here.",
  "DinahHecat_11625": "I did. I am a proud member of Ravenclaw house.",
  "DinahHecat_11626": "I did. I am a proud member of Ravenclaw house, like you.",
  "DinahHecat_11627": "Now, I hope I've satisfied your curiosity for the moment.",
  "DinahHecat_11628": "Ah, well, it was the risk I took with my prior position. You may or may not have heard that I was an Unspeakable at the Ministry for years.",
  "DinahHecat_11629": "Why do you ask?",
  "DinahHecat_11630": "Appearances can be deceiving. You see, I was once wounded by time itself.",
  "DinahHecat_11631": "What is it that you need?",
  "DinahHecat_11632": "Your curiosity is understandable. Well –although I can't speak in any detail of my work, I can tell you certain – interesting facts.",
  "DinahHecat_11633": "Ah, but I don't truly know how much time I have lost. Without saying more, perhaps whatever time I've lost was in exchange for time gained.",
  "DinahHecat_11634": "Now, you needn't concern yourself with my injury. I made peace long ago with the fact that a sprig of dittany, once plucked, will surely begin to wilt.",
  "DinahHecat_11635": "Kind of you to say. Speaking of time, perhaps yours would be best spent honing your defensive wandwork?",
  "DinahHecat_11636": "Indeed.",
  "DinahHecat_11637": "Unspeakables work in the Ministry's Department of Mysteries. Dangerous work at times, as you've no doubt guessed.",
  "DinahHecat_11638": "And to dwell on such matters is a waste of the days ahead.",
  "DinahHecat_11639": "Yes, I can tell you that my years at the Ministry were well spent. And I'm as happy to be at Hogwarts now as I was to be in the Department of Mysteries years ago.",
  "DinahHecat_11640": "At this point, no magic permits us to travel back in time. Perhaps one day.",
  "DinahHecat_11641": "It's a matter of perspective. Without saying more, perhaps whatever time I've lost was in exchange for time gained.",
  "DinahHecat_11643": "That doesn't look like the regulation uniform to me.",
  "DinahHecat_11646": "Just what are you up to, Eleazar –",
  "DinahHecat_11647": "Oh, Eleazar. At least you'll be with Miriam now.",
  "DinahHecat_11648": "That troll attack is precisely why we need Defensive magic.",
  "DinahHecat_11649": "Ranrok's siege is exactly why I teach my subject.",
  "DinahHecat_11650": "My highest regards for completing the Field Guide.",
  "DinahHecat_11651": "I wonder how I can get Amit to improve his duelling skills.",
  "DinahHecat_11652": "That's the third detention I've given Everett this week.",
  "DinahHecat_11653": "You're lucky that I'm no longer an Unspeakable.",
  "DinahHecat_11655": "Never been prouder than for how you handled Ranrok.",
  "DinahHecat_11656": "Excellent defensive skills!",
  "DinahHecat_11657": "Mind the elderly, if you please.",
  "DinahHecat_11658": "(effort sound)",
  "DorothyDencourt_10151": "Bardolph Beaumont should have returned by now. Had by Dark wizards, he was.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10154": "Shame Bardolph thought Dark Magic was the answer. I reckon Rookwood's played a hand in his disappearance.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10155": "I did. I don't think we've met. I'm Dorothy Sprottle.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10156": "Afraid not. I've spoken with Claire – still worried sick about her brother.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10171": "I'd have bet my last Galleon he'd been kidnapped. But turned into an Inferius? Poor man. And poor Claire.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10172": "Makes no sense. Bardolph would never have run off, not for good.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10177": "Oh, dear Sirona. A gem. Has been for as long as I've known her.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10181": "Oh, thank you! How wonderful. The travelling vendors will be thrilled to replenish their stock of Wiggenweld Potion.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10182": "That would be wonderful. I'm worried about the travelling vendors and would love to get them more Wiggenweld Potion.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10183": "Hello, dear. Was there something else I could help you with?",
  "DorothyDencourt_10184": "Hello. If you're here for Wiggenweld Potion, I'm sorry to say I have none at the moment.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10191": "I was just worrying about Claire Beaumont's brother Bardolph, only he's gone missing.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10195": "Any help would be appreciated. You might speak to Claire first. Perhaps she has some insights that I don't.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10197": "Oh, hello again. How nice to see you. And, yes, I did.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10198": "He was last seen heading towards the Forest with one of Victor Rookwood's lot.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10199": "I'd help search for him myself, but no one will risk encountering Ranrok's Loyalists. They seem to be everywhere.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10200": "Rumour is, he was seen in the Forest practising Dark Magic. Saw him myself near some ruins with Rookwood's lot, I did.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10202": "I think he sought the Ashwinders out to learn their secrets. Victor Rookwood, at least, seems somehow immune to Ranrok's Loyalists.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10203": "Shame, really. With Ranrok's camps cleared out, I have a feeling he'd have given up on Dark Magic altogether.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10205": "Claire will be at her shop, if you'd like to speak with her.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10206": "Indeed he was! I'd almost forgotten. I stumbled upon it just before Aidan died.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10207": "He was hoping to go through it with Sirona over a Butterbeer or two. Those two were always like two Bowtruckles in a branch.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10209": "Aidan took ill when he was collecting Horklumps on his way to see her. He made it home – but I fear he dropped the box in the cavern.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10210": "The cavern is in the hills just southwest of our hamlet. You can gather Horklumps and collect the box of letters there.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10211": "The cavern is in the hills just southwest of our hamlet. You should find the box of letters there.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10212": "Thank you. I'll be here if you are able to collect those Horklumps. I – and the vendors I help – would greatly appreciate it.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10213": "And she's correct. My darling Aidan used to collect Horklumps for me. Since he died, my supply has dwindled.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10214": "Oh, thank you. Love of my life. A bit lost without him.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10215": "If you wouldn't mind gathering some Horklumps for me, I'd be happy to compensate you for your time.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10216": "My pleasure. And thank you again for the Horklumps. Can't wait to get brewing.  Do give my love to Sirona.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10217": "I hope you're able to find the cavern.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10218": "Goodness! Well, she was almost exactly like she is now – charming, good head on her shoulders, taking care of everyone.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10219": "I can't tell you the fun we had when she and her friends would visit us during the year. All buzzing about, practising charms.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10220": "Talented group. Her friend Mirabel was a genius in the garden. Learned it all from her Muggle parents, if you can believe it.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10221": "In a cavern in the hills just southwest of our hamlet. I'm almost certain Aidan dropped it there.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10222": "In a cavern in the hills just southwest of our hamlet.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10223": "Oh, thank you! How wonderful. The travelling vendors will be thrilled to replenish their stock of Wiggenweld Potion.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10224": "And Sirona will be delighted to have those letters.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10225": "No. Bardolph's run that shop with Claire his entire life. He'd not give it up – for anything.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10226": "He swore he'd be back in a fortnight. My instincts are that he's been held captive – or worse.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10229": "I fear he got himself into trouble with the Ashwinders. Especially if he made them a promise he couldn't keep.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10230": "I can tell you that Bardolph was last seen in the Forest wearing a particular woollen jumper – one that Claire knitted herself.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10231": "Oh, he had a terrible run in with Ranrok's Loyalists. Changed him. He vowed never to feel powerless again.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10232": "How kind of you. Now you be careful heading back to Hogsmeade.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10233": "Oh, of course! A few letters from some of her school friends. Some nice memories.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10234": "I even included a letter Sirona had written to me when she was staying with us. Thought she might enjoy reading it.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10235": "I know when I read writing from my youth, I'm always astonished at how much I've changed – and yet remain the same.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10236": "Hope they know what they're doing. Brooms can be dangerous.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10237": "Riding a Graphorn? What on earth?",
  "DorothyDencourt_10238": "Is that child riding a Hippogriff? Thought I'd seen everything.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10239": "Is that what children are wearing now? Never thought I'd see the day.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10240": "Don't know what to make of trolls attacking Hogsmeade. Never heard of anything like it.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10241": "Is it true that those Loyalists attacked Hogwarts, of all places? Seems their confidence was the root of their downfall.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10242": "The Dark Arts are forbidden. You know that.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10243": "A fine spell, but difficult to master.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10245": "Now, don't be doing that.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10246": "Oh, dear. My apologies.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10247": "You'll wake the dead with all that noise.",
  "DorothyDencourt_10248": "I think he sought the Ashwinders out to learn their secrets.",
  "DumfreyWestland_10010": "Oi, Nestor! Look who's here!",
  "DumfreyWestland_10011": "Probably come to try to beg his way in again.  Ha!",
  "DumfreyWestland_10012": "Discovered already? Looks like we need to find another pumpkin to hide in, eh Jackdaw?",
  "DumfreyWestland_10016": "Good job, I suppose. But we're not through with you.",
  "DumfreyWestland_10017": "You make this look easier than it's supposed to be.",
  "DumfreyWestland_10018": "So you found us. This ain't over yet.",
  "DumfreyWestland_10024": "Not too bad – for a mortal. Now, say what you need to say to ol' Jackdaw here. You've earned it.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10329": "Professor Ronen reminds me of my grandfather. Loads of wisdom, but a bit mad.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10330": "You're quite close to Professor Fig, aren't you? I've always wondered about him. Never see him actually teaching.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10331": "I wonder if you might be able to help me with a small, er, project.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10332": "Spare a moment? I could use your help.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10333": "Thank you for all of your help. No more 'Puffskein Dunkein' for me.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10335": "Should never have trusted you.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10337": "That's one leaf? Must have been a giant Venomous Tentacula! It's even more than I expected. I knew you were the one to ask.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10338": "I appreciate you getting it for me.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10339": "You can't be serious. This is awful. I don't know what to do now.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10340": "This is sure to put an end to 'Puffskein Dunkein' for good when I show everyone in the common room tonight.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10342": "Thank you again, and have a good day. I know I will.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10345": "I did. Hello, I'm Duncan Hobhouse. Pleasure to meet you.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10349": "I'm going to presume your reputation is in fact warranted – in which case you are precisely the person I need.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10350": "Regardless of how reasonable I believe my fear of Puffskeins to be, I'm beginning to get a reputation as a coward. Some have even taken to calling me 'Puffskein Dunkein.'",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10355": "Grand. I'd very much appreciate it. Come and find me if you get the proof. I shall be forever in your debt.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10358": "Exactly. I wish more of our fellow students agreed with you.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10359": "It may seem irrational to you, but my experience with them has been most upsetting. They eat bogeys, you know.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10360": "Yes. Rumour has it that the Herbology professor before Professor Garlick kept dangerous plants there.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10361": "I was hoping you could go there and bring back evidence that I could use to show that, well, I'd gone in.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10362": "You've wasted my time. You're not who I thought you were.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10363": "I've heard all about you, of course. Confronting trolls and dragons.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10364": "You see, we were learning to repel Boggarts in Professor Hecat's class and, well, mine unfortunately took the shape of a – a Puffskein.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10365": "They seem adorable until one sticks its tongue up your nose.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10366": "Thank you. Poppy keeps offering to help me in overcoming my fear, but I'm too afraid to take her up on it.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10367": "I do not have to admit that. Everett said the same thing.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10368": "Anyway, to make matters worse, I stupidly blurted out that I must be braver than people think since I have been in the Hidden Herbology Corridor.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10372": "It's supposedly so overrun now that no one dares enter it anymore.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10373": "Say, a bit of an exceptionally dangerous plant of some kind?",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10374": "Goodness!",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10375": "I haven't a clue. But have you seen the kinds of plants Professor Garlick grows?",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10377": "Certainly. I need you to sneak into the Hidden Herbology Corridor and bring back some sort of dangerous plant.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10378": "Then I'll tell everyone I found it. That should get people to stop calling me 'Puffskein Dunkein'.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10379": "I haven't been called 'Puffskein Dunkein' once since you brought me that Venomous Tentacula leaf.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10380": "'Puffskein Dunkein' is still all I hear. Thanks for being an utter waste of time.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10381": "This'll show Everett how ridiculous that nickname was.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10382": "I don't need to be stronger! I need to be left alone. Even Zenobia Noke will make fun of me now.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10383": "Have you found anything to, uh, prove my bravery yet?",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10384": "If the previous professor was anything like her, I'd imagine they're not exactly harmless.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10385": "I think – I am actually braver.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10386": "Oh thank goodness!",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10387": "I wonder if that's the new broom at Spintwitches?",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10388": "What sort of moonmind rides a Graphorn?",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10389": "I hope they're holding on tight to that Hippogriff.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10390": "Perhaps we'll avert our eyes until you decide to get dressed.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10391": "I suppose it's a good thing Professor Fig wasn't teaching any classes.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10392": "I still don't understand how trolls lumbered into Hogsmeade in the first place.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10393": "Wonder what it was like fighting the Loyalists?",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10394": "I dare you to try that again.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10395": "Keys are quicker, you know.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10397": "Someone's got a hang of their spellwork.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10398": "They're still calling me 'Puffskein Dunkein' and you had the chance to do something about it.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10399": "I haven't heard any nasty comments lately. Not since you got me that Venomous Tentacula leaf.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10400": "I beg your pardon.",
  "DuncanHobhouse_10401": "Poor soul. Must've failed a potions test.",
  "EddieCleaver_10000": "Get away from me!",
  "EddieCleaver_10001": "Come now, Anabelle! It was a long time ago!",
  "EddieCleaver_10002": "I'm sorry, I'm sorry!",
  "EddieCleaver_10003": "What do you want?",
  "EddieCleaver_10004": "Leave me be!",
  "EddieCleaver_10005": "That life is behind me, I promise!",
  "EddieCleaver_10006": "I cannot do this for all eternity!",
  "EddieCleaver_10007": "It was an accident!",
  "EddieCleaver_10008": "If I could undo all that happened that day, I would!",
  "EddieCleaver_10009": "Aah – aah – aaargh!",
  "EddieCleaver_10010": "Argh!",
  "EddieCleaver_10011": "Let us keep our heads about this. I am truly sorry. I didn't mean –",
  "EddieCleaver_10012": "Aaaaaargh!",
  "EddieCleaver_10013": "You've made your point!",
  "EddieCleaver_10014": "May we talk about this?",
  "EddieThistlewood_10033": "I'd be terribly grateful if you could help me – and my friend – with a time-sensitive delivery.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10034": "Hello? Might you have time to help with an urgent delivery?",
  "EddieThistlewood_10035": "Oh, yes. I could.  Eddie Thistlewood's the name.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10043": "Did you deliver the Chinese Chomping Cabbages to my friend Bernard yet?",
  "EddieThistlewood_10044": "I'm convinced that Feldcroft will be much safer with Chinese Chomping Cabbages defending them.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10047": "Careful near the tunnel. There's a troll living inside. Mustn't understand that a train could be coming soon.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10049": "Now, how may I be of service?",
  "EddieThistlewood_10051": "Oh, it's relatively safe – aside from our local troll, of course.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10052": "Hard to believe, isn't it? Especially for someone so young – but no. Some folk just aren't born with the need to wander.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10055": "Never attended Hogwarts myself. In fact, I've never been more than a stone's throw from our humble hamlet.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10056": "Folks are saying the troll's been dealt with. Suppose it could have been a train that killed it, but who can say?",
  "EddieThistlewood_10064": "Oh, thank you. I shall let Bernard know he might be receiving those cabbages after all.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10067": "You see, I know plants. And I believe the goblins will be so irritated by the onslaught of ferocious vegetation, they'll simply leave Feldcroft alone.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10068": "I wonder if you might track the two crates down and deliver their contents to my friend Bernard Ndiaye. I simply can't leave my shop at present.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10069": "But it won't survive for long – if it hasn't succumbed to a speeding locomotive already. It lives in a train tunnel. ",
  "EddieThistlewood_10070": "My sister Helen, on the other hand. She saw some of the world in her time as an Auror. But I'm happy here.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10071": "My friend Bernard says they've been seen in the area for a while. He seems to think they're looking for something.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10074": "But lately, they've become more aggressive.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10079": "How fortunate to see you – the, what was it? Troll Slayer or Vanquisher? – Whisperer?",
  "EddieThistlewood_10080": "No matter. You clearly know how to get things done.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10081": "I sent two crates of Chinese Chomping Cabbages to help, but they've gone missing.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10083": "I did indeed.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10084": "Yes, from what I hear, one was spotted south of Feldcroft. The other – so I hear – is south of Brocburrow, near the river.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10086": "You saved Brocburrow from that troll. I want to talk to you.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10087": "My thoughts precisely.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10089": "I suppose I could. But that would take time. Time we do not have, what with Ranrok's thugs posing new threats every day.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10090": "Besides, it's the principle of the matter. I grew those cabbages and they are extraordinary.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10092": "Tell you this: I shan't be caught in such attire.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10093": "That troll's gone, thanks to you. Our very own Troll Vanquisher.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10094": "It's our Troll Slayer. Thank you again. Things are certainly more settled around here now.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10095": "You're on a dangerous path, you are.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10097": "Stop that.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10098": "The Troll Whisperer! All of Brocburrow is in your debt.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10099": "Welcome, welcome. Do have a look around.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10100": "That ought to serve you nicely.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10101": "I'll be able to put that to good use.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10102": "You haven't got enough for that, I'm afraid.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10103": "Thank you. I hope to see you again soon.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10104": "Now how can I help?",
  "EddieThistlewood_10105": "My fault. Possibly.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10106": "Making ourselves useful, are we?",
  "EddieThistlewood_10118": "Eddie Thistlewood's the name. Listen, a friend of mine in Feldcroft needs help fighting Ranrok's Loyalists.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10119": "A dear friend of mine in Feldcroft is at his wits' end due to the relentless attacks on his hamlet by Ranrok and his Loyalists.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10120": "Ah, it's you again. My favourite Hogwarts student.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10121": "I'm happy to report that my sister survived that sudden attack by Anne. Thank you for your help.",
  "EddieThistlewood_10122": "Jackdaw has promised to work with the Ministry and Helen to see what, if anything, can be done for Anne.",
  "EdgarAdley_10106": "Adley. Edgar Adley. And no, no I don't think so.",
  "EdgarAdley_10108": "Blast Milo and his mad schemes.",
  "EdgarAdley_10109": "All I had to do was follow him into the Forbidden Forest.",
  "EdgarAdley_10110": "Had I known he wanted to procure venom from a living Acromantula –",
  "EdgarAdley_10111": "Oh, poor Milo. He didn't deserve to go like that.",
  "EdgarAdley_10112": "Thank you.",
  "EdgarAdley_10113": "In fact, as he died, Milo begged me to take his heirloom pocket watch –",
  "EdgarAdley_10116": "No, no. Milo wouldn't have thought that way. He wasn't a bad wizard. Merely a bit – overconfident at times.",
  "EdgarAdley_10117": "You can't possibly go to that Acromantula's cave – you'd be killed!",
  "EdgarAdley_10118": "Please – forget I said anything.",
  "EdgarAdley_10121": "My friend, Milo, and I went to an Acromantula's cave, hoping to harvest its venom.",
  "EdgarAdley_10122": "It didn't go well. I barely escaped. Milo wasn't so lucky.",
  "EdgarAdley_10123": "Merlin's beard! How did you – ?",
  "EdgarAdley_10124": "Actually, I don't want to know. I don't want to think about that Acromantula ever again. ",
  "EdgarAdley_10125": "Thank you. Thank you very much.",
  "EdgarAdley_10127": "I am too. As farfetched as his schemes were, Milo was a good friend and I shall miss him.",
  "EdgarAdley_10129": "I should never have mentioned the heirloom. Such selfishness.",
  "EdgarAdley_10130": "I can't go back there.",
  "EdgarAdley_10131": "Oh, Milo, what am I to do?",
  "EdgarAdley_10133": "I can never face Milo's daughter again.",
  "EdgarAdley_10134": "Please – accept this reward for your trouble.",
  "EdgarAdley_10135": "I – of course I'm happy to pay you. I can't afford much. I've promised to pay for all the supplies Milo's daughter will need to attend Hogwarts one day.",
  "EdgarAdley_10137": "Thank you. I know that Milo's daughter will be glad to have this.",
  "EdgarAdley_10138": "I can't think of it – Milo's body, still in that cave with The Absconder.",
  "EdgarAdley_10139": "Milo's name for the Acromantula. He did have a flair for the dramatic.",
  "EdgarAdley_10140": "Here is your money, you extortionist.",
  "EdgarAdley_10141": "He was my friend. Came to me a few days ago with a 'brilliant plan' to make some quick Galleons.",
  "EdgarAdley_10142": "– so that his daughter would have something to remember him by. But I – I fled.",
  "EdgarAdley_10143": "Ah, you look none the worse for wear. I take it you decided against entering the Absconder's cave, then?",
  "EdgarAdley_10144": "Milo can rest in peace now that his wishes have been fulfilled and his daughter has something to remember him by.",
  "EdgarAdley_10145": "You're no better than Rookwood and his Ashwinders.",
  "EdgarAdley_10146": "For you? Always. You're a hero around here.",
  "EdgarAdley_10152": "Not much to tell. I'm a merchant, but I also make it my personal business to provide every customer with what they need.",
  "EdgarAdley_10153": "Everything is peaceful now. Or as peaceful as one could expect, given the current state of the world.",
  "EdgarAdley_10157": "The Absconder's finally gone, so that's a relief. But enough of spiders!",
  "EdgarAdley_10170": "The Absconder Assassin! Pleasure to see you again. Can't tell you how happy Milo's daughter was to get that watch.",
  "EdgarAdley_10171": "You swindler. Thought you might've joined the Ashwinders by now.",
  "EdgarAdley_10172": "I'm hoping someone can retrieve an heirloom from Milo's body to give to his little girl.",
  "EdgarAdley_10173": "As a potion ingredient, Acromantula venom is incredibly valuable.",
  "EdgarAdley_10174": "In large part because it is – as poor Milo has proven – impossible to get from a live Acromantula.",
  "EdgarAdley_10175": "I do hope you haven't gone after that watch I mentioned.",
  "EdgarAdley_10176": "Wouldn't wear those myself. To each their own.",
  "EdgarAdley_10183": "Dark Arts. Well, well.",
  "EdgarAdley_10197": "Careful, now. Wouldn't want to hurt anyone.",
  "EdgarAdley_10204": "The Absconder Assassin! A remarkable thing you did there, to say the least.",
  "EdgarAdley_10211": "Hello there. Looking for something?",
  "EdgarAdley_10218": "Oh, you'll like that. I'm sure of it.",
  "EdgarAdley_10225": "I never mind replenishing my stocks. Pleasure doing business with you.",
  "EdgarAdley_10232": "You cannae afford that, I'm afraid.",
  "EdgarAdley_10239": "Oh! Suits you. I'd think about getting that.",
  "EdgarAdley_10246": "Ah, thank you for stopping by. I appreciate your business.",
  "EdgarAdley_10253": "Anything I can help you find?",
  "EdgarAdley_10260": "Er – don't mind me.",
  "EdgarAdley_10267": "Eh, not my choice of actions all things considered. But each to their own.",
  "EdmundArcher_10021": "Greetings, Professor. Always a pleasure to see you.",
  "EffieBones_10000": "You there! Can you help me?",
  "EffieBones_10001": "I need some help!",
  "EffieBones_10002": "Would you mind helping a poor witch?",
  "EffieBones_10003": "Hello? Hello?",
  "EffieBones_10004": "Can you not hear me?",
  "EffieBones_10005": "I don’t suppose a student like yourself would be in possession of such a thing?",
  "EffieBones_10006": "Oh, thank you, thank you! I knew you had a good heart.",
  "EffieBones_10007": "Well, that is unfortunate. I was hoping you'd be better prepared.",
  "EffieBones_10008": "How cruel, calling me a liar. I don't need the help of someone so rude.",
  "EffieBones_10009": "No, I – wait, did you find some?",
  "EffieBones_10010": "Nearly attacked by wolves, I was. Only just escaped with my life. I need to be better prepared next time. Could use some Thunderbrew.",
  "EffieBones_10011": "I feel better already just knowing I have some Thunderbrew on hand!",
  "EffieBones_10012": "Not a charitable bone in their body.",
  "EffieBones_10013": "Better hope the wolves don't get you. You won't receive a drop of help from the likes of me.",
  "EffieBones_10060": "Please, take this as thanks for your generosity.",

  "EldritchDiggory_10011": "Excuse me, I'd like to speak to you.",
  "EldritchDiggory_10012": "Do come and speak to me. I believe I can help you with something.",

  "EldritchDiggory_10014": "Former Minister for Magic and founder of the Auror Recruitment Programme, at your service.",
  "EldritchDiggory_10021": "A boy disappeared with those pages, but they never found the body. A girl was convicted of his murder nonetheless.",

  "EldritchDiggory_10024": "Cream of the crop when it comes to Aurors. A star pupil here and then an exemplary servant to the Ministry.",
  "EldritchDiggory_10025": "Over a hundred years ago. 1733 to 1747 to be precise. The stories I could tell you. Didn't have the chance to do all that I could.",

  "EldritchDiggory_10027": "No offence, but it's nice to get away from the students and converse with someone who's familiar with my legacy.",
  "EldritchDiggory_10028": "I shall see you there. Soon, I hope.",

  "EleazarFig_12529": "Who on earth is 'Richard Jackdaw?'",

  "EleazarFig_12564": "Do you recognise the head sculpted there?",
  "EleazarFig_12565": "And the prints carved into the ground lead me to believe that a Graphorn will somehow open the way forward.",
  "EleazarFig_12568": "I suspect you'll need to bring him here. What happens next, I can't say.",
  "EleazarFig_12569": "Now, Professor Rackham made it clear that you must engage with any beast that is part of this trial on your own.",
  "EleazarFig_12570": "Excellent. I know this area well enough. When you see the remains of a large sea creature, you're in the right place.",
  "EleazarFig_12572": "So I shall wish you good luck and wait for your return in the Map Chamber.",
  "EleazarFig_12574": "I have, yes. Years ago, at Stonehenge, of all places. The Ministry still owes me for that favour.",
  "EleazarFig_12585": "We are not. Ranrok's Loyalists. Around a dozen I can see, but could be more.",
  "EleazarFig_12587": "We could, but we've no idea what's in the tower.",
  "EleazarFig_12591": "I'm glad that's over.",
  "EleazarFig_12592": "I'd wager this mess is the fault of time, not goblins.",
  "EleazarFig_12593": "How on earth could they have known about this place?",
  "EleazarFig_12596": "Looks like we've found the entrance.",
  "EleazarFig_12642": "This place could do with a bit of pruning. Let's look around.",
  "EleazarFig_12650": "I'll be in touch.",
  "EleazarFig_12652": "You're here. I have good news – we do not have any of Ranrok's Loyalists to contend with.",
  "EleazarFig_12658": "It can be difficult, of course – they are massive, after all – but it's not impossible.",
  "EleazarFig_12690": "There you are! How did you – ? What is this place?",
  "EleazarFig_12693": "I wonder –",
  "EleazarFig_12694": "Follow my lead.",
  "EleazarFig_12696": "Someone's coming.",
  "EleazarFig_12713": "With robes like that, it could be anyone.",
  "EleazarFig_12715": "George. Glad my rather cryptic description of our location did not thwart your finding us.",
  "EleazarFig_12720": "After you.",
  "EleazarFig_12721": "Just barely.",
  "EleazarFig_12723": "Mr Osric is prone to flattery. I daresay it's one of the reasons he’s risen so far at the Ministry. (chuckles)",
  "EleazarFig_12731": "Wait. We do not know what –",
  "EleazarFig_12732": "<i>Accio!</i>",
  "EleazarFig_12741": "And you. I was hoping our paths would cross today before you immersed yourself in studies.",
  "EleazarFig_12768": "Thank you for your help.",
  "EleazarFig_12769": "I'm not sure. Sir, I wonder if you might –",
  "EleazarFig_12800": "What happened?",
  "EleazarFig_12801": "Are you all right?",
  "EleazarFig_12810": "Phineas Nigellus Black. (sigh) Prepare yourself to meet the Headmaster.",
  "EleazarFig_12813": "It appears to be a fearsome beast known as a Graphorn.",
  "EleazarFig_12814": "It would seem so. I do know that the last of a long dynasty of Graphorns lives nearby. They call him the 'Lord of the Shore’.",
  "EleazarFig_12815": "Certainly. You're to find and subdue a Graphorn that lives nearby.",
  "EleazarFig_12835": "They've set up camp just ahead. I suggest we investigate a little before doing anything else. Let's go.",
  "EleazarFig_12882": "And I you. Thank Merlin you're in one piece. I heard about the attack. Trolls – in Hogsmeade?",
  "EleazarFig_12885": "I discovered an inscription. When I read it aloud, this map appeared.  Clever enchantment.",
  "EleazarFig_12886": "It's a map of Hogwarts, to be sure, but I do not know where it leads.",
  "EleazarFig_12887": "I suspected you would see something.",
  "EleazarFig_12894": "I'll let Professor Hecat know to expect you.",
  "EleazarFig_12903": "So I hear. She tells me you've taken rather well to your new wand.",
  "EleazarFig_12905": "This will direct you anywhere you wish to go – a classroom, the Great Hall, or, should you ever require it, somewhere in the Hogwarts dungeons.",
  "EleazarFig_12907": "Unfold it and have a look.",
  "EleazarFig_12912": "Good. Don't neglect your studies. Your wandwork is improving by the day –",
  "EleazarFig_12914": "You accessed the Restricted Section? But how – ? Thinking on it, perhaps it's best you spare me the details.",
  "EleazarFig_12918": "Professor Rackham. I look forward to meeting him. How did this 'Jackdaw' get the pages from the book?",
  "EleazarFig_12919": "I'm afraid we don't have the luxury of time.",
  "EleazarFig_12921": "Respectfully, sir, while I do not know the secret you keep, I do know that our young friend here has seen traces –",
  "EleazarFig_12922": "– traces of a powerful Dark Magic being wielded by goblinkind.",
  "EleazarFig_12924": "I know that tower. It's not far.",
  "EleazarFig_12927": "As your 'mentor', the least I can do is go ahead to make sure it is safe. Join me as soon as you can.",
  "EleazarFig_12928": "We're going to need to understand how Ranrok's Loyalists knew about a tower that once belonged to a Keeper.",
  "EleazarFig_12929": "Then I shall leave matters in your increasingly capable hands.",
  "EleazarFig_12931": "We shall defer to you in this matter, of course.",
  "EleazarFig_12932": "Well, it's worth a try. See what you can find out. Of course, don't forget –",
  "EleazarFig_12934": "I wonder why it was here. Below Hogwarts.",
  "EleazarFig_12935": "Are you all right?",
  "EleazarFig_12936": "You're hurt.",
  "EleazarFig_12937": "Take this. It's Wiggenweld Potion. That stuff'll right you in a second.",
  "EleazarFig_12938": "Poor George –  I can't believe he –",
  "EleazarFig_12939": "What the hell got into that damned thing? Attacking a carriage mid-air? A typical dragon would never –",
  "EleazarFig_12940": "I'm not sure. But that key you discovered was clearly a Portkey.",
  "EleazarFig_12941": "An item enchanted to bring whoever touches it to a specific place.",
  "EleazarFig_12942": "I would. But stay close. We've no idea who created this Portkey – or why.",
  "EleazarFig_12943": "Precisely.",
  "EleazarFig_12944": "Oh, yes. Of course.",
  "EleazarFig_12945": "Stay close.",
  "EleazarFig_12946": "Like the glow you saw on the Portkey container?",
  "EleazarFig_12947": "We were just wondering about that goblin back there.",
  "EleazarFig_12948": "That is no mere basin. That is a Pensieve – for viewing memories.",
  "EleazarFig_12949": "That's what you're seeing? The glow that surrounded them?",
  "EleazarFig_12950": "Astonishing.",
  "EleazarFig_12951": "Traces of an ancient magic, to be precise. The magic that Miriam had always believed existed but could never –",
  "EleazarFig_12952": "Miriam – and perhaps George – died in pursuit of knowledge that has been dormant for centuries –",
  "EleazarFig_12953": "And you, it seems, are the key to understanding why. We wou –",
  "EleazarFig_12954": "Ranrok.",
  "EleazarFig_12956": "I'm not giving you anything.",
  "EleazarFig_12957": "Are you all right?",
  "EleazarFig_12958": "I've never seen so powerful a goblin. He seemed wholly unaffected by my magic.",
  "EleazarFig_12959": "It can't be.",
  "EleazarFig_12960": "It seems those who set up the Pensieve, the locket – and the path to both – wanted someone with your ability to end up here.",
  "EleazarFig_12961": "Come. We've a Sorting Ceremony to get to.",
  "EleazarFig_12962": "Ah! It appears we are almost ready to depart.",
  "EleazarFig_12963": "It's a pity we didn't have a bit more time to spend on spell-casting.",
  "EleazarFig_12964": "I presume you've been practising the spells we worked on.",
  "EleazarFig_12965": "Well, I'm quite sure I've never seen anyone take so quickly to a second-hand wand.",
  "EleazarFig_12966": "You'll be a force to be reckoned with when you get your own.",
  "EleazarFig_12967": "It's been much too long. When I received your owl, I must say I –",
  "EleazarFig_12968": "Of course. Why don't we speak en route to Hogwarts? We have a start-of-term feast and a Sorting Ceremony to get to.",
  "EleazarFig_12969": "A new student.",
  "EleazarFig_12970": "It is, indeed. None of the faculty has ever heard of anyone being admitted to Hogwarts so late.",
  "EleazarFig_12971": "Of course, as the other fifth-years will have been honing their magical skills for four years now, the Headmaster asked if I could get our new student up to speed a bit before the term begins.",
  "EleazarFig_12972": "I have. Opinions differ as to how great a threat Ranrok really is.",
  "EleazarFig_12973": "Miriam? How?",
  "EleazarFig_12974": "– that she had to get rid of it quickly to keep it safe.",
  "EleazarFig_12975": "It looks like goblin metal.",
  "EleazarFig_12976": "That symbol –",
  "EleazarFig_12977": "I don't see a glow.",
  "EleazarFig_12978": "Oh, good – we haven't missed the Sorting Ceremony.",
  "EleazarFig_12979": "I'm no expert, but that seems more appropriate.",
  "EleazarFig_12980": "Now – I need to study this locket as soon as I can, but first I must contact the Ministry.",
  "EleazarFig_12981": "They need to know what happened to George – and be warned of Ranrok.",
  "EleazarFig_12982": "For the moment, I ask that you keep all that's happened this evening between you and me.",
  "EleazarFig_12983": "Thank you. Ready for the Sorting Ceremony?",
  "EleazarFig_12984": "There were – complications.",
  "EleazarFig_12985": "It seems the goblin problem has –",
  "EleazarFig_12990": "Shall we have a look?",
  "EleazarFig_12993": "Are private entrances to the bank common at Gringotts?",
  "EleazarFig_12994": "A what?",
  "EleazarFig_12995": "That waterfall washes away all enchantments. It's a security measure.",
  "EleazarFig_12996": "Heard of it.",
  "EleazarFig_12997": "Miriam’s wand.",
  "EleazarFig_13000": "Let's see some of that wandwork you were practising.",
  "EleazarFig_13001": "Focus on the centre.",
  "EleazarFig_13002": "Excellent.",
  "EleazarFig_13003": "A good question. Miriam spent years searching for evidence of a long-forgotten form of ancient magic.",
  "EleazarFig_13004": "Yes. A powerful magic wielded by a rare few – that seems to have been lost to time.",
  "EleazarFig_13005": "Hogwarts castle was built by, and is itself a stronghold of, that ancient magic.",
  "EleazarFig_13006": "I don't know where she came into possession of the Portkey. But I am certain it was to do with that search.",
  "EleazarFig_13007": "Ah, there's the path down below. This way.",
  "EleazarFig_13008": "Miriam wanted to understand why such powerful magic disappeared from the wizarding world – spoke of the good it could do.",
  "EleazarFig_13009": "But magic is no different than any power. What really matters is the one who wields it.",
  "EleazarFig_13011": "Farther from London than the carriage travelled. We're somewhere in the Scottish Highlands.",
  "EleazarFig_13015": "Good. Let's see if we can find a path – however faded it may be.",
  "EleazarFig_13016": "Mind your step.",
  "EleazarFig_13017": "Ah, up there.",
  "EleazarFig_13018": "What in Merlin's name – ?",
  "EleazarFig_13019": "Godric's heart!",
  "EleazarFig_13020": "I don't believe it.",
  "EleazarFig_13024": "Almost there!",
  "EleazarFig_13025": "<i>Reparo!</i>",
  "EleazarFig_13026": "Hmm – perhaps our host was a noted Seer. Interesting.",
  "EleazarFig_13028": "This may have been his home.",
  "EleazarFig_13029": "I suspect they valued their privacy. That Portkey led us here for a reason.",
  "EleazarFig_13030": "Let's have a look around for anything that seems – out of place.",
  "EleazarFig_13031": "That was a bit rougher than I'd expected.",
  "EleazarFig_13032": "Your wandwork's improving with every cast.",
  "EleazarFig_13033": "Steady yourself.",
  "EleazarFig_13034": "That was certainly unexpected.",
  "EleazarFig_13035": "Let me think. There must be something here. Hmm. <i>Revelio</i>, perhaps.",
  "EleazarFig_13036": "Yes. A revealing charm. No time like the present.",
  "EleazarFig_13037": "<i>Lumos!</i>",
  "EleazarFig_13040": "Stay close. There will be no Disapparating if things go poorly – not out of Gringotts.",
  "EleazarFig_13042": "Well, that's a start. There's that symbol again. I don't suppose you see a way to –",
  "EleazarFig_13043": "If what you can see reveals the way forward, then I daresay we are about to discover the secret of this vault!",
  "EleazarFig_13044": "There must be something to that reflection you're seeing.",
  "EleazarFig_13045": "Try casting <i>Revelio</i>, perhaps?",
  "EleazarFig_13046": "I presume this is what you saw reflected in the floor.",
  "EleazarFig_13047": "Hm. Perhaps you should cast <i>Lumos</i>.",
  "EleazarFig_13048": "Well done.",
  "EleazarFig_13050": "When was the last time this vault was accessed?",
  "EleazarFig_13051": "Until then. Be careful. And do not tell anyone where you're going.",
  "EleazarFig_13052": "The tower on the map. North of Hogsmeade. I'll scout things out ahead.",
  "EleazarFig_13056": "Not much, I'm afraid. I've passed it dozens of times. It's north of Hogsmeade.",
  "EleazarFig_13059": "My recollection is that it seems abandoned. Clearly, however, the tower conceals more than meets the eye.",
  "EleazarFig_13061": "Best head inside.",
  "EleazarFig_13062": "Stealthy as you can.",
  "EleazarFig_13063": "Many goblins have always been antagonistic towards wizardkind, but this is different somehow.",
  "EleazarFig_13064": "I've known my share of goblins, but have never known any so aggressive.",
  "EleazarFig_13065": "How have the goblins come to be so misguided?",
  "EleazarFig_13066": "It's a sad day, really. Their blood is on Ranrok's hands.",
  "EleazarFig_13074": "That man is exasperating. Unfortunately, our trip to the Restricted Section will have to wait a bit longer.",
  "EleazarFig_13077": "– the Portkey was meant to lead us there? I do.",
  "EleazarFig_13079": "It's not cold enough here. It appears to be a sort of enchantment.",
  "EleazarFig_13080": "Someone wanted to block this path.",
  "EleazarFig_13081": "How odd. Why would someone have conjured that enchanted stone here?",
  "EleazarFig_13082": "What room?",
  "EleazarFig_13083": "I don't see anything.",
  "EleazarFig_13084": "Another Pensieve? Godric's heart.",
  "EleazarFig_13085": "This is no ordinary vault. I suspect we will need to earn our way out of here.",
  "EleazarFig_13087": "What is it?",
  "EleazarFig_13089": "Look out!",
  "EleazarFig_13090": "Ranrok was in Hogsmeade? With Rookwood?",
  "EleazarFig_13091": "This is grave news, indeed. If Ranrok's goblins and Dark wizards are after you, they want what we found in that vault.",
  "EleazarFig_13093": "– if our experience at Gringotts, let alone what happened to Miriam, taught me anything, it's that the path we're on is terribly dangerous.",
  "EleazarFig_13094": "Perhaps we are only after a book. But we should be prepared for anything.",
  "EleazarFig_13096": "You must continue to work with her – and your other professors – to improve your skills.",
  "EleazarFig_13099": "You've done exceptionally well. I look forward to seeing all that you've accomplished when I return.",
  "EleazarFig_13100": "I imagine these brooms have been enchanted for centuries. Never seen an enchantment last this long.",
  "EleazarFig_13101": "For the moment, however, you've more important things to set your mind to. A 'reservoir of ancient magic', I believe?",
  "EleazarFig_13102": "Has something changed?",
  "EleazarFig_13103": "He knew Miriam?",
  "EleazarFig_13105": "Incredible.  All right. You'll need the password to get past the stone gargoyle. The Headmaster's house-elf will know it.",
  "EleazarFig_13106": "He is. So, you'll need a disguise. I have just the thing – a Polyjuice Potion. You'll look and sound like Professor Black.",
  "EleazarFig_13107": "One never knows when such a thing may come in handy. Let's just say I felt the need to be prepared for anything after my fruitless trip to the Ministry on his behalf.",
  "EleazarFig_13108": "Now, time is of the essence. Drink up and I shall explain more.",
  "EleazarFig_13109": "Convincing. I've taken the liberty of transfiguring your robes.",
  "EleazarFig_13110": "Leave him to me. I shall tell him we're to meet a liaison from the Ministry in Hogsmeade. That should give you plenty of time.",
  "EleazarFig_13111": "It's rather strange to hear gratitude coming from Professor Black. I'll see you there.",
  "EleazarFig_13112": "Why those memories? Hmm. Perhaps this book will explain.",
  "EleazarFig_13115": "I appreciate your enthusiasm – and I'm eager to discover what we may find there as well. But –",
  "EleazarFig_13116": "We have no choice. It would be unwise to provoke our illustrious headmaster further.",
  "EleazarFig_13117": "It seems we have no choice but to wait. Frustrating as it is.",
  "EleazarFig_13118": "I'd like you to work with Professor Hecat a bit, before we continue.",
  "EleazarFig_13119": "Once you've honed your defensive magic further, come and see me.",
  "EleazarFig_13120": "That said, I don't wish to postpone our visit to the library any longer.",
  "EleazarFig_13122": "I assume you have news regarding the goblin you mentioned. Why don't we meet at the Map Chamber to discuss that and our next steps?",
  "EleazarFig_13124": "There you are.",
  "EleazarFig_13125": "What did you learn?",
  "EleazarFig_13132": "Over here.",
  "EleazarFig_13135": "Ah, up there. That's our way in.",
  "EleazarFig_13136": "We already knew they were after you – but now we know they're digging for 'stores of magic.'",
  "EleazarFig_13139": "This must be it – the store of magic and the source of Ranrok's power.",
  "EleazarFig_13141": "Ranrok said there's more to be found. And if he's right about that, it may or may not be located here.",
  "EleazarFig_13142": "I would join you if I could. I shall await your arrival in the Map Chamber.",
  "EleazarFig_13144": "You do learn quickly.",
  "EleazarFig_13145": "Hopefully you will soon hear from Lodgok, as well, and we shall learn how he fared with the helmet you retrieved.",
  "EleazarFig_13151": "Well done today, as always. We shall speak again soon.",
  "EleazarFig_13155": "We should focus on what's ahead.",
  "EleazarFig_13156": "Let's keep moving.",
  "EleazarFig_13157": "This way.",
  "EleazarFig_13158": "Ready to proceed?",
  "EleazarFig_13159": "We should move on.",
  "EleazarFig_13160": "Let's keep moving.",
  "EleazarFig_13161": "We're close now. It's just ahead.",
  "EleazarFig_13162": "I'm not sure this mural is going to give us many answers.",
  "EleazarFig_13163": "What did you foresee?",
  "EleazarFig_13165": "Certainly an odd place to build a home.",
  "EleazarFig_13166": "You seem to have caused the floor to change.",
  "EleazarFig_13168": "Stay close!",
  "EleazarFig_13169": "Are you there? This way!",
  "EleazarFig_13170": "Lead the way.",
  "EleazarFig_13171": "That's it.",
  "EleazarFig_13172": "There you are.",
  "EleazarFig_13173": "Good.",
  "EleazarFig_13174": "Keep at it. It's important that you learn this.",
  "EleazarFig_13175": "Once more.",
  "EleazarFig_13176": "Again.",
  "EleazarFig_13177": "You'll get it.",
  "EleazarFig_13178": "Well done.",
  "EleazarFig_13179": "It's working. Be ready for anything.",
  "EleazarFig_13180": "For now, tell me what you saw in the Pensieve.",
  "EleazarFig_13187": "Happily, you have the benefit of an exceptionally skilled team of witches and wizards to guide you.",
  "EleazarFig_13189": "Speaking of 'guides' – and so that I may avoid another not-so-subtle reproof from Professor Weasley –",
  "EleazarFig_13191": "According to the owl I received, Ranrok is moving more quickly than we could have anticipated.",
  "EleazarFig_13192": "Godric's heart!",
  "EleazarFig_13193": "Professor Weasley has been keeping an eye on me. Perhaps we should meet there so she has no reason to raise concerns with Professor Black.",
  "EleazarFig_13194": "I shall send an owl ahead to Ollivander. Whilst you visit him, I'll reach out to Professor Weasley.",
  "EleazarFig_13196": "I knew it would. I may have done too good a job distracting Black. I had no idea he can't hold his Firewhisky.",
  "EleazarFig_13197": "Godric's heart. Are you all right? I know you're well able to defend yourself, I've seen it often enough – but Rookwood himself?",
  "EleazarFig_13198": "We can only hope that we're not too late, and that we find nothing but a repository, undisturbed, beyond this door.",
  "EleazarFig_13199": "I fear they may not. Although if they don't now, I can assure you – they will in the future.",
  "EleazarFig_13201": "I was. Hopefully she and the others will arrive soon. They know where to find the door through which we entered.",
  "EleazarFig_13202": "Damn. The goblins.",
  "EleazarFig_13203": "If his Loyalists are here, he cannot be far behind.",
  "EleazarFig_13204": "These tunnels haven't brought us much luck so far.",
  "EleazarFig_13205": "More of Ranrok's damned Loyalists.",
  "EleazarFig_13206": "Ranrok's plan will fail.",
  "EleazarFig_13207": "We need to press on. Ranrok must be here somewhere.",
  "EleazarFig_13208": "I shall handle it. One moment.",
  "EleazarFig_13209": "Let's go.",
  "EleazarFig_13210": "It doesn't sound like a drill.",
  "EleazarFig_13211": "Troll!",
  "EleazarFig_13213": "You fought one of these in Hogsmeade?",
  "EleazarFig_13214": "I see it. And I don't know. I can only hope they arrive soon.",
  "EleazarFig_13215": "A dead end – now what?",
  "EleazarFig_13216": "Very perceptive, my young friend.",
  "EleazarFig_13217": "Ranrok must be getting closer to finding the repository.",
  "EleazarFig_13218": "Listen – more goblins up ahead.",
  "EleazarFig_13219": "They must be on their way, but we can't stop now.",
  "EleazarFig_13220": "It looks as if they've been here for a while. They've even brought explosives.",
  "EleazarFig_13221": "You fiends don't know what you're doing.",
  "EleazarFig_13222": "Ranrok's sending you on his fool's errand? You won't succeed.",
  "EleazarFig_13223": "Now that that's settled, let's move on. This way.",
  "EleazarFig_13224": "It worked! Let's go!",
  "EleazarFig_13225": "Thank you, Professor.",
  "EleazarFig_13226": "Time to move. We're in the thick of it now.",
  "EleazarFig_13227": "Stop him!",
  "EleazarFig_13228": "I'm relieved we got here before Ranrok.",
  "EleazarFig_13231": "I suppose we should begin our search for 'a face of stone and tendrils', whatever that may be.",
  "EleazarFig_13233": "Wherever it is, we need to find it before they do. Where is that portrait?",
  "EleazarFig_13235": "You would be wise not to underestimate this student.",
  "EleazarFig_13236": "Their aptitude for magic is beyond anything I've ever seen – and I've been teaching a long time.",
  "EleazarFig_13237": "No time to waste.",
  "EleazarFig_13239": "I'll meet you at Rookwood Castle.",
  "EleazarFig_13244": "I see. Ranrok clearly knows even more than we suspected.",
  "EleazarFig_13248": "Why am I not surprised? Shall we?",
  "EleazarFig_13251": "And we encountered an uncommonly powerful goblin wielding such magic as we prepared to leave your vault at Gringotts.",
  "EleazarFig_13252": "We may already be too late.",
  "EleazarFig_13254": "An exceptional level of magical skill? Nuanced ability to interact with beasts? Hmmm.",
  "EleazarFig_13255": "I heard what you told Professor Bakar – Isidora was inhaling emotions to gain power?",
  "EleazarFig_13256": "Monstrous.",
  "EleazarFig_13258": "Ranrok is a monster. We need to know where the final repository is.",
  "EleazarFig_13259": "Speak to Professor Rackham at once. We've no time to lose.",
  "EleazarFig_13261": "I'd like to have a look around.",
  "EleazarFig_13262": "(deep breath)",
  "EleazarFig_13263": "Wait!",
  "EleazarFig_13264": "Let's see what we're missing, shall we? Ready your wand and focus.",
  "EleazarFig_13265": "I do. But to what end I can't say.",
  "EleazarFig_13266": "What statue?",
  "EleazarFig_13267": "Hello! Are you there?",
  "EleazarFig_13268": "Yes! Godric's heart – I'm glad you're all right. I'm somehow back in the entry room to the vault.",
  "EleazarFig_13269": "(sigh) Peeves.",
  "EleazarFig_13270": "Come and see me as soon as you can. I've returned from a rather unproductive trip to the Ministry. Hoping your time has been more fruitful than mine.",
  "EleazarFig_13271": "More importantly however, I'd like to know why they're here.",
  "EleazarFig_13272": "That said, be careful.",
  "EleazarFig_13273": "I don't know how much I dare say. George tried to convince the Ministry about Ranrok – but to no avail.",
  "EleazarFig_13275": "My instinct is to follow the path we are on for the moment and keep the details to ourselves until we know more.",
  "EleazarFig_13279": "Come and see me. I've discovered something in the locket we found at Gringotts.",
  "EleazarFig_13280": "Oh?",
  "EleazarFig_13281": "Ah. I'm afraid I can't take all the credit there, Professor. They've a rare aptitude for magic, it seems.",
  "EleazarFig_13282": "I wouldn't say I chose the dragon's path Professor. Rather, unfortunately, it would seem that it chose us.",
  "EleazarFig_13283": "Of course.",
  "EleazarFig_13284": "Good. Now. As capable as you are, I believe the ability you possess obliges you to be well-trained.",
  "EleazarFig_13285": "– why don't I show you the clever enchantment we included in the Field Guide's map?",
  "EleazarFig_13288": "The map is enchanted to help you find your way.",
  "EleazarFig_13293": "Now, sounds like you've quite a day ahead what with classes and a trip to Hogsmeade for supplies – including your own wand.",
  "EleazarFig_13294": "You'll enjoy Mr Ollivander. He's an exceptional craftsman and a good friend.",
  "EleazarFig_13295": "I shall reach out when I have more information about our mysterious locket.",
  "EleazarFig_13296": "For now, focus on your classes and pay attention. More than your O.W.L.s may hinge on the magic you are able to master within these walls.",
  "EleazarFig_13298": "Very handy. No time now, but if you don't learn it soon enough, we can work on it back at the castle.",
  "EleazarFig_13299": "Hm. The tower has clearly not been maintained.",
  "EleazarFig_13300": "No, it isn't. This way. And – I'd suggest we use the Disillusionment Charm here.",
  "EleazarFig_13301": "No sense in announcing our arrival.",
  "EleazarFig_13302": "Or, I suppose we could charge right into their midst. (sighs)",
  "EleazarFig_13303": "As we discussed, you'll need the password from Scrope – who could be anywhere in the castle. You might look for Professor Kogawa.",
  "EleazarFig_13304": "Goblin silver. Ranrok used it to control the dragon. But how? And why send trolls to –",
  "EleazarFig_13305": "Yes, yes.",
  "EleazarFig_13308": "You believe he can be trusted?",
  "EleazarFig_13309": "Very well. Supposing he can be trusted – will he help us get to Ranrok?",
  "EleazarFig_13310": "Well, that's something, I suppose. Supposing he can be trusted – will he help us get to Ranrok?",
  "EleazarFig_13311": "You have been busy. Let's hope your efforts result in our learning something about Ranrok's plans.",
  "EleazarFig_13313": "I suppose that's the quick way down.",
  "EleazarFig_13314": "Is there something to those symbols on the walls?",
  "EleazarFig_13317": "Goblin tracks. They're a step ahead of us. Let's see where they lead.",
  "EleazarFig_13318": "Now I'll have to take it with me to London. The Headmaster has insisted that I speak directly to the Minister about George's death.",
  "EleazarFig_13319": "What? That's – wait.",
  "EleazarFig_13320": "– but you'll want to pay attention in Herbology and Potions. There's more to magic than spell-casting.",
  "EleazarFig_13322": "Move a bit closer and try again.",
  "EleazarFig_13323": "This has not been the day either of us expected.",
  "EleazarFig_13324": "But Miriam sent that Portkey to George for a reason.",
  "EleazarFig_13325": "And I believe that she – and now George – died in pursuit of whatever it was meant to lead to.",
  "EleazarFig_13326": "If you're sure you're all right, and wouldn't mind indulging me –",
  "EleazarFig_13327": "Did I hear you and Professor Weasley talking about 'exploring ruins'?",
  "EleazarFig_13328": "Did I hear you masterfully evade Professor Weasley's interrogation regarding our late arrival?",
  "EleazarFig_13330": "We don't know where this path we've embarked upon will lead. It may require a bit more – flexibility – with your time than she would approve of.",
  "EleazarFig_13331": "And she may feel obliged to share details with the headmaster that would be better left between us.",
  "EleazarFig_13332": "I do not. Gringotts goblins aren't typically the friendliest of beings, but they have a great deal of integrity.",
  "EleazarFig_13333": "No, I daresay after what happened to that poor banker, the goblins at Gringotts are no followers of Ranrok.",
  "EleazarFig_13334": "Yes, well – Professor Weasley is a brilliant, and astute, witch. It was right to keep the details to yourself for now.",
  "EleazarFig_13335": "How do you feel?",
  "EleazarFig_13336": "Quickly now.",
  "EleazarFig_13337": "Stay hidden and cast <i>Petrificus Totalus</i>.",
  "EleazarFig_13338": "Go on. Cast <i>Petrificus Totalus</i>.",
  "EleazarFig_13339": "No time like the present for a Full Body-Bind Curse.",
  "EleazarFig_13340": "Well done.",
  "EleazarFig_13341": "It's going to take more than that to stop him.",
  "EleazarFig_13342": "I will be honest, I've no idea where to start.",
  "EleazarFig_13343": "Yes. I caught that too. Professor Rookwood said that you'd understand more once you complete the next trial.",
  "EleazarFig_13344": "An intricate carving. I'll study this for a moment.",
  "EleazarFig_13345": "Hang on!",
  "EleazarFig_13346": "Give me your hand!",
  "EleazarFig_13347": "The key!",
  "EleazarFig_13348": "Now then –",
  "EleazarFig_13349": "– that there's a connection to Victor?  Perhaps, but we can't be sure of its significance – if any.",
  "EleazarFig_13350": "Hm. Hopefully the next Pensieve provides more context. For now, we should learn what Ranrok knows.",
  "EleazarFig_13351": "These orders indicate that they're after something to do with 'names'. What names? And why here?",
  "EleazarFig_13352": "There must be something. I'll keep looking over here!",
  "EleazarFig_13353": "Professor Rookwood was right. The place is crawling with Victor Rookwood's lot and Ranrok's Loyalists.",
  "EleazarFig_13354": "They're working together, all right, but it is not a friendly alliance.",
  "EleazarFig_13355": "I'm sure you'll agree that we need to find a way in other than the front gate. Let's go.",
  "EleazarFig_13356": "Think of all the pain that created it. This is what Miriam, George, your friend Lodgok, and countless others died for.",
  "EleazarFig_13358": "After everything you've seen? What about Isidora's fate?",
  "EleazarFig_13359": "I'm pleased to hear that. I've been thinking –",
  "EleazarFig_13360": "But, this could go wrong in so many ways. You – of all wizardkind – are wholly aware of the potential cost.",
  "EleazarFig_13361": "You cannot possibly mean that. You – of all wizardkind – are wholly aware of the misery and pain that that could cause.",
  "EleazarFig_13362": "I understand. But you are not entirely alone. I will do all I can to help you.",
  "EleazarFig_13363": "I believe that is what Miriam would have wanted. We should trust in others. If anyone can rise to this challenge, my friend, it is you.",
  "EleazarFig_13364": "(angry yell)",
  "EleazarFig_13365": "Hmm?",
  "EleazarFig_13366": "Jump!",
  "EleazarFig_13367": "(exertion)",
  "EleazarFig_13368": "(sharp breath in)",
  "EleazarFig_13369": "Ah!",
  "EleazarFig_13370": "(heavy breaths)",
  "EleazarFig_13371": "You may have seen it yourself.",
  "EleazarFig_13372": "Ahem!",
  "EleazarFig_13373": "Ahem.",
  "EleazarFig_13374": "Ahem.",
  "EleazarFig_13375": "Hmm?",
  "EleazarFig_13380": "I don't know what to say. She could win over almost anyone.",
  "EleazarFig_13381": "I want to hear more of this – and, in fact, I'd like to speak with Lodgok directly. But we've no time now. Where is the next trial?",
  "EleazarFig_13382": "Incredible.  Very well. You'll need the password to get past the stone gargoyle. The Headmaster's house-elf will know it.",
  "EleazarFig_13383": "She's taken to badgering the poor elf about Quidditch in the hopes that he can convince Black to change his mind. Thus far unsuccessfully.",
  "EleazarFig_13384": "It does.",
  "EleazarFig_13385": "The repositories?",
  "EleazarFig_13386": "Five names? The Keepers. And – who else? Isidora Morganach?",
  "EleazarFig_13387": "If the Keepers won't tell you where the next trial is yet, I say we at least maintain a watch on Ranrok. Perhaps he'll lead us to more information.",
  "EleazarFig_13390": "Astonishing.",
  "EleazarFig_13391": "Well done! Their numbers are dwindling.",
  "EleazarFig_13392": "This is the last of them. For now.",
  "EleazarFig_13393": "One down, one to go.",
  "EleazarFig_13394": "We almost have it.",
  "EleazarFig_13395": "Professor Weasley has been keeping an eye on me. Perhaps we should meet there so she has no reason to raise concerns with Professor Black.",
  "EleazarFig_13396": "I shall see you near the coast.",
  "EleazarFig_13397": "I shall see you near the coast. Perhaps then you can tell me a little more about the memories of Isidora that you witnessed.",
  "EleazarFig_13398": "Of course, the bad news is that it's likely because they no longer need to track the Keepers for information.",
  "EleazarFig_13399": "If Ranrok really is going to try to drill below Hogwarts, we'll need all the help we can get.",
  "EleazarFig_13400": "It's my experience that many of your spells will have no real effect. You'll need to wear him down.",
  "EleazarFig_13402": "She did not see what the Keepers have shown you. What Isidora showed you.",
  "EleazarFig_13403": "And why are you here?",
  "EleazarFig_13404": "What do you intend to do with it?",
  "EleazarFig_13405": "(whoop) Oh. (chuckles)",
  "EleazarFig_13406": "Not with this much armour, they don't.",
  "EleazarFig_13407": "I spent all year trying to keep our journey a secret from everyone – including Professor Weasley.",
  "EleazarFig_13408": "But now I wonder if I should have shared it with her – and the others –sooner. Trusted them more.",
  "EleazarFig_13409": "The Keepers wanted this secret to be locked away forever. How long will you keep it?",
  "EleazarFig_13410": "I'm relieved to hear that. I know the power is tempting, but I'm glad you've decided to keep it contained for now.",
  "EleazarFig_13411": "And whilst that may be the right decision in this moment, I confess, I have been thinking –",
  "EleazarFig_13412": "(grunts)",
  "EleazarFig_13413": "(pained grunts)",
  "EleazarFig_13414": "Miriam –",
  "EleazarFig_13415": "– Miriam would have loved you, my young friend.",
  "EleazarFig_13416": "(yell)",
  "EleazarFig_13417": "(pained gasps)",
  "EleazarFig_13418": "(surprised gasp)",
  "EleazarFig_13422": "Late rising today, were we? No time to change?",
  "EleazarFig_13423": "I don't know Miss Onai well as she's only been with us a hair longer than you have. But she seems a bright and talented witch.",
  "EleazarFig_13424": "Miss Sweeting's on the reserved side, isn't she? However, I have noticed how she blossoms when beasts are around.",
  "EleazarFig_13425": "Charming young man, Mr Sallow. Little mischievous, but a talented wizard nonetheless.",
  "EleazarFig_13426": "Mr Thakkar seems a well-focused young man. Good to see you've found a friend in him.",
  "EleazarFig_13427": "You're not likely to meet as keen a flyer as Miss Reyes. If you've the mettle for broom flight, she's an excellent resource.",
  "EleazarFig_13428": "I'd imagine Mr Clopton is an entertaining companion – if his escapades in class are any indication.",
  "EleazarFig_13429": "Let's not travel that path at the moment, shall we?",
  "EleazarFig_13431": "Careful now.",
  "EleazarFig_13433": "If the rumours are to be believed, you've taken to increasing the beast population. Where do you find the time?",
  "EleazarFig_13434": "Still baffling to me that such a book was hidden in the Restricted Section all these years.",
  "EleazarFig_13435": "Shouldn't be surprised to have found a Map Chamber under the castle. Merlin knows what else is hidden here.",
  "EleazarFig_13436": "I'd seen Bakar's Tower countless times. Never suspected it held the secrets it did.",
  "EleazarFig_13437": "(chuckle) To this day I  get a chuckle every time I picture you as Professor Black thanking me.",
  "EleazarFig_13438": "Bit distracted, are we?",
  "EleazarFig_13440": "Now, the Field Guide can be used to guide you to the location you've marked on your map.",
  "EleazarFig_13441": "Miriam believed this forgotten magic could be used for such good. But, she did not know the risks.",
  "EleazarFig_13442": "You are now the Keeper of whatever power it holds.",
  "EleazarFig_13443": "Miriam was right. And the second memory?",

  "EvangelineBardsley_10052": "I agree. I thought it might also have been that they interrupted his hourly naps. That's all he does in his office, you know. But then I heard – can you keep a secret?",

  "EverettClopton_10735": "This can't be happening!",
  "EverettClopton_10736": "No! What can I do?",
  "EverettClopton_10737": "There. That should make you feel a bit better.",
  "EverettClopton_10738": "I'll always have your back.",
  "EverettClopton_10753": "I know you're brave, but do be careful.",
  "EverettClopton_10754": "This is no laughing matter. Keep your wits about you.",
  "EverettClopton_10755": "Are you sure about this?",
  "EverettClopton_10758": "Definitely got a way with a wand, you have.",
  "EverettClopton_10759": "Nicely done. I knew you were good.",
  "EverettClopton_10760": "Where have you been hiding that?",
  "EverettClopton_10777": "I didn't think you were capable of something like that.",
  "EverettClopton_10778": "I think I misjudged you.",
  "EverettClopton_10803": "That should get you up in the air – for now.",
  "EverettClopton_10804": "You'll outfly almost anything on that.",
  "EverettClopton_10805": "Well, I think we can make easy work of this.",
  "EverettClopton_10806": "Nothing a little Unlocking Charm won't take care of.",
  "EverettClopton_10807": "As if a lock could stop us.",
  "EverettClopton_10862": "Not good. They've seen you.",
  "EverettClopton_10863": "You've been spotted.",
  "EverettClopton_10864": "You weren't exactly being careful, were you?",
  "EverettClopton_10865": "We need to teach you how to move a bit quieter.",
  "EverettClopton_10866": "When are you going to learn to keep quiet?",
  "EverettClopton_10867": "So much for going undetected.",
  "EverettClopton_10881": "I have to say, I'm relieved that that worked.",
  "EverettClopton_10882": "That was too close for my taste.",
  "EverettClopton_10883": "This seems a tad dangerous. Might you rethink your plan?",
  "EverettClopton_10884": "I've got your back – but I'd rather you made it a bit easier on me.",
  "EverettClopton_10885": "I suppose you know what you're doing.",
  "EverettClopton_10924": "Keep your wits about you.",
  "EverettClopton_10925": "We should think about how to handle them.",
  "EverettClopton_10926": "Uh oh. That's not good.",
  "EverettClopton_10931": "You are an inordinately skilled flier. But, I knew that.",
  "EverettClopton_10932": "I knew they could fly well.",
  "EverettClopton_10934": "You on a Graphorn? Now that is not something I expected to see today. Or any day, if I'm honest.",
  "EverettClopton_10935": "They do have a way with beasts. Still – didn't expect to see them on a Graphorn.",
  "EverettClopton_10936": "If you can't find a broom, I s'pose a Hippogriff's a respectable alternative.",
  "EverettClopton_10937": "They're ruddy skilled on a broom. Not surprised they can handle a Hippogriff.",
  "EverettClopton_10938": "I heard you and Natty saved a small boy from Rookwood's. Well done.",
  "EverettClopton_10939": "You and Natty freed a Hippogriff from poachers? Brilliant.",
  "EverettClopton_10940": "You helped a curse breaker escape Rookwood? Incredible.",
  "EverettClopton_10941": "I knew you and Natty were out to get Rookwood, but I'll be honest, I didn't think you'd succeed like this.",
  "EverettClopton_10943": "You wouldn't know anything about Sebastian getting detention again, would you?",
  "EverettClopton_10944": "Oh, I like Anne Sallow. Terrible shame she couldn't come back to school.",
  "EverettClopton_10945": "I'd be careful around Ominis Gaunt, if I were you. I can't tell where his loyalties lie.",
  "EverettClopton_10962": "Too tired to put on your robes?",
  "EverettClopton_11002": "(cheers)",
  "EverettClopton_11003": "This way!",
  "EverettClopton_11004": "Just follow me!",
  "EverettClopton_11007": "Bet your life that place is haunted. Not like Hogwarts, with ghosts who read your homework – I mean unnervingly haunted.",
  "EverettClopton_11008": "'Bonesy' back there doesn't exactly inspire confidence in the place. ",
  "EverettClopton_11011": "One moment. Watch this.",
  "EverettClopton_11012": "That wasn't quite the reaction I wanted. Ah, well.",
  "EverettClopton_11033": "Here's something handy to know: lean forward for a burst of speed – helpful if you need to escape a tricky situation.",
  "EverettClopton_11037": "You sure you're not part Hippogriff?",
  "EverettClopton_11038": "That's Kogawa's whistle. This concludes our tour.",
  "EverettClopton_11039": "The tour is about to begin. Follow closely now.",
  "EverettClopton_11040": "Let's hope the Headmaster isn't having tea by the window today.",
  "EverettClopton_11042": "Ahead are the gardens. The Hufflepuff common room windows just peek out. Bit claustrophobic for my taste.",
  "EverettClopton_11051": "There's the famous bridge. Think of all the magic holding it up. I mean, look at it.",
  "EverettClopton_11052": "Leave it to Binns to make the most interesting school in the world seem dull.",
  "EverettClopton_11060": "We haven't properly met. I'm Everett Clopton.",
  "EverettClopton_11061": "I say, I watched you fly through those rings. You seem to handle yourself on that dusty school broom well enough.",
  "EverettClopton_11062": "Best hurry back.",
  "EverettClopton_11064": "Hope those Mandrakes are really relishing their new pots. Only cost me my damned hearing.",
  "EverettClopton_11065": "A bit of a detour, so to speak.",
  "EverettClopton_11066": "Sorry about that business with Kogawa, but you have to admit those views were worth it.",
  "EverettClopton_11069": "Rotten luck, that. I didn't think she'd see us. But it's no matter.",
  "EverettClopton_11071": "You seem at home on a broom. Bet if you had a fancy model you could fly laps around Imelda. She’s Kogawa's favourite.",
  "EverettClopton_11086": "This should be interesting.",
  "EverettClopton_11087": "Just have to wait for the right moment –",
  "EverettClopton_11088": "I suppose I hoped it would lighten the mood. Ravenclaws can be a bit on edge the first day of class.",
  "EverettClopton_11090": "We met in the common room. I'm Everett Clopton.",
  "EverettClopton_11091": "Hello. Nice day for a flight.",
  "EverettClopton_11095": "Our aquatic resident likes to make an appearance once in a while!",
  "EverettClopton_11096": "And the owlery. That's a solid bit of architecture, isn't it?",
  "EverettClopton_11097": "Professor Hecat is a tad dramatic for my taste.",
  "EverettClopton_11098": "Well done! Have a moment?",
  "EverettClopton_11099": "Ah, the old Boathouse! Wish you could've experienced crossing the lake as a first-year!",
  "EverettClopton_11126": "But I'm getting ahead of myself.",
  "EverettClopton_11127": "Am I right in suspecting that a Gryffindor like you might be interested in a high-flying adventure?",
  "EverettClopton_11128": "Dismount here.",
  "EverettClopton_11131": "Nice to see you, Professor Black.",
  "EverettClopton_11132": "I could show her a thing or two if I had my own broom. Hate having to return the school broom after class.",
  "EverettClopton_11133": "I recommend visiting Albie Weekes at Spintwitches in Hogsmeade. He's always looking to test new models.",
  "EverettClopton_11134": "I'll keep an eye out for you in the sky.",
  "EverettClopton_11135": "I'm Everett, by the way. You seem downright calm next to some of these characters – and you survived a rather harrowing trip here!",
  "EverettClopton_11137": "These bits of broom are all that's left of a witch called Selene Wartnaby.",
  "EverettClopton_11138": "She was never seen again. Perhaps she succeeded. I suppose we'll never know.",
  "EverettClopton_11139": "Good! Glad to hear it.",
  "EverettClopton_11140": "You needn't be worried.",
  "EverettClopton_11141": "Truly, there's no reason to be nervous. Most professors are firm but fair.",
  "EverettClopton_11142": "I mean, not all of the tricks I play are as simple as a tossed Dungbomb, and I'm still here.",
  "EverettClopton_11143": "Ha! I did. But, probably best I let you judge for yourself. I do tend to push their limits.",
  "EverettClopton_11144": "I should wander off before someone traces that Dungbomb back to me. Nice meeting you.",
  "EverettClopton_11145": "I'm fed up of being inside the castle. Wish I could transfigure something into a broom and get out of here.",
  "EverettClopton_11146": "Rumour has it she was demonstrating her experimental lunar Apparition charm.",
  "EverettClopton_11147": "Oh, uh. I shall do, Phineas. Safe travels to you – Phineas.",
  "EverettClopton_11151": "Am I right in suspecting that a Hufflepuff like you might be interested in some high-flying fun?",
  "EverettClopton_11152": "Am I right in suspecting that a Slytherin like you might be interested in making an escape from class?",
  "EverettClopton_11153": "So, care to join me for a bit of high-flying fun?",
  "EverettClopton_11154": "If I could afford the new Bright Spark broom at Spintwitches, I'd be on it now.",
  "EverettClopton_11155": "Sounds like someone's decided to get a bit of duelling practice in before Professor Hecat's class.",
  "EverettClopton_11156": "Right now we're flying over the Transfiguration Courtyard. Lovely as ever.",
  "EverettClopton_11157": "If you can you should. Wish I could.",
  "EverettClopton_11169": "You can't get stuck in a well if you don't climb into it in the first place.",
  "EverettClopton_11170": "Something about that tree is familiar. I think it's the one from that map you found in the well.",
  "EverettClopton_11171": "Following floating candles into the Forbidden Forest? Of course, nothing bad ever happens in the Forbidden Forest.",
  "EverettClopton_11172": "We got what we came for.",
  "EverettClopton_11176": "Can't have come in here for nothing.",
  "EverettClopton_11177": "The map could lead us to a trunk full of Galleons – or a crate full of Dirigible Plums. Might as well find out.",
  "EverettClopton_11178": "New Clopton rule: follow every treasure map I find.",
  "EverettClopton_11179": "So, we found some big rocks. Now what?",
  "EverettClopton_11232": "And they say money doesn't grow on trees. Or treasure, for that matter.",
  "EverettClopton_11241": "Fine favour we'd be doing Adelaide, searching for her uncle. I'm up for it, if you are.",
  "EverettClopton_11242": "Adelaide mentioned her uncle Rowland's camp may lie near Brocburrow – past the river.",
  "EverettClopton_11243": "If this is Mr Oakes's campsite, we're in for trouble.",
  "EverettClopton_11244": "Should we be bold or discreet? There's more than one way to enter.",
  "EverettClopton_11245": "If Mr Oakes was here, there's no sign of him now.",
  "EverettClopton_11246": "Oakes is an experienced trader. He marked that map for a reason.",
  "EverettClopton_11247": "His journal left behind? This can't be good.",
  "EverettClopton_11248": "I know this castle. Can't believe it's been taken over by Loyalists.",
  "EverettClopton_11249": "Blast. A part of me hoped it'd be cheerier on the inside.",
  "EverettClopton_11250": "Boiler doors usually need to be lit to operate. This one's probably no exception.",
  "EverettClopton_11251": "That furnace could be promising.",
  "EverettClopton_11252": "Try lighting that furnace. It must be connected to the boiler door.",
  "EverettClopton_11253": "I saw a boiler door on our way down. Perhaps we should take a closer look there.",
  "EverettClopton_11268": "We've got some spectators. The trials are popular.",
  "EverettClopton_11270": "Mr Oakes was lucky. Ranrok's lot would never have freed him.",
  "EverettClopton_11271": "I saw movement higher up in the keep. We should find our way there.",
  "EverettClopton_11272": "A ladder – that's what we need.",
  "EverettClopton_11284": "We need to find the tomb near Brocburrow and place Samantha's family crest on a sarcophagus there.",
  "EverettClopton_11285": "Seems our feet haven't been cursed. That's a good sign, I suppose.",
  "EverettClopton_11286": "I was not expecting to find a troll here. Although I shouldn't be surprised.",
  "EverettClopton_11287": "Samantha will be glad to hear that the crest has been returned. I certainly hope it reverses the curse.",
  "EverettClopton_11288": "I suppose we know what happened to Mary Portman now. She was breeding the spiders.",
  "EverettClopton_11289": "This must be Aranshire. We'd better keep an eye out for spiders.",
  "EverettClopton_11290": "A ladder. Not sure I want to know where this leads.",
  "EverettClopton_11291": "That's the last of the spider sacs.",
  "EverettClopton_11292": "I hope that's the last spider.",
  "EverettClopton_11293": "Well done. I think it's dead.",
  "EverettClopton_11310": "Be on your guard.",
  "EverettClopton_11314": "Look at you go.",
  "EverettClopton_11315": "If you hadn't done that, I was going to.",
  "EverettClopton_11316": "I like it when you do that.",
  "EverettClopton_11317": "That's quite the broom. Wish I had one like that – or any broom, really.",
  "EverettClopton_11337": "What on earth are you doing? Never do that.",
  "EverettClopton_11338": "Oh, what have you done? Why would you do such a thing?",
  "EverettClopton_11340": "You ought to take that sort of attack to Crossed Wands. They'd all run in fear.",
  "EverettClopton_11366": "Those Ashwinders are ruthless. And they certainly don't seem to like you at all.",
  "EverettClopton_11367": "Those poachers! It's a good thing I was here with you.",
  "EverettClopton_11368": "That Loyalist of Ranrok's was quite the fighter. No match for you, though.",
  "EverettClopton_11369": "Never cared for spiders. I like them even less now.",
  "EverettClopton_11370": "I thought that troll might be the end of us. What a relief.",
  "EverettClopton_11395": "Don't worry. You'll be all right. I'm here.",
  "EverettClopton_11403": "Look at you up there. Might have invited me.",
  "EverettClopton_11404": "Riding a Graphorn? Don't see that every day.",
  "EverettClopton_11405": "Beautiful creatures, Hippogriffs. But not to fly.",
  "EverettClopton_11406": "I can't believe Fig's gone. Never even got to speak with him. Why do such awful things happen?",
  "EverettClopton_11407": "What could a troll possibly stand to gain by attacking Hogsmeade? What's he going to get? A new robe?",
  "EverettClopton_11408": "Never thought I'd see the day when goblins would attack Hogwarts. Will they take that into account when they give us our marks?",
  "EverettClopton_11409": "I don't know that Hogwarts has ever seen a student like you. It's incredible, really.",
  "EverettClopton_11410": "No, no. Never use that spell.",
  "EverettClopton_11412": "Are you casting at me? Why would you do that?",
  "EverettClopton_11436": "Oh, I need to watch where I'm going.",
  "EverettClopton_11437": "That did it!",
  "ExtraGhostCharacterM2_10000": "I had said I would.",
  "ExtraGhostCharacterM2_10001": "No. I'm going to ask her this time.",
  "ExtraGhostCharacterM2_10002": "Did you see that? She looked at me.",
  "ExtraGhostCharacterM2_10003": "(sigh)",
  "ExtraGhostCharacterM2_10004": "I'm going to do it.",
  "ExtraGhostCharacterM2_10005": "Milady. Would thou takest my hand in dance?",
  "ExtraGhostCharacterM2_10006": "I did it! I asked her!",
  "ExtraGhostCharacterM2_10007": "Oh, goodness – Milady! Er – might I borrow my body perchance? – Milady?",
  "ExtraGhostCharacterM2_10008": "What a handsome couple we make.",
  "Fastidio_10007": "Well, well! Finally, someone deserving of the playground I so meticulously crafted. Such a treat to have fun again in my little dungeon.",
  "Fastidio_10009": "Ah! A kindred – dare I say – 'spirit'.",
  "Fastidio_10011": "Much as I love banging about the place, it's no comparison to seeing customers' faces when I bonk them on the heads with a Chocolate Frog.",
  "Fastidio_10012": "Ugh. Pay attention. You guarantee that I can have my fun at least one day each month without fuss, I let you work the rest of the time, mostly, in peace.",
  "Fastidio_10013": "Hooray! No more of this unsatisfying banging about all day in a pitiful void.",
  "Fastidio_10018": "(laughter)",
  "Fastidio_10019": "Everyone leaves me – usually in a straitjacket – never to return. I’m starting to take it personally. I’m tired of having no one to play with.",
  "Fastidio_10020": "Ooh! Ooh! Tell you what: I’ll make you a deal.",
  "Fastidio_10021": "And now I suppose you’ll want to go.",
  "Fastidio_10022": "Aha! Finally! You, my inordinately clever friend, appear to have traversed this seemingly never-ending dungeon relatively unscathed.",
  "Fastidio_10023": "Hmm. Not really your style, is it? I suppose you're free to give it away.",
  "Fastidio_10024": "Come on. You can do better than that.",
  "Fastidio_10025": "It's all fun and games until someone – wait. No, it's all fun and games. Full stop.",
  "Fastidio_10026": "Ooh! Such a joy to have someone to play with me!",
  "Fastidio_10027": "Ah! A worthy playmate! Well done me!",
  "Fastidio_10028": "You seem to have a knack for this.",
  "Fastidio_10029": "Don't they teach you how to have fun at Hogwarts?",
  "Fastidio_10030": "You've worn me out! Well done! I had a feeling about you!",
  "Fastidio_10039": "If you can match wits with me now and agree to give me unfettered access to the shop, for say one day a month, to have a little fun, I will sign a contract –",
  "Fastidio_10040": "– pursuant to which, ahem, let me see, I will – blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, oh, yes! – leave you and your customers alone 'at all other times', et cetera, et cetera.",
  "Fastidio_10041": "You get your shop, I get my chaos.",
  "Fastidio_10042": "Sound acceptable? Excellent!",
  "Fastidio_10043": "Let the games begin!",
  "Fastidio_10045": "No. No. No. No. No.",
  "Fastidio_10046": "How enlightening!",
  "Fastidio_10047": "Hmm. I'd offer you a seat, but I'm rearranging the furniture.",
  "Fastidio_10048": "I simply adore this bloomin' place – don't you?",
  "Fastidio_10049": "I do love a good game – if I have someone to play with.",
  "Fastidio_10050": "They are enough to drive one – hmmm. What is the word?",
  "Fastidio_10051": "I see you've shed some light on things. Well done.",
  "Fastidio_10052": "Oooh! I'm afraid of the dark!",
  "Fastidio_10053": "Oh, goodness. I do hope you're having as much fun as me.",
  "Fastidio_10054": "Watch your step.",
  "Fastidio_10055": "Ooh. This one is twice as much fun!",
  "Fastidio_10056": "Look before you leap.",
  "Fastidio_10057": "What's this? A game within a game? Ooh! Ooh! Knight to H-3!",
  "Fastidio_10058": "You seem quite bright indeed!",
  "Fastidio_10059": "Ugh. I'm so very bored.",
  "Fastidio_10060": "Eeek! Hahahahaha.",
  "Fastidio_10061": "I will be a-maze-d if you can find your way.",
  "Fastidio_10062": "Brilliant!",
  "Fastidio_10063": "Lucky me! Someone to play with!",
  "Fastidio_10064": "All books and no play make one quite dull indeed.",
  "Fastidio_10065": "Pardon me whilst I move some things around. It's feeling a bit cluttered in here.",
  "Fastidio_10066": "It's always good to have a different perspective on things.",
  "Fastidio_10067": "All right, then.",
  "Fastidio_10068": "Tome sweet tome.",
  "Fastidio_10069": "Ooh! Déjà vu!",
  "Fastidio_10070": "Ahhh. How inconvenient.",
  "Fastidio_10071": "So much fun to be had! My head is spinning!",
  "Fastidio_10072": "Round and round and round you go. Where'll you stop? I – well, I honestly cannot tell you because I haven't decided yet. ",
  "Fastidio_10073": "Now you see, now you don't!",
  "Fastidio_10074": "Wonderful! I may have met my match.",
  "Fastidio_10075": "What fun! I may not let you leave.",
  "Fastidio_10076": "Well. Done. You.",
  "Fastidio_10078": "One doesn't really understand the value of an audience until one is without it.",
  "Fastidio_10079": "Ready or not!",
  "Fastidio_10080": "Third time's – charmed, I'm sure.",
  "Fastidio_10081": "Oh, this is far too much fun.",
  "Fastidio_10082": "Time to raise the stakes, so to speak.",
  "Fastidio_10083": "Where oh where shall I put this?",
  "Fastidio_10084": "Catch as catch can! But can you? Catch me, I mean? You can't.",
  "Fastidio_10085": "Just once try seeing things from my point of view.",
  "Fastidio_10086": "Who turned out the lights? Oh, yes. I did.",
  "Fastidio_10087": "Now that should get your attention!",
  "Fastidio_10088": "Ooh! How I love a good boxing match.",
  "Fastidio_10089": "I have to admit –  Cassandra did a wonderful job finding the perfect playmate.",
  "Fastidio_10090": "Wouldn't you? Hmm. To each their own, I suppose.",
  "Fastidio_10091": "I am a poltergeist of my word.",
  "Fastidio_10092": "I suppose all's fair in – No. No it's not. Turnabout is fair play. You'll see.",
  "Fastidio_10093": "Ooh, that tickles!",
  "Fastidio_10094": "Pleasure doing business with you.",
  "Fastidio_10095": " What fun! If I could sleep, I would.",
  "Fastidio_10096": "Must run. So much to plan. Chaos doesn't create itself, you know!",
  "Fastidio_10097": "Ta-ta!",
  "Fastidio_10098": "Oh, goody! Someone to play with. You seem a brave sort. What fun this will be!",
  "Fastidio_10099": "Oh, goody! Someone to play with. You seem to have your wits about you. What fun this will be!",
  "Fastidio_10100": "Oh, goody! Someone to play with. I sense you're not ruffled by hard work. So determined a guest will be wonderfully fun!",
  "Fastidio_10101": "Oh, goody! Someone to play with. You seem a cunning sort. What fun this will be!",
  "Fastidio_10102": "Plus, don't want you getting too comfortable for what's in store, do I?",
  "Fastidio_10103": "You know, foliage – like most living things – won't survive for long in the darkness.",
  "Fastidio_10104": "Knighty-knight! ",
  "Fastidio_10106": "Those who came before you just could not seem to escape the darkness. Will you?",
  "Fastidio_10107": "I could do this forever. Lucky you.",
  "Fastidio_10108": "For me at least.",
  "Fastidio_10109": "No!",
  "Fastidio_10110": "Hmm. You might survive a bit longer than the others.",
  "Fastidio_10111": "But you'll need more than your wits to play with me, I'm afraid.",
  "Fastidio_10112": " I thought you were different from the others. They all gave up too.",
  "Fastidio_10113": "Does it worry you that I can see you but you can't see me?",
  "Fastidio_10114": "It should.",
  "Fastidio_10115": "I think I'll keep you around a bit longer.",
  "Fastidio_10116": "Or – simply leap. What's life without a little risk?",
  "Fastidio_10117": "Do something!",
  "Fastidio_10118": "Anything!",
  "Fastidio_10119": "Ooh! You've come so far so quickly. Well done! You might be just the playmate I've been looking for.",
  "Fastidio_10120": "I do hope you enjoy my playground. I encourage you to tell everyone about it – if you make it out, that is.",
  "Fastidio_10122": "Hmm. Running in circles, are we? Perhaps you should retrace your steps.",
  "Fastidio_10123": "Oh, how nice of him to pop in!",
  "Fastidio_10124": "Well, this has been fun. Much to do, much to do. See you in a bit!",
  "Fastidio_10125": "Well done! I'll give you a moment to collect yourself, if you can. Ta-ta for now!",
  "Fastidio_10126": "What's the saying? 'Two sides to every story'?",
  "Fastidio_10127": " Unfortunately for you – both sides here are to my story.",
  "Fastidio_10128": "And you'll have to complete both to get to the end!",
  "Fastidio_10129": "Please try. If you get to the end, perhaps we can come to some sort of – 'arrangement'. I do want your shop to succeed, after all.",
  "Fastidio_10130": "Ah – you've chosen the scholarly route. You'll need more than you've learned from books to best me.",
  "Fastidio_10131": "Nothing like a relaxing moment communing with nature –",
  "Fastidio_10132": "– but I daresay it won't be enough to prepare you for what's to come.",
  "Fastidio_10133": "I was hoping you'd fall for me – but this is a bit much.",
  "Fastidio_10134": "Ha ha ha ha ha ha!",
  "Fastidio_10135": "Wait – did you say 'one, small addendum'?",
  "Fastidio_10136": "Hmm. Hmm. Would you agree to at least two days a month instead of one?",
  "FatFriar_10025": "Lovely spread. You really outdid yourself.",
  "FatFriar_10026": "Well I just think he needs a lighter touch. Bad death, you understand.",
  "FatFriar_10027": "One would think they'd be pleased to be free of the pox!",
  "FatFriar_10028": "Yes, it's rather best you don't ask her about that. A bit touchy.",
  "FatFriar_10029": "I think the man's simply misunderstood, if you set aside the obvious murder –",
  "FatFriar_10030": "They always take it away at the end of the feasts before it has a chance to even get the slightest bit mouldy.",
  "FatFriar_10031": "Marvellous what they can do these days. Still, I do feel children used to get more fresh air back in my day.",
  "FatFriar_10032": "Ah, but that was all well before the International Statute of Secrecy. I heard the stake was quite pleasant.",
  "FatFriar_10033": "Ah, you say that, but get between a Hufflepuff and their dinner –",
  "FatFriar_10034": "No, no, it's the first-year Muggle-borns. The looks on their faces! Such a delight.",
  "FatFriar_10035": "Perhaps if I just put my face in it –",
  "FatFriar_10036": "They don't rot it like this anymore.",
  "FatFriar_10037": "Won't you look at that spread.",
  "FatFriar_10049": "(Laughs) I, of all ghosts, understand the desire to be comfortable.",
  "FatFriar_10055": "You'll be in front of the Headmaster if you keep that up!",
  "FatFriar_10069": "Hogwarts is safe at last. I never lost faith. Not for one moment.",
  "FatFriar_10076": "I shall assume that was simply practice.",
  "FatFriar_10083": "Oh! One would think I'd be accustomed to that by now.",
  "FatFriar_10090": "Out and about so late? Searching for a morsel, perhaps?",
  "FatFriar_10096": "Why hide your light under a bushel, after all?",
  "FatFriar_10102": "Come now. Such disruption can spoil one's appetite.",
  "FatimahLawang_10000": "I don't mind the troll. I simply stay out of his way, and so far, he's stayed out of mine.",
  "FatimahLawang_10001": "I suppose it's good news that the troll stealing from everyone in Keenbridge is no more. But, he was rather good for business.",
  "FatimahLawang_10002": "Nice to meet you as well. I'm Fatimah Lawang. Welcome to my shop. Anything I can help you with?",
  "FatimahLawang_10003": "Likewise. What can I help you with today?",
  "FatimahLawang_10004": "What would you like to know?",
  "FatimahLawang_10005": "You've likely heard talk of the thieving troll that unfortunately settled in the area.",
  "FatimahLawang_10006": "You may have heard the good news that the infamous thieving troll has been dispatched. And none too soon if you ask me.",
  "FatimahLawang_10007": "I've only been here a few years. Used to sell my wares as I travelled. It was an exhausting life, but I never minded it.",
  "FatimahLawang_10008": "Potions. I brew each one myself using only the finest ingredients. I assure you, you won't find their equal anywhere – even in Hogsmeade.",
  "FatimahLawang_10010": "Of course. Please, let me know if you find anything that interests you. And thank you for stopping by.",
  "FatimahLawang_10011": "Been terrorising people. Robs all who pass by.",
  "FatimahLawang_10012": "So, you'd be wise to remain vigilant whilst travelling near Keenbridge.",
  "FatimahLawang_10013": "You would not want to come face to horrid face with that monstrous thing.",
  "FatimahLawang_10014": "Was a time I believed that the troll's presence was good for business – folks were more likely to purchase my potions if he took theirs.",
  "FatimahLawang_10015": "But I must confess that the absence of that monster is likely to make Keenbridge a far more welcoming place for travellers and explorers alike.",
  "FatimahLawang_10017": "One day my travels brought me through Keenbridge. I fell in love. Though my travels continued, my heart remained here.",
  "FatimahLawang_10018": "So I eventually returned and opened this shop. Been here ever since.",
  "FatimahLawang_10019": "I shall live out my days here in Keenbridge if I have any say in it – which I suppose I do.",
  "FatimahLawang_10021": "Hmm. Well – I suppose that will do.",
  "FatimahLawang_10026": "That Pippin should have been here by now.",
  "FatimahLawang_10027": "Always late, that Pippin.",
  "FatimahLawang_10028": "Ha! Sent a child to do his work for him, did he?",
  "FatimahLawang_10029": "Always cutting corners and taking the easy way out.",
  "FatimahLawang_10030": "Did he have you brew them for him as well?",
  "FatimahLawang_10031": "Doesn't matter. You could probably do it better than he can anyway.",
  "FatimahLawang_10035": "You think it's so simple?",
  "FatimahLawang_10037": "I know Pippin is always trying to cheat his customers –",
  "FatimahLawang_10038": "– cutting corners to save some Galleons for himself at the expense of quality.",
  "FatimahLawang_10039": "You'll not be getting a Knut out of me until you prove the potion works.",
  "FatimahLawang_10040": "Drink it.",
  "FatimahLawang_10041": "Ha! Not a chance! That ne'er-do-well had his shop handed to him. The rest of us had to make our own way.",
  "FatimahLawang_10042": "I'll not give him the benefit of my hard work and gumption. If he fails on his own, so be it.",
  "FatimahLawang_10043": "You do that.",
  "FatimahLawang_10046": "I should think so.",
  "FatimahLawang_10047": "I do insist.",
  "FatimahLawang_10048": "It would seem I have more and more customers who are trying to stay out of sight.",
  "FatimahLawang_10051": "You can simply imagine the stress I'm under to deliver quality products. Unlike some vendors, I strive to keep my customers satisfied.",
  "FatimahLawang_10052": "Thank you, again for delivering those potions. Hopefully Pippin's quality will meet mine and my clients' expectations.",
  "FatimahLawang_10055": "I'm not one to judge.",
  "FatimahLawang_10057": "Well, I can't speak for all of them, but certainly my Ashwinder customers have their reasons.",
  "FatimahLawang_10058": "If I were you, I'd forget I heard that.",
  "FatimahLawang_10059": "Night clothes? Hm – unusual choice.",
  "FatimahLawang_10060": "You're the student who returned Agnes Coffey's Niffler, aren't you? She was so relieved. Good of you to do that.",
  "FatimahLawang_10061": "That spell is unacceptable. You know that.",
  "FatimahLawang_10063": "I'd prefer it if you didn't cast that in here.",
  "FatimahLawang_10064": "Hello there! Welcome to my shop.",
  "FatimahLawang_10065": "A fine choice. Exactly what I would have chosen.",
  "FatimahLawang_10066": "This will do just fine. Thank you.",
  "FatimahLawang_10067": "A bit short on money, I see. Can't help you there, I'm afraid.",
  "FatimahLawang_10068": "Thank you for stopping in. I appreciate it.",
  "FatimahLawang_10069": "What are we looking for today?",
  "FatimahLawang_10070": "Pardon me.",
  "FatimahLawang_10071": "Wasn't expecting that.",
  "FatLady_10001": "Password?",
  "FatLady_10002": "You may enter.",
  "FatLady_10004": "When will the first-years understand? No password, no entrance. ",
  "FatLady_10005": "Looking a bit scruffy today, aren't we?",
  "FatLady_10006": "What I wouldn't give for a pint of sweet, golden mead.",
  "FatLady_10007": "I'm hearing good things about you.",
  "FatLady_10008": "Someone has evidently been excelling in class. Well done.",
  "FatLady_10009": "I wonder what Violet's up to? I could use a bit of a respite from this frame.",
  "FatLady_10010": "Waking me up at all hours! When will these students let me sleep?",
  "FatLady_10011": "You'd better hurry. I'm sure you're late for something.",
  "FatLady_10012": "Many of your parents were Gryffindors. Oh, the stories I could tell you.",
  "FatLady_10013": "You stay in your portrait and I'll stay in mine.",
  "FatLady_10014": "Hmmph. What? Who's there? ",
  "FatLady_10015": "Always something to celebrate around Hogwarts. ",
  "FatLady_10016": "Monk wine is not my favourite, but it will do in a pinch.",
  "FatLady_10017": "Mmm. I am craving a hearty Heathen Cake. Perhaps with a nice golden mead.",
  "FatLady_10018": "You try coming up with clever passwords day in and day out. Not as easy as it looks.",
  "FatLady_10019": "No password, no entrance.",
  "FatLady_10020": "As I was telling Violet just the other day, it is a joy to see young scholars on their way to broaden their minds.",
  "FatLady_10021": " Students ought to have a strict schedule. No more of this waltzing in and out of the tower at all hours.",
  "FatLady_10022": "Wha – ? Merlin's beard. I was in the midst of a lovely dream. ",
  "FatLady_10023": "Settling in well, I hear. Not surprised, not surprised.",
  "FatLady_10024": "Oh I understand. Run out of Cauldron Cakes, have they?",
  "FatLady_10025": "Lovely to see you.",
  "FatLady_10026": "Such a treat to have you here. Off you go, then.",
  "FatLady_10027": "The password for today is, 'Please go away.'",
  "FatLady_10028": "I see we dressed up for the occasion.",
  "FatLady_10029": "Can't you go and grace your presence somewhere else.",
  "FatLady_10031": "Ugh. Always one pleb to spoil it all.",
  "FatLady_10032": "Ladies don't snore. I would have been dreaming. And my nostrils are small.",
  "FatLady_10033": "If you're here for me to sing, I'm not prepared. There. Requests?",
  "FatLady_10034": "Courted by all, I was. My voice, they said. ",
  "FatLady_10035": "Enchanting, they said of my song. They cried, 'Stop, before we drown in your symphony.'",
  "FatLady_10036": "Ugh. No, no, why don't you come and light a bonfire while you're at it.",
  "FatLady_10037": "Who's disturbing my beauty sleep? I'm so – delicate.",
  "FatLady_10038": "(Singing)",
  "FatLady_10039": "(Singing)",
  "FatLady_10040": "(Singing)",
  "FatLady_10041": "(Singing)",
  "FatLady_10042": "(Singing)",
  "FatLady_10043": "(Singing)",
  "Feenky_10016": "Yes! Feenky. You came for that rotten roast beef for Nick.",
  "Feenky_10038": "The Headmaster's house-elf Scrope sometimes sneaks into the kitchen late at night to pilfer a morsel. We look the other way.",
  "Feenky_10040": "Feenky supposes Nick's tired of loitering about simply to experience the faintest memory of the taste of food.",
  "Feenky_10042": "Happy to help – and to meet you as well. Please give Nick Feenky's regards.",
  "Feenky_10043": "Ah – Nick sent you, didn't he? Please help yourself.",
  "Feenky_10045": "Feenky supposes not. However, Feenky has had the best luck with the many recipes left by Helga Hufflepuff.",
  "Feenky_10046": "Her quince pie has always been a favourite. But the newfangled Arbroath smokies are becoming popular as well.",
  "Feenky_10047": "What can Feenky get for you? A pumpkin pasty? Perhaps some Welsh rabbit?",
  "Feenky_10048": "Oh! A student? What a treat.",
  "Feenky_10049": "Goodness no! Not even house-elves can conjure food out of thin air.",
  "Feenky_10050": "We can, however, multiply it, transform it, and, of course, prepare it. Then we send it straight up to the Great Hall.",
  "Feenky_10051": "There's nothing that lifts Feenky's spirits more than the company of students.",
  "Feenky_10052": "We so rarely get visitors. And we have plenty of treats. Come back any time you please.",
  "Feenky_10054": "Food is one of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp’s Law of Elemental Transfiguration.",
  "Feenky_10055": "You can take it to him now, of course. But feel free to linger as long as you'd like.",
  "Feenky_10056": "Well, since you asked, students aren't supposed to be in the kitchens. But Feenky doesn't mind.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10018": "It's an outrage! No one makes a fool of Ferdinand Octavius Pratt!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10020": "The Ministry will hear about this! The fiends will rot in Azkaban!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10021": "I demand to be released this instant! Do you hooligans hear me? This instant!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10022": "Don't think I can't hear you nattering nitwits out there – plotting my demise!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10023": "I demand to be moved to a prominent location! Do you hear me? Nothing less than a drawing room, and I mean it!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10024": "Do you have any idea who I am? You cannot hold me here – there's not a velvet curtain in sight!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10030": "All right? Do I look 'all right'? I've been kidnapped!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10031": "Somebody, help! I've been kidnapped!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10040": "She and her friends were moaning about me, of all the nerve! Then I heard her plot to enlist a gang of good-for-nothings to have me stolen from the Three Broomsticks!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10065": "Off you go then!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10090": "I need someone to find my missing frame! It's been stolen! From what I saw, it's somewhere near the coast.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10114": "You'll rot for this! Leaving me in here with your – unsanitary clutter! Get me out!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10116": "You! Take me out of here, immediately! You'll be sorry if I catch a flea! Are you listening to me? Get me out!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10118": "You there! Are you deaf? There's a terrible draught in here going straight up my pantaloons!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10119": "Now, don't just stand there! I need to be back by cocktail hour. The place'll be like a funeral without me.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10120": "Be sure to carry me carefully, won't you? My pantaloons are already creased.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10122": "Finally! Back on my wall and more angelic than ever –",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10124": "As a show of goodwill, I'll exclude whatever misdeeds I hear about you in my reports to the headmaster – and I do hear quite a bit.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10125": "Now, be off with you, I can't be seen talking to a student. Go on, then, go!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10128": "I'm not usually one to give thanks – has a sort of servant ring to it – but I suppose some gratitude is in order.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10137": "What a funny little joke. Now, the Three Broomsticks, please. They're bound to be missing me terribly.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10138": "It's all right, everyone! I'm back!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10140": "What? One frame. One – frame? Why don't you just seal me in a coffin while you're at it!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10141": "I should think you'd have better things to do – like returning my frame! Instead you let it languish with your awful filth.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10143": "I demand an apology right this instant!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10144": "Wh – what did you just say? What cruel demon lurks in your hallows that you spew forth the word – 'chap'?",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10145": "What are you doing still carting my frame about? Look at me when I'm speaking to you!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10146": "I demand that my frame be returned to the Three Broomsticks immediately! Please?",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10147": "Oh, please. Just please take me back to the Three Broomsticks. I swear I shall die of boredom wherever it is you're keeping me.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10150": "And by students no less! They paid filthy thieves to steal my other frame!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10153": "Oh! I do also recall seeing the coast on the way.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10157": "As if I can afford not to be at my post! I do important work for the Headmaster, and I need my other frame back at the Three Broomsticks!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10162": "What is the meaning of this? This isn't the Three Broomsticks!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10164": "Did you fall into a cauldron of Stupid Potion? You've brought me to the wrong place! It's absolutely vile in here!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10169": "Please, you can't leave me here! Squalor does terrible things for my complexion!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10170": "This is an outrage! Do you hear me? An outrage!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10171": "Please! You can't use me as target practice anymore!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10174": "That's where my other frame hung. Hovel of a place, though I suppose one could do worse.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10175": "Well, it's about time! It's a wonder there's anything left of me!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10176": "I once knew a portrait who ended up in the Hog's Head – no one's heard from him since.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10178": "There I was, powdering my wig, and the next thing I knew I was being manhandled by rogues and carried off.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10180": "Ah, yes –",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10182": "Calm down? Those buffoons outside have been talking about burning me! Me!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10201": "Let's just say I overhear quite a bit in Sirona's fine establishment, and the Headmaster likes to know all about it.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10202": "He's come to count on me in this regard. Reminds me of my prefect days. ",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10204": "I most certainly can! They brought me to a ruin of all places! Some crumbling atrocity surrounded by water from the sound of it.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10207": "What are you, a troll? All your heavy stamping about is going to damage my frame!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10208": "I must protest! This is no place for polite company! Not with the horrors you keep in here.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10209": "Where have you put me? It's pitch black in here! I shan't stand for this!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10210": "If they weren't all sharing half a brain, they'd realise I'm worth more to them intact and at the Three Broomsticks.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10211": "I'd like to see you try!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10214": "Have you lost your puny, little mind! This is a rare rosewood frame! Come back here!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10215": "Get back here and undo this sacrilege. Do you have any idea who I am?",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10216": "Help! A heinous crime has been committed against me!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10217": "The Headmaster? Where could he be going?",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10218": "Oh, would you? How marvellous! Do it quickly though, won't you? The place they took me to is quite beneath me.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10220": "What on earth do you mean?",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10221": "With everything I overhear? I'm a veritable trove of information!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10222": "Well, don't just stand there! Find a way to open the door!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10223": "Please, you can't mean to leave me here. Please.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10224": "Bastards.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10225": "Well 'awful' is exactly what Astoria Crickett is. She's behind all of this.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10226": "Of course it happened! I heard it straight from the horse's mouth! She is a rather horse-faced girl, that Astoria Crickett.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10227": "I can only assume they took my frame in some misguided attempt to punish me for doing my job.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10228": "It's my other frame! It's been stolen!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10229": "She's a fourth-year troublemaker, that's who. She and her band of hoodlums discuss all sorts of misdeeds right under my nose and then resent me for overhearing them.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10230": "I would hope so! Now, the Three Broomsticks, please. They're bound to be missing me terribly.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10231": "What sort of question is that? Of course I'm right here! I've more than one frame. Do you only have one home?",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10232": "Be sure to carry me carefully, won't you? My pantaloons are already creased.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10233": "(sniff sniff) Are you – are you burning me? (cough) No! Noooooooooooooo!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10234": "I do not belong in this awful place! (sniffle) I can practically smell the despair.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10235": "Lovely to be back at the Three Broomsticks. (sigh) I can practically taste the Butterbeer.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10236": "I shall never forget the horror of witnessing the cruel destruction of my other frame. No appreciation for art.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10237": "Pyjamas in public – how delightfully gauche.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10238": "Ooh – somebody knows a naughty spell.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10240": "Ooh – that will definitely be a detention.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10241": "Shouldn't you be getting some beauty sleep? I daresay you need it.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10242": "You there! You aren't allowed to walk that fast in the halls!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10243": "A third frame would be nice. Perhaps in pride of place in the Great Hall?",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10244": "You there! Is my wig a little crooked? Oh, never mind, I'm sure it's divine.",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10245": "If you're going to shine that thing in my face at least get my good side!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10246": "Must you clomp about like that? I'm trying to sleep!",
  "FerdinandOctaviusPratt_10247": "I wonder what the Headmaster would say if he knew what you were doing.",

  "FlorenceGreen_10542": "Door's always open. You be sure to stop by soon.",
  "FlorenceGreen_10543": "Well, what say we show you some of what's available?",
  "FlorenceGreen_10544": "Oh, wasn't sure I'd see any more tonight. Come on in.",
  "FlorenceGreen_10545": "Set your eyes on anything interesting? dittany seeds perhaps?",
  "FlorenceGreen_10546": "Ahem. Try that with a Mandrake.",
  "FlorenceGreen_10547": "Need the likes o' you around when I'm cracking up dried soil.",
  "FrancisDoyle_10015": "They say you rode a full-grown Graphorn. (laughs) I'd have to see it to believe it.",
  "FrancisDoyle_10018": "Is it true what they're saying? That you and Natty – on the backs of Hippogriffs?",
  "Garnuff_10025": "Most decidedly yes! My precious Mooncalf, Biscuit, was abducted by poachers up north – the vicious brutes.",
  "Garnuff_10027": "I tried to fight back but I was no match for them.",
  "Garnuff_10028": "Oh, my poor Biscuit! I can only hope she's able to escape.",
  "Garnuff_10029": "How kind. If only all of wizardkind was as gracious to goblins.",
  "Garnuff_10031": "If you do see her and can bring her safely home to me, I promise to reward you for your efforts.",
  "Garnuff_10032": "I have no idea! Mooncalf dung's highly valuable for fertilising magical plants – but I cannot imagine poachers care much about gardening.",
  "Garnuff_10033": "Poachers kidnapped her and I'm terrified of what plans they may have in store for her.",
  "Garnuff_10037": "Oh, my dear Biscuit.",
  "Garnuff_10038": "Don't you fret, Biscuit. I shall sort something out.",
  "Garnuff_10039": "What will I do without her?",
  "Garnuff_10040": "Do keep an eye out for her. And be careful out there. Poachers are an unscrupulous lot.",
  "Garnuff_10041": "You have? Is she hurt? Was she frightened? Are you all right?",
  "Garnuff_10042": "Oh, mercy. Where poachers are concerned I tend to expect the worst.",
  "Garnuff_10043": "Oh, perish the thought! Thank Merlin you were able to save her in time.",
  "Garnuff_10044": "I cannot wait to get her home. I so miss seeing her dance in the evenings. Such joy.",
  "Garnuff_10045": "That is a great weight off my mind.",
  "Garnuff_10046": "I – of course. I would pay any amount for the safety of my dear Biscuit.",
  "Garnuff_10047": "Oh, my sweet little Biscuit. My wise, noble Mooncalf. And here is your reward, of course. Well-deserved.",
  "Garnuff_10048": "Any luck finding my Biscuit?",
  "Garnuff_10049": "You've restored at least a modicum of my faith in wizardkind. Biscuit and I can't thank you enough.",
  "Garnuff_10050": "I can only hope she escapes, or that some kind soul rescues her.",
  "Garnuff_10060": "I couldn't give a Doxy what happens to those poachers, as long as my little Biscuit makes it home safe.",
  "Garnuff_10061": "Garnuff. Just Garnuff. I'm only one goblin, and not a particularly brave one at that. I have no chance against a pack of bloodthirsty poachers.",
  "Garnuff_10063": "Mooncalves are often thought of as silly, simpleminded creatures. But I've seen great depth of character in Biscuit.",
  "Garnuff_10064": "I wouldn't trade her for a Hippogriff or hippopotamus, or even a goose that lays golden eggs!",
  "Garnuff_10065": "Who knows what they'll do to her? She could be flogged, skinned, gutted and stuffed! I assume. Oh, Biscuit.",
  "Garnuff_10066": "She followed me one evening. Wouldn't leave my side. Never thought I was one for a pet of any kind, but now I can't imagine life without her.",
  "Garnuff_10067": "What? No! You can't take my Biscuit from me! What will I do without her?",
  "Garnuff_10068": "As I said before, you have restored my faith in wizardkind.",
  "Garnuff_10069": "Perhaps Ranrok was right about wizardkind. Always thinking yourselves superior to others.",
  "Garnuff_10070": "What shall I do without Biscuit?",
  "Garnuff_10071": "You! I'll have you know my life is nothing without Biscuit. And you should watch your back from what I've heard.",
  "Garnuff_10072": "Biscuit and I couldn't be happier, thanks to you. She's safe at home and that is where she will stay.",
  "Garnuff_10073": "May I never be so unfortunate as to cross paths with you again.",
  "Garnuff_10074": "Flying. Hmph. Not for me.",
  "Garnuff_10075": "Beasts don't exist for the service of wizardkind.",
  "Garnuff_10076": "As if a Hippogriff wants to by ridden by a human. Shameful.",
  "Garnuff_10077": "Beasts are lucky, aren't they? Not having to worry about dress.",
  "Garnuff_10078": "Trolls attacking Hogsmeade? There's only so much unjust treatment our beasts can take.",
  "Garnuff_10079": "I wonder if Ranrok had any good intentions? We shall never know.",
  "Garnuff_10080": "Whatever that is, I felt it right through my bones.",
  "Garnuff_10082": "Now, now. I don't deserve a fate met by the end of your wand.",
  "Garnuff_10083": "My dear Mooncalf Biscuit is back. Oh, what a relief.",
  "Garnuff_10084": "Never thought I could miss a little Mooncalf so much. Oh my poor Biscuit, where are you?",
  "Garnuff_10085": "Pardon me.",
  "Garnuff_10086": "I know of better causes to direct one's violence.",

  "GarrethWeasley_10768": "Oh, Professor, yes of course. All sorts of places I'd rather be right now. Uh, do you need something from me?",
  "GarrethWeasley_10769": "Ah, the little one-eared fellow? I saw him heading to the Great Hall moments ago. Muttering on about your – uhm – sterling graces, sir.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10771": "What? But, sir, I haven't been anywhere near Honeydukes. I – ",
  "GarrethWeasley_10772": "I thought I heard the Headmaster approaching.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10773": "What could the Headmaster want?",
  "GarrethWeasley_10776": "Well there's one for my diary.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10777": "Puffskeins are fond of bogies. It's brilliant to catch someone by surprise with one.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10781": "Professor Shah's just about as cold and distant as the bloody stars she wants us to chart. Not how I wanted to spend my evening.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10785": "I was only testing a new recipe in a mostly empty classroom. And the fire was put out quick enough.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10786": "Agreed. Innovators like us are unappreciated in our time.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10787": "Can't let the doubters sway me. When they taste my latest brew, they'll forget their criticisms and the fires. It'll be bigger than Butterbeer.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10788": "That's exactly what aunt Matilda said.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10789": "Oh, that gives me an idea! Better write it down. Best of luck to you!",
  "GarrethWeasley_10791": "Hello. You're the new fifth-year. Pleased to meet you. I'm Garreth Weasley.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10792": "I am. She's my aunt.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10793": "The opposite actually.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10794": "You'd think so, wouldn't you.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10795": "Aunt Matilda tends to treat me as if I'm a first-year. Keeps too close an eye on me. It's all a bit suffocating, to be honest.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10796": "Pleasure to meet you as well. Good luck today.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10797": "Hey. It's me, Garreth. Do you have a moment?",
  "GarrethWeasley_10798": "I was hoping you might want to redeem yourself for not having brought me that Fwooper feather in Potions.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10804": "The passage is hidden behind the statue of a one-eyed witch in the third-floor corridor. Just tap it with your wand and say 'Dissendium'.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10823": "Did I hear Professor Sharp say that you have permission to go into his office?",
  "GarrethWeasley_10824": "Brilliant! You, my friend, have been presented with an extraordinary opportunity.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10825": "Listen, anyone with a troll-sized brain can brew an Edurus Potion. I'm working on something that's certain to be spectacular.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10826": "I'm just missing one tiny, last ingredient that will add that extra spark.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10827": "You're as clever as I'd hoped.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10828": "I simply need a single Fwooper feather. As you'll already be in Sharp's office with his permission, perhaps you could grab it for me.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10831": "Wait until you see what I'm brewing. Hurry back to me when you have the feather.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10832": "Over here.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10833": "Come here for a moment.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10834": "Brilliant. Thank you. This is going to take a moment to brew.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10835": "You should get back to brewing your Edurus Potion and I'll tell you when this concoction's finished.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10837": "Finished. This is going to be brilliant.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10838": "Dragon dung. What happened?",
  "GarrethWeasley_10842": "I'd better clean up. You should finish brewing your potion if you haven't already.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10844": "Thanks to you! Wasn't precisely what I had in mind, but it was still brilliant. I appreciate your help.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10853": "You won't. Fwooper feathers aren't that valuable. Sharp won't even miss it.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10854": "Sure you don’t want to try it?",
  "GarrethWeasley_10855": "Brewed it myself.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10856": "Here. Have a sip. Go on.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10857": "Still, she means well. And she's an incredibly powerful witch. She'll have your back.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10859": "More than you'd think. Most people assume I can't get into trouble or be given detention, but – they're wrong.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10863": "Wasn't expecting that literally to blow up in my face. It was rather brilliant, though.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10866": "Wait, it's not supposed to – ",
  "GarrethWeasley_10867": "Brilliant! And it matters because you can be a part of something truly creative.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10868": "I assure you he won't. Fwooper feathers aren't that valuable.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10870": "You remember me, don't you? Garreth Weasley.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10871": "I'm Garreth, by the way. Garreth Weasley. Bit of a prodigy with potions, if I do say so myself.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10881": "Hm? Oh, no. I've been perfecting a recipe I came up with over the summer.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10882": "I'm almost there. Based on some reactions, it may need a bit more work.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10885": "I hope Sharp wasn't too disagreeable when you handed in your potion. Heard him talking about 'taking responsibility.'",
  "GarrethWeasley_10886": "Cheers to that. He probably had a good chuckle after we left.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10887": "Sharp may seem gruff, but I'd bet a few Galleons he blew up a potion or two in his day.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10888": "Sorry to hear that. Hopefully he's already forgotten about it.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10890": "Best be off. Next time we talk, I promise: fewer explosions.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10894": "You'll like it. Trust me.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10895": "It'll be the next Butterbeer.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10896": "I would really like someone to try it.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10897": "I understand. I'll sort something else out.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10898": "And now we add the mallowsweet, and – that's odd. What's happening?",
  "GarrethWeasley_10899": "Wasn't precisely what I had in mind, but it was still brilliant. Thought for certain you'd have helped.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10901": "I think it's good to take risks every now and again. Especially when it comes to Potions class.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10902": "His bark's worse than his bite. I think deep down he respects my 'artistic spirit'.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10903": "Heard about your travels here. Can't believe it! Glad you and Fig are all right.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10904": "So – I suspect the key ingredient in Fizzing Whizzbees is dried Billywig stings. I heard there's a store of them in Honeydukes' cellar.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10905": "Ah, brilliant. Thank you.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10906": "Not at all. It's a perfectly legitimate secret passage. I'd use it if I could.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10907": "Brilliant. Thank you. But you should know that it's not exactly quick. It's the 'secret' bit that's helpful.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10908": "You see, I have an idea for a Fizzing Whizzbee-inspired beverage, but I'm missing a key ingredient.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10909": "I'd get them myself, but my aunt Matilda has her eye on me. Thinks I need to focus on Potions class for a while – not my own brews.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10913": "It's a gift. Truly.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10914": "I've plenty of time for both. Been managing for years.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10915": "I was hoping you could follow a secret passage to Honeydukes' cellar and grab a few dried Billywig stings for me.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10917": "Fair enough. You shall be the first one to taste my newest brew if you can be of help.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10919": "You got them? Incredible.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10920": "This is brilliant. Can't wait to get started.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10921": "Course. Didn't think it would be that much trouble, but I'm happy to pay for your help.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10923": "Thank you again. I'll let you know when I've brewed my first batch of 'Fizzing Whizz-beer.'",
  "GarrethWeasley_10928": "Find the secret passage that goes from Hogwarts to Hogsmeade. Should be behind a one-eyed witch statue.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10929": "Then follow it to Honeydukes' cellar and grab some dried Billywig stings for my newest concoction.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10930": "Knew you'd come around.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10931": "I was hoping you could get me a Fwooper Feather from Sharp's office.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10932": "It's the last ingredient I need to complete my potion.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10933": "Though, I'm not certain Professor Sharp would make the connection. He doesn't appreciate my, er, creativity, as much as you might think.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10934": "Well, as I see it, there's little difference, fundamentally, between brewing a modification to Butterbeer and a Wiggenweld Potion.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10936": "Sorry, Professor.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10938": "Brilliant!",
  "GarrethWeasley_10939": "Is it true that someone from the Ministry was with you in the carriage?",
  "GarrethWeasley_10940": "Oh, didn't mean to pry. Nasty business, dragons. Again, very glad you're here.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10941": "Unfortunately, no. In fact, a few days ago she gave me a detention.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10944": "I was. After you helped me with that Fwooper feather in Potions, I reckoned you might be just the person I need.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10946": "Hello, again. Were you able to get to Honeydukes?",
  "GarrethWeasley_10947": "I can't wait to get brewing. This could be my best creation yet!",
  "GarrethWeasley_10948": "She's my aunt. Keeps too close an eye on me for comfort. (sigh) But she can't be everywhere.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10952": "Goodness. It's not as if I'm asking you to rob Gringotts. Honeydukes has more than enough, and I only need a few.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10953": "It's a sweets ingredient. They won't be missed. Trust me.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10954": "They're not for sale. And you never know when the cellar's going to be locked.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10955": "So the reliable way in – and out – is through the secret entrance.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10956": "My 'Fizzing Whizz-beer' is still brewing. These things take time.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10957": "Perhaps I can convince Amit to help me with my Potions homework – get my aunt to loosen her reins a bit.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10958": "Hello again.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10959": "What? Er – yes sir! I will! Thank you, sir. Thank you!",
  "GarrethWeasley_10962": "Careful my aunt doesn't catch you doing that.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10963": "Who needs the Hogwarts Express when you can jump on a broom.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10964": "Not sure that I have the stomach to ride a Graphorn.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10965": "How are they riding a Hippogriff? I can't even get one to bow.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10966": "Nice underclothes.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10967": "I'll miss seeing Professor Fig around. He always knew how to irk Aunt Matilda.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10968": "Trolls had better not be a village fixture now.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10969": "The goblins are much better off without Ranrok, that's for sure.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10970": "Downright chilling behaviour.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10971": "That's one way to get what you need.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10973": "Don't do something you'll regret.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10974": "How does Garreth's Subterranean Concoction sound? Too obtuse?",
  "GarrethWeasley_10975": "Not sure why I should have to pay for Fizzing Whizzbees from a tunnel that anyone could have found, but oh well.",
  "GarrethWeasley_10976": "Careful, there's a me here.",
  "GeorgeOsric_10118": "Oh! Eleazar!",
  "GeorgeOsric_10120": "Best not speak here, Eleazar, hm?",
  "GeorgeOsric_10126": "New?",
  "GeorgeOsric_10127": "How extraordinary.",
  "GeorgeOsric_10129": "Professor Fig is not only an exceptional teacher, he is also a remarkably intuitive – and gifted – wizard.",
  "GeorgeOsric_10138": "I've Apparated to more vaguely defined destinations than this. (chuckles)",
  "GeorgeOsric_10139": "Though, I confess I may have miscalculated slightly on my first try. Gave quite the fright to some theatre-goers in the West End. (chuckles)",
  "GeorgeOsric_10140": "Wonderful idea. As long as your young charge here doesn't mind me tagging along.",
  "GeorgeOsric_10141": "Ages since I've been to the castle. Would be good to see the old pile of rocks.",
  "GeorgeOsric_10142": "Glad I caught you before you left for Scotland.",
  "GeorgeOsric_10143": "And who is your travelling companion?",
  "GeorgeOsric_10144": "Nor have I.",
  "GeorgeOsric_10145": "Well, you couldn't have asked for a better mentor.",
  "GeorgeOsric_10146": "Have you seen this?",
  "GeorgeOsric_10147": "Although I've yet to convince my colleagues at the Ministry, I believe he is a significant threat.",
  "GeorgeOsric_10148": "And it was your wife, Eleazar, who alerted me to his activities months ago.",
  "GeorgeOsric_10149": "(sigh) She wrote to me about Ranrok before she died – wondering what the Ministry knew about his activities.",
  "GeorgeOsric_10150": "Before I could respond, I received this. It was the last thing she sent me, Eleazar.",
  "GeorgeOsric_10151": "It came via her owl – but with no correspondence. I can only assume –",
  "GeorgeOsric_10152": "Presumably from Ranrok.",
  "GeorgeOsric_10153": "I cannot open it. Whatever magic protects this is powerful indeed.",
  "GeorgeOsric_10154": "Nor do I.",
  "GeorgeOsric_10155": "Merlin's beard! How did you – ?",

  "GerboldOllivander_10050": "Oh, goodness.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10051": "Looks like it's back to the shelf for you.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10054": "Yes, I think you might be the one. Here, take it.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10055": "Where are you? Perhaps you –",
  "GerboldOllivander_10057": "Ah. There you are.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10060": "Another wand, another beginning of a bright and magical future!",
  "GerboldOllivander_10061": "(gasp) Extraordinary.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10404": "Well, you're our new fifth-year student, are you not?",
  "GerboldOllivander_10405": "Merlin's. Blooming. Beard. Not again.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10406": "Oh, what am I saying? Of course you are.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10407": "A dragon heartstring wand is most powerful – and learns quickly.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10408": "Ah, phoenix feather – exceptionally rare – and a core with a strong sense of initiative.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10409": "Hmm. A unicorn hair wand is most reliable – and faithful to its owner.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10412": "How intriguing.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10415": "Curious, indeed.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10419": "I wondered if you'd be willing to do a little detective work on my behalf.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10430": "Oh, yes. It's terribly special. But not in the way you might think. It won't grant special powers to the caster. No. Nothing like that.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10431": "I must admit I have no idea. From what I can gather, he fancied himself an adventurer of sorts.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10434": "Yes. It simply must be around there somewhere. You'll have a look, won't you?",
  "GerboldOllivander_10435": "Astonishing how misunderstood the art of wandmaking is.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10442": "Oh, you've brought hope to this old wandmaker's heart. Professor Fig was right, you are a remarkable student.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10443": "Wonderful.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10444": "But it will ease the hearts and minds of the Ollivanders to know of its return. And that power is immeasurable.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10446": "Perhaps he thought that the wand had some special power simply because of its esteemed lineage.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10448": "Oho! It's the intrepid young sleuth. Well, what did you find? Was my inkling correct?",
  "GerboldOllivander_10449": "Most intriguing. Where did it all lead?",
  "GerboldOllivander_10450": "Astonishing. So he was the culprit. And – ?",
  "GerboldOllivander_10452": "In any case, you have mine and my family's thanks. At least now we know what happened. I shall tell them what I've learnt, and what you've done for us.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10453": "Ah, well. I suppose I'm not surprised after all this time. Most unfortunate, but there you have it.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10470": "It is done.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10471": "Good of you to come! My friend Professor Fig speaks highly of you – and your resourcefulness.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10473": "You see, about a century ago, an heirloom applewood wand with a fairy wing core went missing from this very shop.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10474": "Greetings. I understand you're quite the enterprising young Ravenclaw. Professor Fig tells me you found a long-lost book for him. I'd like to talk to you about it.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10476": "It is much more than a glorified errand, to be sure. I daresay you'll find my proposal intriguing. Please hear me out.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10478": "He was vague as to details, but mentioned your having tracked down a difficult-to-find book.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10479": "Oh, I sincerely doubt that. Eleazar Fig is not one for false flattery. If he believes in you, there is good reason.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10480": "My great-aunt suspected a student named Richard Jackdaw. He'd been serving as an assistant here and suddenly vanished.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10481": "Like the bird. In fact, he was known to frequent the Hogwarts Owlery. We searched there, of course, but found no wand.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10484": "One would think. However, the Headmaster does not take kindly to an old wandmaker loitering about the place. Can't say I blame him.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10485": "Also, I have perhaps been looking for too long. I feel a fresh set of eyes – and a bright mind like yours – is sure to solve this riddle.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10486": "Jackdaw was last heard tittering about some 'pages' with a map he'd stolen from Peeves. As you can imagine, the poltergeist was less than helpful.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10487": "Yes! Professor Fig sent an owl informing me that you'd be coming.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10488": "He was a bit cryptic. Said you need to have a special wand crafted. That you'd bring me the materials.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10494": "Good to see you, my young Ravenclaw friend. Allow me, once again, to express my family's gratitude.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10495": "They were pleased to learn that the wand Richard Jackdaw disappeared with those many years ago had been located –",
  "GerboldOllivander_10496": "– even if it was somewhat – unusable.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10500": "I should warn you that I've never seen a wand like this before. My suspicion – as Professor Fig implied in his letter –",
  "GerboldOllivander_10506": "A match. Your connection seemed particularly powerful. The right wand will learn from you just as you learn from it.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10507": "I would imagine so. A wand with a dragon heartstring core is capable of dazzling magic.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10508": "Indeed! Treat it well and you shall find no more dependable a wand than one with a unicorn hair core.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10509": "Of course. And a phoenix feather core is terribly selective. This will be an excellent match indeed.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10510": "And the bond between you and your wand should only grow stronger.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10511": "I'll let you get to it. Do come and see me again if ever I can be of further assistance.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10513": "Now. I received an owl from Eleazar, er – Professor Fig.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10515": "I will be honest. I have never crafted a wand in this fashion.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10516": "Repaired broken wands, of course. But this is something else entirely. Keeping me on my toes, aren't you?",
  "GerboldOllivander_10517": "I think I can work with what you've brought me. Let me see what I can do.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10518": "We did find a series of statues similar to jackdaws. I'm certain they're a clue, but I cannot figure out where they lead.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10525": "– is that it serves a unique purpose. I doubt you shall find much use for it otherwise.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10527": "Do not be surprised at your new wand's ability to perceive your intentions – particularly in a moment of need.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10528": "Now, how did that feel?",
  "GerboldOllivander_10531": "Oh, my. How extraordinary. Remarkable design.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10532": "Ah, there you are! I've been expecting you.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10533": "Always looking for trouble. In fact, after he went missing, rumour had it his ghost was seen in Hogsmeade.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10534": "Never heard much about him after that. But it seems as if his adventurous spirit may have got the better of him.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10537": "Fizzing Whizzbees, is that that new style? Marvellous.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10538": "What is the world coming to when trolls descend upon a peaceful village.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10539": "To think how close Ranrok came to victory.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10540": "I see you've learned a few things since getting your wand.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10542": "Ha, there's some Ollivander workmanship in action.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10543": "Ah, hello there!",
  "GerboldOllivander_10544": "Come in! Have a look around!",
  "GerboldOllivander_10545": "I knew I'd be seeing you again! Please, come in!",
  "GerboldOllivander_10546": "Ah, it's you! How's the old wand doing?",
  "GerboldOllivander_10547": "Oh! How nice to see you back!",
  "GerboldOllivander_10548": "Let's not trample the old man, now.",
  "GerboldOllivander_10549": "Galloping gargoyles!",
  "GerboldOllivander_10550": "What do you think?",
  "GerboldOllivander_10551": "Ah. Hmm.",
  "GhostFemaleA_00185": "(grunt)",
  "GhostFemaleA_10001": "Dead?! What do you mean 'dead'? I am insulted to my soul, completely and utterly mortified. Why, I could – I could – (scream)",
  "GhostFemaleA_10009": "Do you think I'm impressed? I don't care how many chops it took, please – leave me in peace!",
  "GhostFemaleA_10010": "What have you done? Yes, I said forever, but this wasn't what I meant at all! Well? Are you happy now?",
  "GhostFemaleA_10011": "Four hundred years, four hundred years I've been hearing this, and I've truly had enough. I simply cannot be with you any longer.",
  "GhostFemaleA_10012": "You thought? If you'd thought more while we were alive, I wouldn't be trapped here with you. Now excuse me.",
  "GhostFemaleA_10013": "And I said, 'But Nick, my dear, dear friend – you'll lose your head!' ",
  "GhostFemaleA_10014": "Quite the scandal! And her mother never spoke a word of it!",
  "GhostFemaleA_10015": "Oh, you'll never believe what I heard about the Wailing Widow –",
  "GhostFemaleA_10016": "You try convincing the Baron.",
  "GhostFemaleA_10017": "You don't need to tell me about the merpeople. I know all about the merpeople.",
  "GhostFemaleA_10018": "My dear, the cake is to die for. And probably would be, if one of the living tried it.",
  "GhostFemaleA_10019": "Well what else can you expect from centaurs? Spend all their time looking up. Never seen one trip up myself though.",
  "GhostFemaleA_10020": "Goodness, you'd think she was some sort of banshee the way she wailed. And she used to be in the choir.",
  "GhostFemaleA_10021": "I told you. Cherry and phoenix feather. Best combination there is.",
  "GhostFemaleA_10023": "If I close my eyes, I can – I can –",
  "GhostFemaleA_10024": "In all my two hundred years –",
  "GhostFemaleA_10025": "Mmm.",
  "GhostFemaleA_10027": "Oh, what fun! A student is playing.",
  "GhostFemaleA_10028": "I've never seen it played like this. How delightful.",
  "GhostFemaleA_10029": "It's not often we get mortals walking amongst us.",
  "GhostFemaleA_10103": "Hmm? Did I hear something?",
  "GhostFemaleA_10104": "Surely no one's wandering about in here at this hour.",
  "GhostFemaleA_10105": "You'd be wise to get out of here. It's not safe for young mortals.",
  "GhostFemaleA_10106": "Wandering the Restricted Section? At this hour?",
  "GhostFemaleA_10107": "I was sure I heard something. Oh well.",
  "GhostFemaleA_10108": "Must've been nothing. Just my dearly departed imagination.",
  "GhostFemaleA_10109": "A wonderful night for games.",
  "GhostFemaleA_10110": "Nothing like the feeling of a breeze through my hair. Or so I recall.",
  "GhostFemaleA_10111": "Is that what passes for style these days?",
  "GhostFemaleA_10112": "You ought not do spells of this nature.",
  "GhostFemaleA_10114": "How disrespectful.",
  "GhostFemaleA_10115": "Please mind where you're going.",
  "GhostFemaleA_10116": "Bit late for you, isn't it?",
  "GhostFemaleA_10117": "Didn't expect any living to visit after dark.",
  "GhostFemaleA_10118": "That is quite bright.",
  "GhostFemaleA_10119": "Oh, that is such a shame.",
  "GhostFemaleB_00015": "(grunt)",
  "GhostFemaleB_00185": "(grunt)",
  "GhostFemaleB_10005": "Cancelled Quidditch? You can't be serious?",
  "GhostFemaleB_10006": "I wondered about the blood.",
  "GhostFemaleB_10007": "An Animagus? Here at Hogwarts?",
  "GhostFemaleB_10008": "Surely not again. What about the Ministry? Or are they all off on their holidays?",
  "GhostFemaleB_10009": "Yes, well that will tend to happen when you take their wands.",
  "GhostFemaleB_10010": "Oh you scoundrel! And he's only been gone ninety years.",
  "GhostFemaleB_10011": "Half dragon, half chicken. I'm quite serious.",
  "GhostFemaleB_10012": "He needs to stop chasing poor Penelope. It's his fault she's dead!",
  "GhostFemaleB_10013": "Don't get me talking about the Baron. I heard it was her mother who sent him.",
  "GhostFemaleB_10014": "He behaves as if it's still 1443. The man is utterly out of control. Very nice head of hair, though.",
  "GhostFemaleB_10015": "Ooh. Just look at it. All that food.",
  "GhostFemaleB_10016": "(sigh)",
  "GhostFemaleB_10017": "Delicious, mouldy, rotten –",
  "GhostFemaleB_10018": "Keep looking. You're sure to find him.",
  "GhostFemaleB_10019": "Young Jackdaw's no match for you.",
  "GhostFemaleB_10021": "Jackdaw's head could be in any one of those pumpkins, really.",
  "GhostFemaleB_10096": "If you're a mortal, you'd best turn back.",
  "GhostFemaleB_10097": "You aren't supposed to be here. If, uh, if you are here.",
  "GhostFemaleB_10098": "Must we encounter students at all hours of the day and night?",
  "GhostFemaleB_10099": "Can't you leave us to waft about in peace? Out of here with you.",
  "GhostFemaleB_10100": "Must have been one of the enchanted books.",
  "GhostFemaleB_10101": "Nobody's there after all. Wonder my heart didn't stop with the fright.",
  "GhostFemaleB_10102": "How do ghosts with their heads while away the afterlife?",
  "GhostFemaleB_10103": "Ironic, really. Never been as level-headed as I am now.",
  "GhostFemaleB_10104": "Shouldn't you be in bed?",
  "GhostFemaleB_10105": "Where did you learn such magic?",
  "GhostFemaleB_10107": "You know it was a student who thwarted Ranrok's plans?",
  "GhostFemaleB_10108": "Are you trying to hit me?",
  "GhostFemaleB_10109": "Goodness me!",
  "GhostFemaleB_10110": "A student! At this time?",
  "GhostFemaleB_10111": "Out for a midnight stroll, are we?",
  "GhostFemaleB_10112": "Do put out that light.",
  "GhostFemaleB_10113": "Oh, dear!",
  "GhostMaleA_00185": "(grunt)",
  "GhostMaleA_10001": "I swear, it wasn't what you think, my cherub – your eyes deceived you.",
  "GhostMaleA_10010": "Please don't waste that lovely complexion on such a frown. There, isn't that better?",
  "GhostMaleA_10011": "Don't you see the romance of it all? You and I, we are the stuff of poems. Our love is the muse of a thousand rhymes.",
  "GhostMaleA_10012": "Tell me. Whisper it in my ear, I won't be upset. How could I raise an eyebrow to you of anything other than pure joy?",
  "GhostMaleA_10013": "Please, wait –",
  "GhostMaleA_10014": "We were merely musing on the state of affairs. I don't even find her interesting. She's a bore. A dreadful bore.",
  "GhostMaleA_10015": "And I told her, 'My dear, that's a troll!' Anyway, that's how she died.",
  "GhostMaleA_10016": "Oh yes, quite true.",
  "GhostMaleA_10017": "And they were only alive!",
  "GhostMaleA_10018": "Yes. Shame about the music. Still, better than the banshee quartet.",
  "GhostMaleA_10019": "The Headless Hunt? I suppose it's worth another try. Nearly headless, after all.",
  "GhostMaleA_10020": "Well frankly I can't believe he's still headmaster.",
  "GhostMaleA_10021": "Walked straight through me! They have simply no idea how rude it is.",
  "GhostMaleA_10022": "A giant? As a ghost? How fascinating.",
  "GhostMaleA_10023": "Walked through a wall. As if that's some sort of achievement.",
  "GhostMaleA_10024": "You don't see goblin ghosts flying about. Or centaurs or house-elves or Muggles. Although, there was that one time at Glastonbury –",
  "GhostMaleA_10025": "I can almost taste it.",
  "GhostMaleA_10026": "(sniffing) So close–",
  "GhostMaleA_10027": "Just a little longer.",
  "GhostMaleA_10029": "I could do that too if I had a wand. And a body.",
  "GhostMaleA_10030": "I'm glad I won't be the one to clean up this mess.",
  "GhostMaleA_10067": "What is that you're wearing? Pyjamas? Goodness.",
  "GhostMaleA_10105": "You're the valiant one I saw in Hogsmeade. Marvellous show of courage battling those trolls.",
  "GhostMaleA_10106": "Do my spectral ears deceive me? I think I heard something.",
  "GhostMaleA_10107": "Nobody's supposed to be in here.",
  "GhostMaleA_10108": "As you might  have inferred from the name, this area is restricted.",
  "GhostMaleA_10109": "Don't make me set Peeves on your tail. Out of here. It's Restricted.",
  "GhostMaleA_10110": "I do wish I wouldn't jump at every little creak. Not good for my health.",
  "GhostMaleA_10111": "Not a soul in sight.",
  "GhostMaleA_10112": "I'd say he's in over his head this time.",
  "GhostMaleA_10113": "If the headsman could only see me now.",
  "GhostMaleA_10114": "Wish I could do that.",
  "GhostMaleA_10115": "Pyjamas? A smoking jacket was the lowest I ever sank.",
  "GhostMaleA_10116": "Ooh – that's a naughty little spell.",
  "GhostMaleA_10118": "You're playing with life and death there –",
  "GhostMaleA_10119": "Don't mind me. It's not as if I deserve dignity in death!",
  "GhostMaleA_10120": "Shouldn't you be in bed?",
  "GhostMaleA_10121": "Careful walking around here. I've heard it's full of ghosts.",
  "GhostMaleA_10122": "Wouldn't need that light if you ate your carrots like you're supposed to.",
  "GhostMaleA_10123": "You deserve an Order of Merlin for what you did.",
  "GhostMaleB_00185": "(grunt)",
  "GhostMaleB_10005": "Well, he does look rather ghastly. They should give him the Astronomy Tower and be done with it.",
  "GhostMaleB_10006": "What does she do all day? Sit in on lessons? Cry about her life? ",
  "GhostMaleB_10007": "I don't know why he thinks the smell will help. Then I never was partial to rotting bird.",
  "GhostMaleB_10008": "Pfft. Nonsense. That woman died centuries ago – it can't be her.",
  "GhostMaleB_10009": "So I told him, 'Whoever heard of a Muggle ghost?' But as it turns out, they were a Squib!",
  "GhostMaleB_10010": "Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration, if you must ask why.",
  "GhostMaleB_10011": "Whatever's wrong with unicorn tail? I always thought it made for a fine wand.",
  "GhostMaleB_10012": "Well there's no need to be like that. I'm only saying, death by Dragon Pox is nothing to boast about.",
  "GhostMaleB_10013": "The school will burn down before you get rid of Peeves. Mark my words.",
  "GhostMaleB_10014": "No, no, the Astronomy Tower. Awful racket.",
  "GhostMaleB_10015": "(sigh)",
  "GhostMaleB_10016": "I had almost forgotten –",
  "GhostMaleB_10017": "The taste of food –",
  "GhostMaleB_10018": "Who would have thought a mortal would be so good at this? You've almost got him.",
  "GhostMaleB_10019": "It won't be long now. You'll find him.",
  "GhostMaleB_10041": "Off they go!",
  "GhostMaleB_10042": "Quite a sight!",
  "GhostMaleB_10044": "A Graphorn? Here?",
  "GhostMaleB_10045": "Ah how majestic.",
  "GhostMaleB_10057": " Ha.",
  "GhostMaleB_10058": "Winner or not, the race was unsanctioned.",
  "GhostMaleB_10080": "As of late, you're always with Professor Fig.",
  "GhostMaleB_10081": "Another great tragedy has fallen unto these halls.",
  "GhostMaleB_10082": "Oh what I'd do to those goblins if I had the chance!",
  "GhostMaleB_10095": "Not sure what you want from Jackdaw, but best be careful. Just look at him. Managed to lose his head after all.",
  "GhostMaleB_10096": "Whoever's there – you'll have a time of it trying to scare a ghost, I assure you.",
  "GhostMaleB_10097": "Who's that?",
  "GhostMaleB_10098": "Oh do be on your way and leave us to enjoy the quiet.",
  "GhostMaleB_10099": "Children in the Restricted Section? At this hour? You wait till I tell the Headmaster.",
  "GhostMaleB_10100": "Ah well. Nobody to scare away tonight.",
  "GhostMaleB_10101": "Hmph. Nothing after all.",
  "GhostMaleB_10102": "A fine night for revelry.",
  "GhostMaleB_10103": "My mortal life was never this entertaining.",
  "GhostMaleB_10104": "I never would have allowed myself to be seen walking about in such attire.",
  "GhostMaleB_10105": "No, not the Dark Arts. You mustn't do that!",
  "GhostMaleB_10107": "What you did for Hogwarts – it'll go down in history. Stuff of legend, that was.",
  "GhostMaleB_10108": "What do you think you're doing?",
  "GhostMaleB_10109": "Do mind where you're going. So inconsiderate.",
  "GhostMaleB_10110": "What are you doing here? You ought to be sleeping.",
  "GhostMaleB_10111": "This is no place for the living. You ought to get back to Hogwarts.",
  "GhostMaleB_10112": "Do you mind? Anyone'd think it was a Streeler passing by.",
  "GhostMaleB_10113": "Glad I wasn't alive in your time.",
  "GladwinMoon_10059": "Although I hear your visit to Hogsmeade was even more eventful than mine.",
  "GladwinMoon_10071": "They each hold a moon that can only be extracted at night. Once removed, the statues simply vanish.",
  "GladwinMoon_10073": "You see, that day in Hogsmeade, I turned a corner and came face to face with a Boggart – or shape-shifter, if you will –",
  "GladwinMoon_10077": "Ugh. Just hearing the name sends chills down my spine.",
  "GladwinMoon_10092": "That is why I need your help in removing the statues.",
  "GladwinMoon_10094": "Curfew? Tosh! I sense you're a bit like me when I was your age. The school was my oyster –",
  "GladwinMoon_10098": "Goodness, you're as fearless as I'd hoped. An excellent start. If we can collect more, it may shed some light on who's behind all this.",
  "GladwinMoon_10138": "Come and see me once you've found the two moons.",
  "GladwinMoon_10153": "– those curious statues have begun appearing about the castle. A fair number have been strewn around Hogsmeade.",
  "GladwinMoon_10161": "Do you see that curious statue over there? Watch what happens when the light changes from day to night.",
  "GladwinMoon_10165": "I knew you were the one to ask for help. Keep at it so we can solve this mystery.",
  "GladwinMoon_10166": "Ever since that fateful day in the village –",
  "GladwinMoon_10167": "Someone, it seems, is trying to torment me.",
  "GladwinMoon_10170": "Remember: use a Disillusionment Charm so no one claps eyes on you.",
  "GladwinMoon_10171": "Well done. You're in.",
  "GladwinMoon_10174": "That wasn't exactly swift and silent now, was it?",
  "GladwinMoon_10175": "Chin up, even the best of us get caught sometimes. Except me, of course.",
  "GladwinMoon_10176": "Don't forget to cast the Disillusionment Charm so you're not spotted.",
  "GladwinMoon_10177": "Nothing to do but get back in there and find those moons.",
  "GladwinMoon_10179": "Now remember, the moons are only retrievable at night. Thus, I encourage you to use disillusionment when necessary.",
  "GladwinMoon_10180": "My mind feels lighter already knowing those statues are gone.",
  "GladwinMoon_10181": "I knew I could count on you. Bring me a few more moons and I'll show you how to improve casting <i>Alohomora</i>.",
  "GladwinMoon_10182": "With that knowledge, you'll be able to break open even stronger locks.",
  "GladwinMoon_10191": "If you bring me more moons, I'll show you how to cast the most powerful form of <i>Alohomora</i> known to wizardkind. At least, known to me.",
  "GladwinMoon_10194": "Dear me – you have been busy. Incredible! Thank you!",
  "GladwinMoon_10211": "Keep looking for those moons. You'll save my sanity and we may get to the bottom of whoever's behind all of this.",
  "GladwinMoon_10212": "Now that you've mastered <i>Alohomora</i>, no lock is unbreakable. But do feel free to keep finding Demiguise statues and removing those moons.",
  "GladwinMoon_10213": "Odd little contraptions, aren't they? It seems the statue vanishes once the moon is removed.",
  "GladwinMoon_10214": "Now, if you wouldn't mind humouring me for a moment, see if you can remove the moon from the statue.",
  "GladwinMoon_10215": "Go on, take the moon.",
  "GladwinMoon_10218": "First, you know how to cast a Disillusionment Charm, correct? You'll want to do that before wandering the tower at night.",
  "GladwinMoon_10221": "Now, you'll find one statue in the Prefects' bathroom and the other in the hospital wing. Good luck. And thank you.",
  "GladwinMoon_10222": "– and I took advantage of it.  Everyone loved me for it. Ahh, those were the days.",
  "GladwinMoon_10223": "I did promise to show you how to improve casting <i>Alohomora</i> once you'd brought me enough moons.",
  "GladwinMoon_10227": "You're ready for the final <i>Alohomora</i> lesson. With this knowledge, no lock shall ever stand in your way.",
  "GladwinMoon_10237": "Oh, thank you. The fewer of these statues I see, the better. You keep your eye out for others and I'll teach you more about <i>Alohomora</i>.",
  "GladwinMoon_10238": "I cannot thank you enough. If you could just find a few more, I'd be so very grateful.",
  "GladwinMoon_10239": "Wonderful. Truly. If you bring me just a few more, I can teach you how to improve casting <i>Alohomora</i>.",
  "GladwinMoon_10250": "We're getting close! But you must bring me more before I can teach you how to improve casting <i>Alohomora</i>.",
  "GladwinMoon_10251": "Ah, yes. Do keep up the good work.",
  "GladwinMoon_10252": "So you have. But bring me a few more and I'll show you how to improve casting <i>Alohomora</i>.",
  "GladwinMoon_10253": "Simply cast <i>Alohomora</i> on the lock.",
  "GladwinMoon_10255": "Perhaps you could start simply by removing them so I can go about my evening duties.",
  "GladwinMoon_10259": "However, we don't yet know who's behind these statues. Still plenty of the foul things lying in wait to torture me. ",
  "GladwinMoon_10260": "Might I trouble you for a moment of your time?",
  "GladwinMoon_10261": "Pardon, me, but I wonder if I might speak with you.",
  "GladwinMoon_10277": "Pleasure. You might want to turn back Miss Onai. Turn and (hiccough) run.",
  "GladwinMoon_10282": "Pleasure.  You might want to turn back Mr Sallow. Turn and (hiccough) run.",
  "GladwinMoon_10283": "It looked right at me. Eyes big as saucers.",
  "GladwinMoon_10287": "Which, incidentally, can only be done at night.",
  "GladwinMoon_10288": "In fact, my recent visit to Hogsmeade is the reason I was hoping to bump into you. I could use your help with something.",
  "GladwinMoon_10304": "I am determined, with your help, to discover the identity of my tormentor.",
  "GladwinMoon_10329": "A couple of reasons, frankly. First, your derring-do against those trolls in Hogsmeade has gained you a reputation for fearlessness.",
  "GladwinMoon_10330": "I have my suspicion as to the scoundrel – or scoundrels – responsible. It is my hope that they will slip up and reveal themselves as the statues disappear.",
  "GladwinMoon_10334": "First, please allow me to apologise if I seemed a bit – unsteady – when we last met I'm afraid I'd had a rather disconcerting encounter.",
  "GladwinMoon_10335": "This is a restricted area of the castle, after all.",
  "GladwinMoon_10336": "Very well. If you must.",
  "GladwinMoon_10337": "(shivers) Yes. Terrifying creature that can see the future. Wholly unnerving. I encountered one when I was a lad in Korea. Terrible experience.",
  "GladwinMoon_10338": "Those statues are Demiguises. The moons, I assume, are an uninspired play on my name.",
  "GladwinMoon_10339": "Second, as macabre and hideous as a Demiguise is, most would find my fear of them unwarranted.",
  "GladwinMoon_10340": "Of course, I first suspected Peeves. He drove the previous caretaker, Rancorous Carpe, to an early retirement with his intolerable buffoonery.",
  "GladwinMoon_10341": "I knew I could count on you.",
  "GladwinMoon_10342": "Oh, you needn't worry. You'll be perfectly fine if you simply mind you're not seen.",
  "GladwinMoon_10343": "Oh, rest assured: there's very little risk and there is, in fact, a reward. I will teach you a particularly useful spell.",
  "GladwinMoon_10344": "You, my friend, are a gentleperson and a scholar. And I have something to offer in exchange for your assistance.",
  "GladwinMoon_10345": "Understood. But I hope you will find the time. In case it matters, I do have something to offer in exchange for your assistance.",
  "GladwinMoon_10347": "Next, you'll notice that the door is locked. How ever will you get in?  <i>Alohomora</i>, that's how.",
  "GladwinMoon_10348": "As I mentioned, I have an intense aversion to Demiguises. Perhaps one day I'll tell you more about it.",
  "GladwinMoon_10349": "Whoever planted the statues everywhere knows about my fear and is seeking to make it my ruin.",
  "GladwinMoon_10350": "No, but I suspect the motive is jealousy. People have always been jealous of my skills, popularity and dashing good looks.",
  "GladwinMoon_10351": "No one is above suspicion.",
  "GladwinMoon_10352": "I was hoping to see you again, my young friend. Gladwin Moon, Hogwarts caretaker, at your service.",
  "GladwinMoon_10353": "Of course not! And from what I understand, the village was lucky you were there.",
  "GladwinMoon_10355": "I'm at my wit's end, young friend. I simply cannot bring myself to go near them.",
  "GladwinMoon_10356": "– which takes the form of whatever scares you most. This one took the form of a Demiguise.",
  "GladwinMoon_10357": "It looked right at me, eyes big as saucers!",
  "GladwinMoon_10358": "Demi –(hiccough)guise. Ugly and hairy and terrifying.",
  "GladwinMoon_10360": "I shall be at the castle where it's safe. Good luck to both of you.",
  "GladwinMoon_10361": "Demi –(hiccough)guise. Ugly and hairy and terrifying.",
  "GladwinMoon_10363": "I shall be at the castle where it's safe. Good luck to both of you.",
  "GladwinMoon_10365": "Why don't you hold onto that one for now and I'll explain more as we walk.",
  "GladwinMoon_10366": "Some jackanapes used a Boggart to learn my greatest fear and use it against me.",
  "GladwinMoon_10367": "You, however, have seen how they affect me.",
  "GladwinMoon_10368": "But that does not explain the Boggart in Hogsmeade, does it? No.",
  "GladwinMoon_10369": "In fact, I know of two statues right here in the Faculty Tower.",
  "GladwinMoon_10370": "I don't know precisely, but I've spotted dozens. Seems they're everywhere I look.",
  "GladwinMoon_10371": "I did. Once you've brought me enough moons, I'll show you even more powerful forms of <i>Alohomora</i>.",
  "GladwinMoon_10372": "Not every lock is as easy to pick as the Faculty Tower's.",
  "GladwinMoon_10373": "You have your work cut out for you, if we're to ever unravel their meaning.",
  "GladwinMoon_10374": "I appreciate that.",
  "GladwinMoon_10375": "Have you found any more of those ghastly Demiguise statues?",
  "GladwinMoon_10376": "You have done all I asked. I only wish I knew who put those statues everywhere in the first place. Alas!",
  "GladwinMoon_10377": "I might have known. 'Pigtails' Piers.",
  "GladwinMoon_10378": "Of course he does. He had such flowing locks. We used to laugh about them. I laughed the hardest of all.",
  "GladwinMoon_10379": "He could always take a joke, Piers. He's playing with me. Ha, hasn't changed a bit. Wonder if he still has the flowing locks, er, 'pigtails'.",
  "GladwinMoon_10380": "Clever, clever man. I'd no idea he was so devious. I must go and congratulate him.",
  "GladwinMoon_10381": "Whatever statues remain seem less terrifying now that I know they were put out by old 'Pigtails'.",
  "GladwinMoon_10382": "Continue collecting them if you like. As for me, I'm going to pay a visit to my old friend.",
  "GladwinMoon_10384": "I hope you've been staying vigilant with those Demiguise statues. Someone must.",
  "GladwinMoon_10386": "And if I ever find out who the bully is behind this cruel trick, I shall let you know.",
  "GladwinMoon_10387": "I hope you will come and see me about a pressing and highly confidential matter at your earliest convenience. I believe that we may be able to help each other.",
  "GladwinMoon_10388": "Greetings! Any luck removing some more of those Demiguise statues?",
  "GladwinMoon_10389": "How unfortunate. I was hoping you'd found them – and removed those blasted moons.",
  "GladwinMoon_10390": "All of my usual haunts. Which, incidentally, have now become quite haunting.",
  "GladwinMoon_10391": "Here in the castle, in Hogsmeade and, believe it or not, in some of the surrounding hamlets.",
  "GladwinMoon_10392": "You are to be commended for your bravery and valour. Especially since they can only be collected at night.",
  "GladwinMoon_10393": "My tormentor is nothing if not thorough. Kept me from all of my usual engagements for an eternity now.",
  "GladwinMoon_10394": "Thank you, once again, for your assistance and tenacity.",
  "GladwinMoon_10395": "If you do find more, please feel free to remove them. You will be doing your caretaker a huge service.",
  "GladwinMoon_10396": "Greetings! Any luck removing some more of those Demiguise statues?",
  "GladwinMoon_10397": "How unfortunate. I was hoping you would've – and removed those blasted moons.",
  "GladwinMoon_10398": "I commend you for your courage and valour. Especially since they can only be collected at night.",
  "GladwinMoon_10399": "All of my usual haunts. Which, as you know, have now become quite haunting.",
  "GladwinMoon_10400": "Here in the castle, in Hogsmeade, and, believe it or not, in some of the surrounding hamlets.",
  "GladwinMoon_10401": "My tormentor is nothing if not thorough. I haven't left the castle in ages – and I'm constantly on edge.",
  "GladwinMoon_10402": "Thank you for your persistence and cleverness! I confronted Piers about it and he confessed straightaway, the old rascal. We've agreed to let bygones be bygones. Don't forget to say hello the next time you're in the Three Broomsticks. Thrilled to be back there again!",
  "GladwinMoon_10414": "Oh! Someone's been having a wild old time.",
  "GladwinMoon_10419": "I shall honour Professor Fig's sacrifice by looking after this school to the highest degree.",
  "GladwinMoon_10426": "Pity I couldn't have been there to stop that troll attack in Hogsmeade.",
  "GladwinMoon_10433": "Oh, Ranrok's made an awful mess of things. Done no favours for goblinkind, that one.",
  "GladwinMoon_10440": "I succeed in my craft as caretaker by keeping such dire magic out of school grounds. If you don't mind. And can stop that.",
  "GladwinMoon_10447": "Looking for something to aid your homework, no doubt. (chuckling)",
  "GladwinMoon_10461": "Careful – things'll soon go to pot if I'm put out of commission.",
  "GladwinMoon_10468": "We are fortunate to have a student brave enough to eradicate the Demiguise figurine menace.",
  "GladwinMoon_10475": "How could you not see me?",
  "GladwinMoon_10482": "Ah, the frustrations of youth. Don't you worry, I shall look the other way.",

  "GraceWaldegrave_10017": "Splendid! Precisely the response I'd hoped for.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10018": "Years ago, my grandfather – who fancied himself quite the astronomer – set sail from Hogsmeade Station for what was meant to be a quick star-gazing cruise with my grandmother.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10019": "We can't be sure. We only know that neither they nor their boat made it back to shore. They were presumed drowned.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10022": "I understand. But, I'd be forever grateful. Of course, you may discover much more than the astrolabe. Anything else you found would be all yours.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10024": "I've cross-referenced the vessel's last alleged location against the lake's topography, depth charts, and tide schedule.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10026": "That's like asking why the sky is blue or grass is green. The Pinch-Smedley name is synonymous with intellectual curiosity.",

  "GraceWaldegrave_10035": "I do hope you find the astrolabe. It would mean so much to our family.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10036": "Oh, how incredible. Did you find the astrolabe?",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10037": "It will. I can't wait to see his face.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10038": "I see. That's fair, I suppose. A reward, so to speak, for finding the buried treasure.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10039": "Thank you for recovering it.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10041": "You'd do well to keep an eye out for more spots to dive. A diver of your calibre is certain to find all sorts of things down there.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10042": "Thank you again, and I do hope you keep diving. You certainly have a knack for finding treasure.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10044": "Oh, thank goodness. Yes. My name is Grace Pinch-Smedley – of the Bath Pinch-Smedleys – ? ",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10052": "A treasured family astrolabe vanished with them that night. If you could dive down and retrieve it, I may be able to bring my father some peace.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10054": "Father was so distraught that he forbade our family from setting foot on or in the Black Lake ever again.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10056": "It's an astonishing, ancient navigational tool. Essentially a handheld model of the universe.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10057": "I was hoping someone would come along soon. I was about to defy my father's wishes and would never have forgiven myself.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10058": "What? But you can't. It doesn't belong to you.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10059": "I can't believe this. Father's stupid oath just cost us a priceless family artefact.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10060": "They never returned.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10061": "My best guess is that it's just over there, about a furlong from the dock. It would be wonderful to have my grandfather's astrolabe back.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10062": "Thank you so much for doing this for me – and for my family.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10063": "I hope your new astrolabe brings you nothing but sorrow. If you can even work out how to use it!",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10064": "I knew I should have done the dive myself. Father's wishes be damned.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10066": "It's mainly used for studying the stars – astronomical pursuits – but it has nearly a thousand uses. Fascinating device.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10070": "Next, and last, most likely. I'm Grace. Pinch-Smedley, of the Bath Pinch-Smedleys.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10071": "Shall we begin?",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10072": "Well, let's see what you're made of.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10073": "Hmph. Well, find me when you're ready to lose.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10074": "I knew you'd come around.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10075": "Let's see how you fare this time.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10076": "Ready?",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10077": "Nice to see you! Thank you again for your help at the lake.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10078": "Well done! Diving, Summoner's Court – seems there's nothing you can't do.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10079": "I did play rather well, didn't I?",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10080": "You really are insufferable.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10081": "Only one student has ever beaten me. She's very good, but if you play the way you did against me you might stand a chance.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10082": "Seems you couldn't get the upper hand that time. How about another round?",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10083": "Then take your mark.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10084": "Another time, then. I shall be here.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10085": "That wasn't what I wanted to see.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10086": "Tsk. Tsk.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10087": "Impressive.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10088": "You – didn't see that.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10089": "I do wish you would take your turn.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10090": "Well, it appears I've been bested.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10091": "Seems I got the better of you.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10092": "A draw? We can't leave it like that.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10093": "<i>Accio!</i>",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10094": "You certainly know what you're doing when it comes to Summoner's Court. Can't believe you beat Ronen!",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10095": "What a remarkable shot!",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10096": "You've a nerve, speaking to me after what you did. I hope you're taking good care of my priceless family astrolabe.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10097": "Fine. Would be nice to take you down a peg. I assume you're ready.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10098": "I've become quite good at Summoner's Court and I'm waiting for my next opponent. I suppose that's you.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10099": "Hmph. Wasn't enough you kept my family astrolabe, was it? You had to beat me at Summoner's Court as well.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10100": "Ha! Seems you couldn't beat me. Serves you right for keeping my family heirloom. Care to go again?",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10101": "Thank you. But I'm not sure I'm ready to forgive just yet.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10102": "You may have beaten me. But your next opponent is sure to take you down a peg – which will be a joy to see.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10103": "We are known for our contributions to science and art. I'm surprised you haven't heard of us, frankly.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10104": "That's the way to do it.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10105": "Well played.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10106": "How rude. I played my very best.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10107": "Would you like to go again? Perhaps try to learn from your mistakes?",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10108": "Ah, yes. Summoners Court. I thought I recognised you.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10109": "I was hoping you could dive down and retrieve a treasured family astrolabe lost during a doomed stargazing cruise.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10110": "I trust you didn't find the dive too terribly difficult?",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10111": "The Pinch-Smedleys will always look upon you as a trusted ally and friend.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10112": "The Pinch-Smedleys will always look upon you as a blackguard and an enemy.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10113": "Sadly, I'd imagine it's rusted beyond repair now. Still, we'd love to have it returned to us. It would be like getting a bit of my grandparents back.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10114": "That's some nice flying. Impressive broom as well.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10115": "I didn't know we were allowed to have Graphorns.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10116": "Hippogriffs have got to smell like chickens. I just know it.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10117": "Are you walking in your sleep or did you just forget to get dressed?",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10118": "Professor Fig – killed right here in the castle.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10119": "Good thing I wasn't in Hogsmeade when the trolls attacked.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10120": "Ranrok and his Loyalists got exactly what they deserved.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10121": "There you are – Summoner's Court champion.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10122": " The Dark Arts. What are you doing?",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10123": "You do know things are locked for a reason.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10125": "Don't do that. You could hurt someone.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10126": "Pardon me.",
  "GraceWaldegrave_10127": "Proud of yourself?",
  "GreyLady_10014": "He should have just let me go.",
  "GreyLady_10016": "Foolish. Foolish. Foolish.",
  "GreyLady_10017": "I'm so sorry, mother. I only ever wanted to – (weeps)",
  "GreyLady_10018": "I never even said farewell.",
  "GreyLady_10019": "Let him howl. I'll never forgive him.",
  "GreyLady_10020": "(intense sobbing)",
  "GreyLady_10021": "I must leave.",
  "GreyLady_10022": "Excuse me. I am – not myself.",
  "GreyLady_10023": "Please, would you be so kind as to leave me be?",
  "GreyLady_10024": "(gentle sobbing)",
  "GreyLady_10025": "(escalating sobs)",
  "GreyLady_10029": "Must I now be trapped here with him?",
  "GreyLady_10030": "(light sobbing)",
  "GreyLady_10031": "(sniffles)",
  "GreyLady_10032": "If you could have remained, mother.",
  "GreyLady_10033": "If only you could know how sorry I am.",
  "GreyLady_10034": "No one can know.",
  "GreyLady_10035": "(intense sobbing)",
  "GreyLady_10036": "(sniffles)",
  "GreyLady_10038": "So many trinkets around here. It was bound to happen.",
  "GreyLady_10039": "This new style of clothing is quite strange.",
  "GreyLady_10040": "Certainly a dark turn for one so young.",
  "GreyLady_10042": "So Hogwarts lives on, free of the goblin menace.",
  "GreyLady_10043": "That sort of thing only leads to trouble.",
  "GreyLady_10044": "Careful where you are stepping, please.",
  "GreyLady_10045": "I can't say I blame anyone seeking solace in the night.",
  "GreyLady_10046": "Don't be surprised if you illuminate something troubling.",
  "GringottsGoblinGuard_10003": "Vault number?",
  "GringottsGoblinGuard_10004": "On your way.",
  "Grol_10100": "Foolish children. Do you know what happens to wizards who wander here? Now, follow me before –",
  "Grol_10103": "Leave them be, Elek. We do not harm the young; It is not our way.",
  "Grol_10123": "Now all that remains is to break the charm –",
  "Grol_10141": "I, on the other hand, must go speak with the herd. Find me after you have done this.",
  "Grol_10143": "From what I can see, they have slaughtered no one. They will leave here unharmed.",
  "Grol_10152": "Could it be –?",
  "Grol_10153": "In the south there is a cave within which lies what the poachers seek – a moonstone. Retrieve it and place it in the henge in the forest.",
  "Grol_10158": "You should make haste there. The Snidgets that have been kept there for so many years may no longer be safe.",
  "Grol_10159": "There. There they are.",
  "Grol_10160": "No harm will come to them. The centaurs will see to that. You have my word.",
  "Grol_10164": "It is you who deserves the merit, child. You did what the poachers would never have. Remember that.",
  "Grol_10169": "I believe the symbol created by the Mooncalves' dance marks the place the Snidgets are hidden. And, serendipitously, I believe that I know the very place.",
  "Grol_10172": "We cannot afford to lose the Snidgets once again.",
  "Grol_10176": "I saw the arrival of a stranger, the threat of an enemy, and the return of an old friend.",
  "Grol_10177": "I shall say that fortune favours us today. That you would show me a symbol whose provenance I recognise is not coincidence, but fate.",
  "Grol_10178": "I believe now that you are the strangers, the poachers are the enemy, and the old friends are the Snidgets.",
  "Grol_10183": "Many, many moons ago, I divined a series of events. Their meaning long evaded me – until you brought news of the Snidgets and their poacher pursuers.",
  "Grol_10185": "I have seen that symbol only once: on a rock face in the cliffs of the Forest.",
  "Grol_10189": "I also saw two places tied to these events. The cave with the moonstone –and the henge. The latter was bathed in moonlight.",
  "Grol_10190": "I do not know. It is what I have read in the stars. Fortunes play out as they are intended. I am merely a messenger.",
  "Grol_10206": "They are the ones I saw, Elek.",
  "Grol_10207": "And you say they made it after you placed the moonstone.",
  "Grol_10208": "The breadth of one's knowledge can be as wide as the seas, and yet only run so deep.",
  "Grol_10209": "You both fought bravely today. Allow us to carry the mantle from here.",
  "Grol_10210": "I did not know my young friend. But I shall say that I was not surprised. It was in much the same manner that I expected our first meeting.",
  "Grol_10211": "Of course. I find it is often the best place to start, is it not?",
  "Grol_10213": "I did question the wisdom of sending you on a path at a time when that path was unknown at best, deadly at worst.",
  "Grol_10214": "But the acumen of centaurs is neither personal nor partial. The skies tell us what is to come – and often we do not know what we have seen until it has come to pass.",
  "Grol_10215": "She did. And I am glad to see that you are both safely returned.",
  "Grol_10218": "Ready your wands! The fight has only just begun!",
  "Grol_10219": "Are the two of you unharmed? I had hoped to return before it was too late.",
  "Grol_10220": "Not at all. Then again, it is not I who awaits your arrival. Do you have the moonstone with you?",
  "Grol_10221": "Good. It is as important to what happens next as both of you are.",
  "Grol_10222": "And as for how to go about that, the two of you may know better than anyone.",
  "Grol_10223": "A safeguard I suspect. There is only one way to find out.",
  "Grol_10224": "I suspect we all know what lies beyond that passage. And now, I am afraid I must leave you – at least for a time.",
  "Grol_10225": "If the Snidgets are here, the herd will want to see the truth of it for themselves. Elek, especially.",
  "Grol_10226": "Go on without me. I will rejoin as soon as I am able.",
  "Grol_10227": "I shall see you there.",
  "Grol_10228": "Greetings.",
  "Guardian1_10313": "The Portkey is well hidden?",
  "Guardian1_10316": "I am indeed. I must confess that I am surprised to see someone so young standing before me.",
  "Guardian1_10317": "You've paid attention. And, might I presume, you share our – ability?",
  "Guardian1_10320": "Hmm. That is unfortunate.",
  "Guardian1_10324": "They were an important part of the journey, but they were not trials themselves. The fact that you have come this far, however, bodes well.",
  "Guardian1_10326": "We have waited this long, Professor Fig. Surely a few more –",
  "Guardian1_10327": "This is grave news indeed. Young friend, do you trust Professor Fig?",
  "Guardian1_10328": "Then, in light of your considerable skill and all you have already accomplished, we shall begin. You will find the location of the first trial marked on the map below you.",
  "Guardian1_10330": "Downstairs, near the entry, a reservoir of ancient magic – like those you've seen before – has been unlocked.",
  "Guardian1_10333": "As Professor Fig cannot join you, he and I will, in time, see you back at the Map Chamber.",
  "Guardian1_10337": "May be impossible to follow? It will only be impossible for one who cannot see traces of ancient magic – as I can.",
  "Guardian1_10338": "Yes, and if we are correct, Charles, the witch or wizard who completes the trials will have proven themselves worthy of that knowledge and the responsibility that accompanies it.",
  "Guardian1_10342": "Has someone finally found our Map Chamber?",
  "Guardian1_10343": "We have much to discuss.",
  "Guardian1_10344": "But first – a map found in a certain book led you here. Place the book on the pedestal.",
  "Guardian1_10345": "I'm afraid we must pause our conversation until you return with the book.",
  "Guardian1_10346": "Your ability to transfigure the world around you is remarkable.",
  "Guardian1_10347": "What is it?",
  "Guardian1_10349": "You do so much for your father already, you –",
  "Guardian1_10350": "It is tempting, I know, to use this magic that you’re mastering to transfigure more than the physical world.",
  "Guardian1_10351": "But, human emotion is a potent force unto itself.",
  "Guardian1_10352": "It is not your pain to take.",
  "Guardian1_10353": "– every year a student sees something sillier than I could ever imagine in their tea leaves.",
  "Guardian1_10354": "Miss Morganach. Welcome back to Hogwarts, Professor.",
  "Guardian1_10355": "Sit, sit, Isidora. Tell us about your travels.",
  "Guardian1_10356": "That would be delightful. We shall let the others know.",
  "Guardian1_10357": "With the proper training.",
  "Guardian1_10358": "Miss Isidora Morganach. Welcome.",
  "Guardian1_10361": "As it happens, I was also admitted to Hogwarts as a fifth-year. I've never heard of another like us.",
  "Guardian1_10362": "It was not your imagination.",
  "Guardian1_10363": "The whispers – or traces – that appear when a particular form of ancient magic is wielded.",
  "Guardian1_10364": "Before I can train you to wield such magic, you must first master all that Hogwarts has to offer.",
  "Guardian1_10365": "How do you do, Professor Fig?",
  "Guardian1_10369": "You will need patience. The trials have much to teach you. It will take time.",
  "Guardian1_10373": "What have you done?",
  "Guardian1_10374": "Students, Isidora?",
  "Guardian1_10375": "Isidora, set down your wand.",
  "Guardian1_10376": "I did not teach you this.",
  "Guardian1_10377": "<i>Expelliarmus!</i>",
  "Guardian1_10378": "Isidora, we are all most intrigued to hear –",
  "Guardian1_10379": "Isidora –",
  "Guardian1_10380": "What have you done?",
  "Guardian1_10381": "This is uncharted magic, Isidora.",
  "Guardian1_10382": "Even the most well-meaning and competent witch cannot possibly know the consequences of irrevocably manipulating it.",
  "Guardian1_10383": "You can only see what has been sealed in the jar – and we do not know what power that may hold. But the traces of that magic are different from what I've seen before.",
  "Guardian1_10384": "It is agonising to see those we love suffer.",
  "Guardian1_10393": "Of course.",
  "Guardian1_10394": "Professor Fitzgerald needs some time to clear the way forward. Until then, you should continue to hone your magic.",
  "Guardian1_10395": "If you learn more about Ranrok and Victor Rookwood's activities in the meantime, please let us know.",
  "Guardian1_10397": "Before you go –",
  "Guardian1_10399": "We can access expressions of magic that few others can.",
  "Guardian1_10403": "Can it be?",
  "Guardian1_10404": "This is grave news indeed. We had hoped for more time to discuss the best path forward.",
  "Guardian1_10405": "The next trial will involve an exceptional level of magical skill – and a nuanced ability to interact with beasts.",
  "Guardian1_10406": "Find a face of stone and tendrils.",
  "Guardian1_10407": "I should advise you that you must engage with any beast that is part of the trial on your own.",
  "Guardian1_10408": "It is. You see, we could not destroy the strands of emotion Isidora had stolen from so many. So we did all that we could to keep them safe.",
  "Guardian1_10423": "It is a joy to have such a student.",
  "Guardian1_10424": "Our relationship with magic is ever-evolving. You would do well to build upon what you know.",
  "Guardian1_10425": "We will meet again soon.",
  "Guardian1_10426": "That you have come this far tells me that you possess extraordinary magical ability –",
  "Guardian1_10427": "The location of each of four trials will, in time, appear on the map. Trials that will test you – and give you access to invaluable knowledge.",
  "Guardian1_10428": "Trials that you must complete on your own.",
  "Guardian1_10429": "Charles is another of the Keepers – a designation we gave ourselves centuries ago –",
  "Guardian1_10430": "– in light of the knowledge that we have been bound to keep hidden. Until, perhaps, now.",
  "Guardian1_10431": "Whilst Professor Fig may assist you in locating the trials, they may be completed only by one with our ability.",
  "Guardian1_10432": "Opportunities will arise that allow you to sharpen this rare talent. Do not squander them.",
  "Guardian1_10433": "I am glad to see that I was correct in presuming that we would meet again – soon after our last encounter.",
  "Guardian1_10434": "Though I surmise, based on the commotion I heard, that you did not have an easy time getting to me.",
  "Guardian1_10435": "That goblins were aware of my vault is disquieting enough.",
  "Guardian1_10436": "I did. Professor Bakar is a Keeper you have yet to encounter.",
  "Guardian1_10437": "Command it to access a doorway. I'm afraid I cannot say more.",
  "Guardian1_10438": "Before you proceed, I would like to speak with Charles regarding the urgent situation involving the goblins.",
  "Guardian1_10439": "The student has seen traces of a powerful Dark Magic being wielded by goblinkind.",
  "Guardian1_10440": "They and their mentor, Professor Fig, not only encountered goblins lurking outside of San Bakar's tower –",
  "Guardian1_10441": "– they also encountered a powerful goblin in my vault at Gringotts.",
  "Guardian1_10442": "Based upon the memories they have seen, I believe our young friend is well aware of the grave circumstances in which we find ourselves.",
  "Guardian1_10443": "I am convinced that they must finish the trials and use the knowledge we have so carefully curated to protect the wizarding world.",
  "Guardian1_10446": "Another Ollivander? I am not surprised. As I am sure he will tell you, this wand may be used for only one purpose.",
  "Guardian1_10450": "Good. We shall speak again once the book is in place.",
  "Guardian1_10451": "I assure you that all will be clear once the book has been placed on the pedestal.",
  "Guardian1_10452": "I am.",
  "Guardian1_10454": "I cannot say more at present – except to say that your presence here does not entirely surprise me.",
  "Guardian1_10459": "And you, my young friend, see now why you needed to return with the book.",
  "Guardian1_10460": "– the potential and power of which will unlock, should you prove yourself worthy.",
  "Guardian1_10461": "Remember what you see.",
  "Guardian1_10462": "Welcome to San Bakar's tower.",
  "Guardian1_10463": "Do you recall the Pensieve memory you viewed in my vault in Gringotts?",
  "Guardian1_10464": "My friend Charles and I spoke of the Portkey – and of trials we'd created for one who could see traces of ancient magic.",
  "Guardian1_10465": "Precisely.",
  "Guardian1_10467": "As you have likely realised by now, our ability gives us a unique relationship with all forms of magic.",
  "Guardian1_10468": "Professor Rookwood told me about what happened at Rookwood Castle.",
  "Guardian1_10469": "We trust your judgement, Professor Fitzgerald. You should know better than anyone how to manage the inconvenience of, well –",
  "Guardian1_10471": "You're back.",
  "Guardian1_10472": "We need to speak with you.",
  "Guardian1_10473": "We have much to discuss.",
  "Guardian1_10478": "Allow me to introduce former Hogwarts headmistress, Niamh Fitzgerald.",
  "Guardian1_10479": "Best of luck.",
  "Guardian1_10481": "Professor Bakar will meet you in his Pensieve room.",
  "Guardian1_10484": "We also realised that until they could be destroyed, the magic used to create them was a danger to wizardkind.",
  "Guardian1_10485": "Hence, we became Keepers. Keepers of an unfathomable secret. We knew that – some day – one with the ability to see traces of ancient magic might be seduced by its power.",
  "Guardian1_10486": "We built the trials to lead that person to us. To allow them to prove themselves worthy of the knowledge we'd kept hidden and the responsibility that accompanies it.",
  "Guardian1_10491": "You have, and you will. But the repository is protected by powerful ancient magic. To enter, you must craft a special wand from the four artefacts you found above our Pensieves.",
  "Guardian1_10492": "If he is, as you suspect, capable of using the power of the other repository, I fear he will be able to breach our defences.",
  "Guardian1_10493": "Return with the wand and we will open the way forward.",
  "Guardian1_10494": "Take them to Mr Ollivander. He will help you to craft a wand that can be used to enter the repository.",
  "Guardian1_10495": "You have the wand. You will know when to wield it. We leave our legacy in your hands.",
  "Guardian1_10497": "You have completed all of our trials. And you have done so under circumstances even I did not foresee.",
  "Guardian1_10498": "The trials were designed to ensure that the power and knowledge we have kept secret for so long does not fall into the wrong hands.",
  "Guardian1_10499": "They will test your abilities – both innate and learned.",
  "Guardian1_10500": "But if they have also made a connection to this tower, then the threat may be greater than I thought. All the more reason for us to move forward.",
  "Guardian1_10501": "But of equal importance: everything you witness as you complete the trials will inform what you choose to do with all that we share.",
  "Guardian1_10502": "San. I'm glad you're here.",
  "Guardian1_10503": "I know.",
  "Guardian1_10504": "What is it?",
  "Guardian1_10505": "Everything is much worse than I feared. Niamh was right. Isidora hasn't stopped.",
  "Guardian1_10506": "I have just learned that she has been wielding that magic on students.",
  "Guardian1_10510": "(struggles)",
  "Guardian1_10511": "You understand, now, why all of this was necessary – the Portkey, the vault, the locket, the book, the trials.",
  "Guardian1_10512": "To ensure that one with the ability you and I share would make the same choice that San, Niamh, Charles, and I did.",
  "Guardian1_10513": "What lies in the repository must never be released. Resist the temptation to destroy or control it.",
  "Guardian1_10514": "The magic that you have so carefully honed must now be used only to protect the secret we keep.",
  "Guardian2_10208": "We've done all that we can.",
  "Guardian2_10209": "Perhaps too well. I wonder if the path we've created –",
  "Guardian2_10215": "All is in place.",
  "Guardian2_10216": "Your ability to see what others cannot will not be enough, Percival.",
  "Guardian2_10217": "We are entrusting the one who embarks on this path with powerful secrets – with knowledge others will do anything to obtain.",
  "Guardian2_10221": "I was so pleased to hear that you accepted the position of Defence Against the Dark Arts professor.",
  "Guardian2_10222": "Miss Morganach, when we spoke yesterday after class, you asked about the beautiful swirls you saw years ago, when we visited your hamlet.",
  "Guardian2_10223": "I must say I’m curious to hear of Isidora’s travels.",
  "Guardian2_10231": "Despite the obstacles that clearly await you, you must get to Rookwood Castle immediately.",
  "Guardian2_10264": "I heard something. I was hoping that was you.",
  "Guardian2_10267": "It can be.",
  "Guardian2_10273": "I've heard an unusual amount of activity – goblins and wizards, I surmise – when visiting my portrait at my castle.",
  "Guardian2_10274": "I did not. In fact, I did not make myself known. I only recently returned there and did not recognise – nor trust – anyone that I heard.",
  "Guardian2_10275": "I stayed out of sight so as not to tempt my portrait's destruction.",
  "Guardian2_10277": "No! Things are more dire than I could have imagined.",
  "Guardian2_10278": "The power you stand to wield must first be fully understood. The trials will ensure that.",
  "Guardian2_10282": "I shall reveal the path. Professor Fig must leave you now.",
  "Guardian2_10284": "Professor Charles Rookwood at your service. Has someone completed the first trial?",
  "Guardian2_10289": "Ah. Yes. You will find a similar artefact in each trial. You must take care to keep them safe. You will need them to complete the journey we have set forth for you.",
  "Guardian2_10294": "Once you have them all, we will tell you what to do with them.",
  "Guardian2_10295": "The goblins?",
  "Guardian2_10296": "I'm afraid it would be wise to halt the trials until we know more.",
  "Guardian2_10299": "My descendant – a Dark wizard? I'm afraid we've no time to waste.",
  "Guardian2_10306": "What have we here?",
  "Guardian2_10307": "Before you go –",
  "Guardian2_10308": "Have you encountered swirling traces of magic in the world – aside from those along our path?",
  "Guardian2_10309": "Evidence of the Keepers' efforts to manipulate the power of ancient magic during our time.",
  "Guardian2_10310": "If I am correct – and I usually am – you should be able to use them to inform and enhance your own magic.",
  "Guardian2_10313": "It is good to see you again.",
  "Guardian2_10314": "In light of the dire circumstances in which we find ourselves, it is most fortunate that someone so competent is following this path.",
  "Guardian2_10315": "Good. Are you ready to move on?",
  "Guardian2_10316": "In that case, introductions are in order.",
  "Guardian2_10321": "You will understand more about her actions as you complete the trials.",
  "Guardian2_10323": "It was – pain.",
  "Guardian2_10327": "And in one piece, no less.",
  "Guardian2_10328": "So, you found the Portkey to access Professor Rackham's vault and you deciphered the map within the locket you found floating above that Pensieve?",
  "Guardian2_10329": "I imagine you saw me in the first Pensieve you accessed. In Gringotts.",
  "Guardian2_10330": "Indeed.",
  "Guardian2_10331": "Not only is it the location of the next trial, it is home to a source of power that would be devastating in the wrong hands.",
  "Guardian2_10332": "I do wish we had the luxury of time; however, I do not doubt your abilities. Find my portrait there as soon as you can.",
  "Guardian2_10333": "This makes no sense. How did – ? We shall discuss this later. Right now, you must complete the next trial.",
  "Guardian2_10334": "Power without knowledge is dangerous indeed. In the wrong hands – ",
  "Guardian2_10335": "We will simply have to outwit Ranrok – and my unfortunate namesake.",
  "Guardian2_10337": "Ranrok is searching for something? I feared as much.",
  "Guardian2_10338": "My former residence, yes. That castle is also the location of your next trial.",
  "Guardian2_10339": "Even the most well-meaning and competent amongst us cannot possibly know the consequences of manipulating what should be beyond our reach.",
  "Guardian2_10340": "Dear me, don't tell me this is how you all dress now?",
  "Guardian2_10341": "There's no need for magic like that here.",
  "Guardian2_10342": "Mind you don't scar my canvas.",
  "Guardian2_10354": "If, as you told Percival, a goblin in his vault was wielding a powerful magic, then they have somehow learned – it cannot be.",
  "Guardian3_10064": "It's good to see you.",
  "Guardian3_10065": "Approach the pedestal in the antechamber and read the book that appears.",
  "Guardian3_10141": "We were glad to help.",
  "Guardian3_10142": "Percival – Professor Rackham – can see them too. But we've never known of another who could.",
  "Guardian3_10143": "A magic this powerful can do great harm in the wrong hands. It must be wielded by a select few.",
  "Guardian3_10144": "As such, we ask that you not speak to anyone about what we have discussed here today.",
  "Guardian3_10145": "Isidora, what you did for your father was remarkable –",
  "Guardian3_10146": "You haven’t stopped.",
  "Guardian3_10147": "You spoke to a goblin about this?",
  "Guardian3_10148": "We don’t know what effect any of this may have – the emotions, the Dark traces –",
  "Guardian3_10149": "I don’t follow, Isidora.",
  "Guardian3_10150": "Power like this is not to be toyed with. In the wrong hands –",
  "Guardian3_10151": "What are you doing?",
  "Guardian3_10152": "Oh, Isidora. This must stop. All of it.",
  "Guardian3_10154": "Have a look at the map.",
  "Guardian3_10155": "As you know, I was Headmistress in my time. My portrait hangs in the Headmaster's office.",
  "Guardian3_10157": "Good. I shall meet you in my portrait there. Until then.",
  "Guardian3_10192": "Your suspicions are correct. We shall speak when you are finished.",
  "Guardian3_10193": "A story. I cannot say more. You may recognise some elements of it, as I was inspired by a tale with which many wizarding children are familiar.",
  "Guardian3_10197": "Most troubling.",
  "Guardian3_10203": "In fact, I witnessed Professor Black learn of your arrival – and I'll confess that I wondered about you.",
  "Guardian3_10205": "It is. I had hoped that when the time came the occupant of that office would be of help to us.",
  "Guardian3_10206": "They are. I fear we have no time to lose.",
  "Guardian3_10207": "Fortunately the next trial is fairly nearby.",
  "Guardian3_10211": "Unfortunately, this headmaster seems wildly unconcerned with anything but himself. You'll need to access the office while he's away.",
  "Guardian3_10212": "Welcome back.",
  "Guardian3_10213": "How do you do. I must say that I was not entirely surprised to learn that a student had been completing the trials.",
  "Guardian3_10214": "I've always believed Hogwarts students capable of anything they set their minds to.",
  "Guardian3_10215": "I am certain that you are more than capable of completing my trial.",
  "Guardian3_10216": "However, I must first – how shall I say – 'prepare' the location of your next trial.",
  "Guardian3_10219": "– a vainglorious and exasperating headmaster? Indeed I should.",
  "Guardian3_10220": "I shall confirm that everything is in order immediately.",
  "Guardian3_10223": "You must meet me in the Headmaster's office to begin the next trial – but make sure that the office is empty.",
  "Guardian3_10224": "As you know, light does not exist without shadow nor shadow without light. Simply because you can eliminate darkness does not always mean that you should.",
  "Guardian3_10225": "We understand that you are adjusting well to life at Hogwarts.",
  "Guardian3_10226": "I am glad  – especially in light of your unusual situation, starting as a fifth-year.",
  "Guardian4_10115": "Professor Rackham was right to have had faith in you.",
  "Guardian4_10116": "Few are capable of wielding it.  Hogwarts itself is a stronghold of ancient magic.",
  "Guardian4_10117": "But let us not get ahead of ourselves, Miss Morganach.",
  "Guardian4_10121": "<i>Avada Kedavra!</i>",
  "Guardian4_10122": "She’s alive.",
  "Guardian4_10123": "But, you are so – ",
  "Guardian4_10124": "Let us hear what the student has to say.",
  "Guardian4_10125": "We Obliviated Bragbor. He kept journals? Why would he have documented all of this? He didn't know what we were containing.",
  "Guardian4_10138": "I fear you are correct. The situation is far from ideal, but we can wait no longer. I will defer to Professor Rackham as to how to proceed.",
  "Guardian4_10140": "Isidora left memories for someone to find? You know what she did?",
  "Guardian4_10141": "Perhaps Professor Rackham was right to have had faith in you. I still have my reservations. Isidora, as you will see, was not who she seemed. I can only hope that you are.",
  "Guardian4_10143": "I am.",
  "Guardian4_10145": "Is it true? Has someone completed the first three trials?",
  "Guardian4_10147": "My memories should answer any questions you may have about the power you will need to protect.",
  "Guardian4_10148": "She was.",
  "Guardian4_10149": "I worry that you seem more intrigued than repulsed.",
  "Guardian4_10150": "It was disturbing. Although, I wonder that you are asking about her power.",
  "Guardian4_10151": "I hesitate to reveal the location of my Pensieve to someone who, perhaps, has yet to understand the responsibility of power.",
  "Guardian4_10152": "I see. Nonetheless, the knowledge you shall gain after you witness my memories is too valuable to share without further consideration.",
  "Guardian4_10153": "I shall require time to confer with the other Keepers.",
  "Guardian4_10154": "Now that you have witnessed my memory, you understand all that is at stake. Not everyone is what they seem.",
  "Guardian4_10155": "Isidora was not at her home.",
  "Guardian4_10156": "But – her father. Oh, Percival.",
  "Guardian4_10157": "It is as though he was stripped not only of his pain, but of all emotion.",
  "Guardian4_10158": "We must gather the others.",
  "Guardian4_10159": "Hello? Isidora?",
  "Guardian4_10160": "Isidora?",
  "Guardian4_10161": "Oh. Mr Morganach, I –",
  "Guardian4_10162": "Mr Morganach – ?",
  "Guardian4_10163": "I need you to return to your common room. All right?",
  "Guardian5_10078": "That’s going to take some getting used to.",
  "Guardian5_10079": "Professor Rookwood.",
  "Guardian5_10080": "I was actually hoping that you and the others might join me at my home this evening –",
  "Guardian5_10081": "Very well. I shall see you then.",
  "Guardian5_10082": "Wasn't it? And Percival needn't worry about the strands of emotion or the traces this magic leaves. I've found a way to contain all of it.",
  "Guardian5_10083": "Goblin silver.",
  "Guardian5_10084": "Don’t worry, he has no idea what we’re containing.",
  "Guardian5_10085": "Ugh. You sound like Percival.",
  "Guardian5_10086": "And, as it happens, I do know. It is a source of strength – of focus. Somehow, it enhances my ability to wield magic.",
  "Guardian5_10087": "I think we can harness it.",
  "Guardian5_10088": "You saw what I did for my father.",
  "Guardian5_10089": "Oh, Niamh. Imagine the good we could do. Everyone is in some kind of pain.",
  "Guardian5_10090": "Breathe it in. Can you feel it?",
  "Guardian5_10091": "You've kept this power to yourselves for so long because you fear it.",
  "Guardian5_10092": "I choose to embrace it.",
  "Guardian5_10093": "Everyone feels pain. And why? Because of your arrogance. Your obsession with secrets.",
  "Guardian5_10094": "Professor. You taught me to hone my power, not throw it away.",
  "Guardian5_10095": "Take a breath.",
  "Guardian5_10096": "They won’t suffer any longer. Not my father, not my students. No one.",
  "Guardian5_10097": "It did indeed.",
  "Guardian5_10098": "Magic. Left over from a spell I devised to remove pain.",
  "Guardian5_10099": "I need something much bigger.",
  "Guardian5_10100": "Perhaps not. But someone will be.",
  "Guardian5_10101": "But, if used correctly, its power can be used to do even more good.",
  "Guardian5_10102": "I only need to keep it safe until I can convince my colleagues of its worth. Magic like this unnerves some.",
  "Guardian5_10103": "I cannot bring my brother back, Father. But I can give you peace.",
  "Guardian5_10104": "On my travels, I confirmed that which I've always believed: that we have the power to take away pain.",
  "Guardian5_10105": "Do come in.",
  "Guardian5_10106": "Please, have a seat.",
  "Guardian5_10107": "We’re ready.",
  "Guardian5_10108": "I've something to show you.",
  "Guardian5_10109": "Father, these are my colleagues from Hogwarts.",
  "Guardian5_10110": "Father hasn't spoken since my brother died.",
  "Guardian5_10111": "On my travels, I confirmed that which I've always believed: that we have the power to take away pain.",
  "Guardian5_10112": "I took his pain.",
  "Guardian5_10113": "There’s much I’d like to share with you.",
  "Guardian5y11_10000": "You wanted to see me, Headmistress Fitzgerald? Professor Rackham?",
  "Guardian5y11_10001": "Professor Rookwood. Professor Bakar.",
  "Guardian5y11_10002": "I am.",
  "Guardian5y11_10003": "I recognised you all immediately. I cannot thank you enough for what you did.",
  "Guardian5y11_10004": "And, yes. I did see swirls of magic – everywhere – that day. My father insists it was my imagination running wild. But it was certainly real to me.",
  "Guardian5y11_10005": "I don’t understand. What are they?",
  "Guardian5y11_10006": "Ancient magic?",
  "Guardian5y11_10007": "So, if I can see traces of ancient magic, does that mean that I can wield it too?",
  "Guardian5y17_10000": "My father isn't getting better. I don’t think he’ll ever recover from the death of my brother.",
  "Guardian5y17_10002": "The drought was years ago, but the pain of losing him is as deep for him now as if it had happened only yesterday.",
  "Guardian5y17_10003": "He doesn't need pretty pillars. He needs peace.",
  "Guardian5y17_10004": "What if I could help him, Professor?",
  "Guardian5y17_10005": "It’s not enough. I want to take away his pain.",
  "Guardian5y17_10006": "So I’m to watch as my father's pain destroys him?",

  "HelenThistlewood_10059": "Expecto patronum!",
  "HelenThistlewood_10060": "Go. The cave. You're safe now. You have what you need. I'll be all right once I get –",
  "HelenThistlewood_10061": "What is it, Anne?",
  "HelenThistlewood_10084": "Wretched, vindictive girl that one. Apollonia claimed that Anne threatened to kill the boy after he broke her heart.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10086": "That poor soul. Never was the brightest girl, and that lack of wit proved to be her undoing.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10092": "I've escorted Ministers, professors, and many others to that blasted place. Never a student, I'll admit, but I will keep you safe.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10106": "(pained cry)",
  "HelenThistlewood_10107": "Nasty Dementors. Not even I could convince the Ministry to send them off. There's no need for such monsters.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10108": "Now, remember – Anne has been here a long time. The Dementors aren't kind. Have patience and speak to her quietly and respectfully.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10115": "I half suspect Jackdaw and Apollonia were merely toying with her. Who could have known he'd end up dead?",
  "HelenThistlewood_10118": "Do keep your wits about you.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10123": "I'm pleased you came. Uncle Eldritch believes the book you found – and its missing pages – may be relevant to an unsolved case from my time as an Auror.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10125": "Decades ago, a student named Richard Jackdaw disappeared after going to meet a girl named Anne. They never found his body.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10129": "Anne's 'alibi' was somewhat – labyrinthine.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10135": "If you – a student with a connection to the pages like Jackdaw had – spoke to Anne, she might reveal new information.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10136": "This is wonderful news. You are to be commended for your kindness and bravery.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10137": "I fear not. She cannot leave. And a student like you may provide the impetus she needs to save herself.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10138": "I suppose it has a peculiar appeal to some, but it can be terribly disconcerting.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10139": "Fortunately, being a retired Auror has its benefits. We can Apparate right to her.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10142": "Steady yourself. We'll Apparate together.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10143": "Don't worry, I've never splinched anyone.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10151": "That ought to keep them at bay for now. Though, be aware – you may feel a wave of despair. It will pass.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10152": "This really is a dismal place. But we'll be out of here soon enough. Now, follow me.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10154": "I would never suggest so drastic a measure if I did not feel it was necessary.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10155": "I must admit it's nice to be back home among friends and family. Another year in the Ministry would have done me in.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10157": "Indeed. What can I do for you?",
  "HelenThistlewood_10158": "Welcome to Upper Hogsfield. I'm Helen Thistlewood. What brings you to our charming hamlet?",
  "HelenThistlewood_10159": "Indeed I have. I recently retired from my career as an Auror. Travelled all over the world on behalf of the Ministry.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10160": "How can I help you today?",
  "HelenThistlewood_10161": "Stop in any time. You always have a friend in Upper Hogsfield.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10162": "Unfortunately, there's not much I'm allowed to tell you – the Ministry won't permit it.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10163": "Enough to know there's darkness in unexpected places. I'd encourage you to be vigilant, and not give the Dark Arts a second thought.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10165": "I will say that there was more than one occasion on which the wizarding world was saved by well-trained Aurors.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10168": "Indeed. Unfortunately, I'm unable to tell you more about that. Or anything else at the moment. Must be off.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10169": "That's right. I'm sorry, but I can't chat right now. My brother Eddie's always one for a good chat.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10170": "Charming compared to a lot of other places, I can tell you.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10171": "When his headless ghost appeared briefly in Hogsmeade, wholly unaware of how he died, Anne was convicted of his murder and sent to Azkaban.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10174": "The Black family's power over certain people in the Ministry, along with the fact that Anne is Muggle-born, sealed her fate.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10175": "She's not held up well in Azkaban. (sigh) In some ways she blames me for not proving her innocence. I'd like to clear her name if we can.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10176": "I'll be right here – out of sight. Simply talk to her.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10177": "If my great-uncle is to be believed, yes. At least that's what the portraits at Hogwarts suspect.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10180": "Anne insisted that Jackdaw had asked her to follow the map with him, but only after she solved a series of puzzles he'd prepared.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10181": "Without Jackdaw's puzzle, pages, or remains, Anne was sent to Azkaban based solely on Apollonia's spurious testimony.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10182": "It was in large part due to the testimony of a girl called Apollonia Black. Jealous of Anne, I think.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10183": "She swears she never even solved the first puzzle, so they didn't meet. Jackdaw's ghost vanished almost as soon as he appeared.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10184": "I have no idea. Evidently, he was always a bit restless – going on and on about adventure.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10185": "If I had to guess, he tired of Scotland and is somewhere on the other side of the globe by now.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10186": "I believe Anne may have solved the first puzzle by now. But, after spending time in Azkaban, she's a shadow of her former self.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10187": "She said Jackdaw promised her adventure – following a map he found on some pages he'd stolen from Peeves.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10188": "Odd way to woo a girl.",
  "HelenThistlewood_10189": "She won't speak to anyone she doesn't trust, and she trusts no one.",

  "HyacinthOlivier_10005": "Head rat. My guess is that if someone were to take out Selwyn, the rest of the Ashwinders would disperse.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10006": "But Selwyn is a skilled wizard. I certainly can't take care of him myself. Believe me, I wish I could.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10008": "Goodness, no! I'd never ask a student to confront Selwyn.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10011": "The Ashwinders have settled themselves in a castle near here – and they're antagonising Cragcroft.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10012": "I'm offering a bounty to anyone that can take out their leader, Silvanus Selwyn, so they'll all leave.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10013": "I only want Cragcroft to go back to normal. I'm tired of living under the thumb of Selwyn and his cronies.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10014": "You defeated Selwyn?",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10015": "Merlin's beard! A student took down one of Rookwood's top filth.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10016": "The thieves will finally leave us alone, thanks to you.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10017": "Something must be done about the vile thieves who've infested the area.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10018": "The Ashwinders cannot be allowed to run roughshod over our way of life.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10019": "I'm at my wits' end.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10020": "Then I suppose this bounty is yours. Well-deserved.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10021": "What a snide little rat. No sense of honour. You're worse than the Ashwinders.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10022": "Fine. I can give you a bit more. But our business is finished. It's time for Cragcroft to live in peace.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10025": "– disrupting not only our sense of peace, but our valuable trade.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10027": "Selwyn's one of Rookwood's lieutenants. Not quite as terrifying as Theophilus Harlow, but a menace nonetheless.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10028": "Clagmar Castle's along the south coast. South and to the west of here.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10029": "They're not your typical thieves and extortionists. Not that typical thieves and extortionists are lovely company.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10031": "Have you heard any news about Silvanus Selwyn?",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10032": "Take your money and get out. I may be glad to be rid of Selwyn, but I don't want to see your face around Cragcroft.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10033": "You're welcome in Cragcroft any time. It's such a pleasant place when it's not being threatened by Ashwinders.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10034": "You're lucky the rest of Cragcroft is so welcoming. I'm tempted to rid us of you myself.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10035": "We're all very grateful for what you did. Still can't believe you rid Cragcroft of that rat Selwyn.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10037": "But I'm offering a nice bounty on his head. Feel free to put the word out.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10038": "They would not leave poor Bella Navarro alone. She'd given them everything, but still they kept threatening her.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10039": "She was ready to go back to her family in Italy. Almost lost her livelihood. They are ruthless.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10040": "Hopefully they're improving their skills, and not running errands for Rookwood.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10041": "They'd better not be taking that Graphorn to poachers.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10042": "No good's coming of a youngster on a Hippogriff, mark my words.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10043": "Partial to night clothes, are we?",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10044": "What would cause a troll to enter Hogsmeade like that?",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10045": "Perhaps the Ashwinders will see Ranrok's defeat as a message; a sign of what's to come for them.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10046": "Never use the Dark Arts. There is no circumstance that warrants it.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10047": "Hm. I'm sure you're simply being – enterprising.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10049": "Probably shouldn't do that again.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10050": "Best keep your eyes up.",
  "HyacinthOlivier_10051": "Won't sneak up on anyone doing that.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10001": "I do miss the views from the Ravenclaw common room.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10002": "Please don't forget to use the Floo Flames. I invented Floo powder for a reason, you know.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10003": "Always good to see you.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10004": "Good morning. If you prefer a good evening, I can make that happen.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10005": "I've always said that travel broadens the mind.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10006": "How nice to see you, my young friend.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10007": "Handy resource indeed, your Field Guide. I'm most pleased to be included.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10008": "You can't imagine how inconvenient travel was before I invented Floo powder.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10009": "Off on another adventure, are we?",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10010": "What are you up to now?",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10011": "Travel is always much more enjoyable with a friend.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10012": "Safe travels, my young friends.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10013": "Intrepid travellers, the both of you. Keep your wits about you.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10014": "Where are the two of you headed? No. Don't tell me. I shall see you there.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10015": "You two seem ready for adventure.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10016": "Lovely to see you both.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10017": "Welcome!",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10018": "This looks intriguing.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10019": "I do hope you enjoyed your journey.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10020": "Lovely to see you here.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10021": "There you are.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10022": "Glad to see you making good use of my Floo Flames.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10023": "Welcome to Upper Hogsfield! Charming hamlet. Don't tell the residents of Lower Hogsfield I said that.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10024": "Ah, Lower Hogsfield! One of my two favourite Hogsfields. Lovely this time of year.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10025": "Now you shall be able to travel to and from Feldcroft in an instant. If you see dear Anne Sallow, please do give her my best.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10026": "How nice to see you here. (sigh) Isn't the sea air refreshing?",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10027": "Intriguing place, San Bakar's Tower. Lovely view, I'd imagine. No idea who this 'Bakar' is, mind you.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10028": "Ah, Aranshire. This hamlet is simply crawling with life.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10029": "Bainburgh is one of my favourite hamlets in the area. Deadly charming.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10030": "Ah, Brocburrow. Always a lovely place to visit. Give my best to either of the Thistlewoods if you see them. Or both!",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10031": "You've found the Floo Flames in Cragcroft. Well done. Keep an eye out for the Lord of the Shore. I shan't say more.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10032": "You'll enjoy your time in Irondale. Shame about Padraic's sister",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10033": "Always been keen on Keenbridge. Hang on to your valuables, that's all I'll say.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10034": "I'm glad to see you found your way to Pitt-upon-Ford. Delightful place. Despite the little Dugbog problem.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10035": "A veritable gem in the Highlands, Marunweem. Welcome.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10036": "Ah! It's a new day.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10037": "Things are much clearer in the daylight, I always say.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10040": "Ah! Glad to see you won't be travelling alone.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10042": "It's always nice to share one's journey with a friend.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10046": "Can't wait to see what trouble the two of you can get into.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10047": "You two are certain to make your mark today.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10048": "Good to see a fellow Ravenclaw. Gryffindors aren't the only ones with a taste for adventure, you know.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10057": "I shall pretend I cannot see you.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10058": "Ahem. If I can see you, the prefects might be able to as well. Be careful.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10060": "I can never get enough of the castle.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10061": "I adore the hustle and bustle of Central Hall.",
  "IgnatiaFlooTravel_10062": "How lovely to hear the bells ringing at Hogwarts again. So pleased someone took the time to restore them.",

  "ImeldaReyes_10344": "But for some reason, now people think you're competition. I can't be having that.",

  "ImeldaReyes_10349": "Everyone knows that class is only for beginners, troublemakers and bumbling baboons.",

  "ImeldaReyes_10357": "I’d hate to face Professor Hecat in a duel.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10358": "(cheers)",
  "ImeldaReyes_10359": "I'd wager nobody's been in there for years. We could prove our mettle – unless you're too scared.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10360": "Wasn't expecting to stumble upon a skeleton.  Thankfully, we're more competent than they clearly were.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10361": "Don't fret if you run out of ingredients. I simply grow most of what I need.",

  "ImeldaReyes_10381": "He should've listened to me.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10382": "Ah! I know who you are. You're the new Slytherin, the one who barged in with Professor Fig last night.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10383": "I'm Imelda, by the way. Shame I wasn't with you and Fig. I could've lured that dragon away. My skills on a broom are legendary.",

  "ImeldaReyes_10386": "Precisely.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10388": "Perhaps one of these days I'll show you a thing or two about flying. I can teach you more than Kogawa ever could.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10394": "Told you.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10395": "Speaking of which, I'd like to get in some time on my broom before classes.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10396": "Not going to move there, are you?",
  "ImeldaReyes_10397": "I wouldn't do that if I were you –",
  "ImeldaReyes_10398": "If you do that, you'll lose. Trust me.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10399": "Ehhh. Might want to think again.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10400": "Nice meeting you.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10401": "Not really. Much too sedate a pastime for me.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10402": "Also, it's simply not that challenging. The moves are always so obvious. Why does no one else see it?",
  "ImeldaReyes_10403": "I make the time.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10404": "There's nothing like swerving through the spires of the castle and around the Quidditch pitch to clear the mind.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10406": "I hope one of those other things is practising your flying.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10407": "You can always try to beat my record again. It won't be easy.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10408": "Interesting tactic on your first day – taking all the attention away from the first-years.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10409": "Suit yourself. Come and find me if you change your mind.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10410": "I'm far too busy practising my flying to keep up with this or that elixir. Priorities.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10411": "Careful. I'm as good with a wand as I am with a broom.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10441": " Well done, Garreth!",
  "ImeldaReyes_10442": "Enough of this. Only one way to find out who's the better flyer.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10445": "Calm yourself, Violet. I'm sure smelling a bit sulphurous for a day or so won't damage your popularity.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10461": "How daft do you have to be to fall down a well?",
  "ImeldaReyes_10462": "You see one tree you've seen them all. But is that the one from the treasure map you found in that well?",
  "ImeldaReyes_10463": "Hmm. Following floating candles, are we? Into the Forbidden Forest, no less? Fine.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10464": "I suppose the Forbidden Forest's not so bad after all, if you can just find treasure lying about.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10468": "We'd better find something here.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10469": "Wherever the map leads I hope we're the first ones there.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10470": "There wasn't another vest in there, was there?",
  "ImeldaReyes_10471": "I bet I could move in and around those rocks with no effort.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10524": "Hmm. Never know what you'll find in a tree these days.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10533": "Stalling, fifth-year? Fine. I'll humour you.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10534": "Let's see what you've got.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10538": "Leander, like all Gryffindors, your confidence is spectacularly misplaced.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10539": "You'll not make the leaderboards. I promise you.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10540": "Hmph. Seems Adelaide did have good reason for being so upset during Beasts.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10541": "Adelaide mentioned her uncle Rowland's camp may lie near Brocburrow – past the river.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10542": "If this is Mr Oakes's campsite, we're in for trouble.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10543": "Should we be bold or discreet? There's more than one way to enter.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10544": "If Mr Oakes was here, there's no sign of him now.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10545": "Oakes is an experienced trader. He marked that map for a reason.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10546": "His journal left behind? This can't be good.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10547": "I know this castle. Can't believe it's been taken over by Loyalists.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10548": "Blast. A part of me hoped it'd be cheerier on the inside.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10549": "Boiler doors usually need to be lit to operate. This one's probably no exception.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10550": "That furnace could be promising.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10551": "Try lighting that furnace. It must be connected to the boiler door.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10552": "I saw a boiler door on our way down. Perhaps we should take a closer look there.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10567": "Ha! Did he now? Still tinkering with his broom upgrade no doubt.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10568": "I tried to help him once. He nitpicked my flying technique and that was the end of that. The nerve.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10569": "Caught wind of you showing off in Flying Class with Clopton.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10570": "Why is he roping you into his broom testing silliness? You've barely started flying, from what I know.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10573": "This course demands focus – requires you to anticipate speed and height before every turn.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10575": "Since Black cancelled Quidditch, it was these courses or nothing. I made them popular again. Got the whole school hungry to compete.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10576": "I'll be unrivalled at the next course.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10577": "But don't get your hopes up. The next course near Irondale offers a much tougher challenge.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10578": "Just check in at the podium – where the leaderboard is. You can check your time and start the race.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10579": "Anyway – I'm moving on to the next course. It's near Irondale and offers a much tougher challenge.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10580": "You can try to prepare by racing this course again.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10583": "Mr Oakes was lucky. Ranrok's lot would never have freed him.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10584": "I saw movement higher up in the keep. We should find our way there.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10585": "A ladder – that's what we need.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10588": "So, let's see what you've got, fifth-year.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10589": "The others test stamina. Three courses in all – built ages ago by former students.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10590": "Good luck. You're going to need it.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10600": "We need to find the tomb near Brocburrow and place Samantha's family crest on a sarcophagus there.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10601": "Seems our feet haven't been cursed. That's a good sign, I suppose.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10602": "I was not expecting to find a troll here. Although I shouldn't be surprised.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10603": "Samantha will be glad to hear that the crest has been returned. I certainly hope it reverses the curse.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10604": "While they sit around and hope to be the best, I put in hours of practice.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10605": "Compliments make people soft. No one goes round telling me I did a fine job, and do I care? No.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10606": "No one sets records by wishing for them. And I need strong competition to stay on top of my game.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10607": "So please: try to beat my record, fifth-year. And don't be disappointed when you lose.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10608": "I say I'm the best and that's all I need.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10609": "– you'll not have the same luck on the south coast course.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10612": "Hmph. If you must know, I've had to deal with jealousy from members of my own house.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10613": "I half expected you to back down – rest on your laurels.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10614": "When we were first-years, Nerida Roberts and I spent loads of time on our brooms. Pledged to fly every day.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10615": "As my skill on a broom grew, rapidly, I might add, Nerida suddenly didn't have time for flying practice.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10616": "Poor thing. Spends all her time now dawdling by the lake, obsessed with merpeople. Won't even learn to swim.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10617": "I refuse to downplay my talents to coddle someone else's fragile ego.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10618": "I suppose we know what happened to Mary Portman now. She was breeding the spiders.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10619": "I tried to give her pointers, but she didn't have the natural ability I did. Clearly, she was jealous.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10620": "Obviously. Evidently too far for most of our classmates. Pathetic.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10621": "Good.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10622": "Glutton for punishment, I gather.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10623": "To race this course again. Visit the podium with the leaderboard – where you can start the race and check your time.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10624": "They should be begging me to keep these trials alive, not running scared.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10627": "This must be Aranshire. We'd better keep an eye out for spiders.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10628": "A ladder. Not sure I want to know where this leads.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10629": "That's the last of the spider sacs.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10630": "I hope that's the last spider.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10631": "Well done. I believe it's dead.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10632": "You'll have to do better than that if you want to top my time.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10633": "I wouldn't call it that, no. Just chatter between friends. That's all. Now. Care to try again?",
  "ImeldaReyes_10634": "Of course. Get out there.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10635": "Of course. This time trial is all about quick reactions and focus.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10636": "This course is all about testing your ability to focus. Each turn requires a decision. Make one, then commit to it.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10637": "Good luck.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10642": "Impressive work today. But don't get too comfortable. I'll be on your heels in no time.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10643": "I'll race them myself. Don't want to get rusty. But I won't be dealing with time trials.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10644": "You're welcome to run them too.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10645": "It has been fun. Glad you're here, fifth-year.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10646": "Anyway. Hope we find time to fly again soon.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10647": "You could say that. My grandfather played Quidditch for Puddlemere United, and my father –",
  "ImeldaReyes_10648": "Well, he was a Chaser for Slytherin, but had to stop after a curse took his knees out. Said it was the Gryffindor Beater.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10649": "And me – I fell in love with flying the first time I saw the ground disappear beneath my feet.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10650": "Something about the freedom you feel on a broom. I've not been able to stop since.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10651": "My family's not going to believe the news when I tell them. They're almost as competitive as I am. Almost.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10652": "I'm my father's girl – a Chaser through and through. You'd know that if Black hadn't cancelled  Quidditch this year.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10653": "As for a team, it's the Holyhead Harpies I've always dreamt of.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10654": "When I'm finished with school, I'll try out. If for some reason, I don't get accepted – I don't know what I'll do.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10655": "Herbology, perhaps? Because if that did happen – you might as well pot me and call me a Mandrake. I'd never stop screaming.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10656": "You take care of yourself.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10657": "This is not one to rush.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10661": "See this crowd? All my doing.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10674": "Hmph. If you must know, I've had to deal with jealousy from members of our house.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10675": "Anyway. I need to ready the next course. Stop by when it's ready – if you can handle it.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10676": "Not bad for a Gryffindor.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10677": "Not bad for a Ravenclaw.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10678": "Not bad for a Hufflepuff.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10679": "You're an asset to our house.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10682": "Be on your guard.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10686": "You really held your own.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10687": "Well done back there.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10688": "Having a wee nap over there?",
  "ImeldaReyes_10689": "That the best you've got?",
  "ImeldaReyes_10690": "That must have hurt.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10691": "Easily managed.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10694": "Don't make a sound.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10695": "Stay quiet.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10708": "Where did you even learn that spell?",
  "ImeldaReyes_10709": "Why would you want to use that kind of magic?",
  "ImeldaReyes_10710": "Can't say I approve of that.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10713": "Someone's not holding back.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10714": "Why are you doing that?",
  "ImeldaReyes_10715": "About time you got your own broom.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10716": "Much better broom.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10717": "New broom? Won't help your chances against me.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10718": "It's locked.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10719": "I bet we could unlock that.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10755": "We've been spotted!",
  "ImeldaReyes_10756": "Heads up!",
  "ImeldaReyes_10757": "I think they saw us.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10758": "Do you think they saw us?",
  "ImeldaReyes_10759": "They've spotted us. What should we do?",
  "ImeldaReyes_10768": "Feel better?",
  "ImeldaReyes_10769": "I bet that's a relief.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10770": "We need to keep on our guard.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10771": "Don't let them see you.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10772": "Careful now.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10800": "Don't let them see you.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10801": "Stay completely silent.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10802": "Don't let them hear you.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10806": "Save the fighting for the Loyalists.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10807": "You didn't need to do that.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10811": "Those Ashwinders aren't as fierce as they think.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10812": "The poachers are no match for us.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10813": "We're going to bring down Ranrok's Loyalists one goblin at a time.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10814": "No more spiders, please.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10815": "Not even a troll can defeat us!",
  "ImeldaReyes_10832": "Careful – could be trouble.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10833": "Be ready for a fight.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10834": "Look out.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10837": "I'm in the mood for this.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10838": "Don't let your guard down.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10839": "Be prepared for a fight.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10840": "Are you hurt? You don't look well.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10841": "Perhaps take something to stay healthy.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10844": "Hold on – I'm coming!",
  "ImeldaReyes_10845": "I'll make you better, don't you worry!",
  "ImeldaReyes_10846": "There you go.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10847": "Good thing I'm here.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10857": "Impressive.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10858": "You really are something, aren't you?",
  "ImeldaReyes_10859": "I'll never tire of seeing you do that!",
  "ImeldaReyes_10863": "Wish I could ride my broom all the time.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10864": "Nothing better than flying a broom.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10865": "Riding a Graphorn? Now I've seen everything.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10866": "I bet I could outfly a Hippogriff on my broom.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10867": "Forget your uniform?",
  "ImeldaReyes_10868": "Professor Fig has some strange beliefs about magic if you ask me.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10869": "Professor Fig died defending our school. Doesn't get more noble than that.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10870": "Why would you use that spell?",
  "ImeldaReyes_10871": "I can't stand that spell.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10873": "Watch it!",
  "ImeldaReyes_10874": "What are you doing?",
  "ImeldaReyes_10900": "Oh! Trip, did you?",
  "ImeldaReyes_10901": "Oh, hello.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10902": "Nice to bump into you.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10903": "Having fun, are we?",
  "ImeldaReyes_10908": "Looks as if someone was paying attention in Defence Against the Dark Arts!",
  "ImeldaReyes_10931": "Credit where it's due. (sigh) You are a rather good flier.",
  "ImeldaReyes_10932": "Beginner's luck, I say. You'll not beat me next time.",
  "IndiraWolff_10002": " I haven't had a normal conversation with anyone for a while, so pardon me if I'm a little rusty.",
  "IndiraWolff_10005": "Hello again, what can I do for you?",
  "IndiraWolff_10017": "It may not be as fine as what you'd find in Hogsmeade, but I think we have a certain rustic charm all of our own.",
  "IndiraWolff_10018": "My father passed away recently and I've been completely occupied with keeping the business afloat.",
  "IndiraWolff_10019": "I hadn't realised how much work went into running a shop: inventories, maintenance, customers, bills, accounts – and on and on.",
  "IndiraWolff_10021": "We sell all sorts of beast byproducts for potion-making. Some of the rarer stuff too. That all falls on me now.",
  "IndiraWolff_10024": "Yes, but just the one, I'm afraid. Running the shop keeps me rather busy. I'm the new proprietor, Indira Wolff.",
  "IndiraWolff_10031": "There's a Rampant Dugbog on the loose. It's more aggressive than others, and has some peculiar markings.",
  "IndiraWolff_10032": "You took care of that Rampant Dugbog! We're all so very grateful. Now life is as idyllic as it ever was.",
  "IndiraWolff_10033": "It's making life miserable in Pitt-Upon-Ford. I wish someone would do something about it.",
  "IndiraWolff_10034": "Not quite the attire I was expecting.",
  "IndiraWolff_10035": "The Dark Arts have no place here.",
  "IndiraWolff_10037": "We'll have no more of that.",
  "IndiraWolff_10038": "Hello, and welcome! Nice to see you.",
  "IndiraWolff_10039": "Oh, you'll like that. I guarantee it.",
  "IndiraWolff_10040": "Exactly what I needed. Thank you.",
  "IndiraWolff_10041": "That costs a bit more than you have, I'm afraid.",
  "IndiraWolff_10042": "Thank you for your business. Hope you'll come and see me again.",
  "IndiraWolff_10043": "Do you know what you might be looking for?",
  "IndiraWolff_10044": "Oh, didn't mean to get in your way.",
  "IndiraWolff_10045": "You certainly took care of that.",

  "IskoAbril_10040": "Your friend, Natty, was not able to summon my wand. It must be blocked by something.",
  "IskoAbril_10041": "Well done. I knew it was nearby.",
  "IskoAbril_10042": "Now, you'd best stand back. One never knows how a curse will react to being broken.",
  "IskoAbril_10052": "These locks are cursed, and there's an Anti-Apparition Jinx on the cells. Even Natty's skill with wandless magic cannot free us.",
  "IskoAbril_10053": "I need my wand for this. Using one with which I have no connection may not work as well or as quickly. And we cannot risk detection.",
  "IskoAbril_10054": "It's nearby. I can sense it.",
  "IskoAbril_10055": "And thank you, my friend. We owe our lives to your bravery.",
  "IskoAbril_10056": "I may be too weak to Disapparate with you both, but I can try.",
  "IskoAbril_10057": "Very well, but be careful. Thank you, my young friends.",
  "IskoAbril_10058": "You spoke with my wife? How is she?",
  "IskoAbril_10059": "I am all right. Thank you for coming.",
  "IskoAbril_10060": "My pleasure.",
  "IskoAbril_10062": "Any luck with my wand? Please – you must find it, quickly.",
  "IskoAbril_10064": "I need you to find my wand.",
  "IskoAbril_10065": "Hello! It's good to see you, my friend. If it wasn't for you, I might still be caged up by those dreadful Ashwinders. I will never forget your bravery.",
  "IskoAbril_10066": "Over here. I need your help.",
  "IskoAbril_10067": "Won't trifle with you anymore.",
  "IskoAbril_10068": "That's some impressive flying. Can't give all the credit to the broom, now, can we?",
  "IskoAbril_10069": "Riding a Graphorn? That's a fine way to get yourself hurt, I'm afraid.",
  "IskoAbril_10070": "Never ridden a Hippogriff myself. Looks like a fair bit of fun.",
  "IskoAbril_10071": "Not what I would have worn today, but – if you're comfortable –",
  "IskoAbril_10072": "Never thought I'd see the day when a troll would be so bold as to attack Hogsmeade. If they'll do that, who knows what they're capable of?",
  "IskoAbril_10073": "The world is definitely a safer place for wizards and witches alike now that Ranrok has been dealt with. So much anger there.",
  "IskoAbril_10074": "Oh, no, no. Never use that spell. Come now – certainly you know better than that.",
  "IskoAbril_10075": "<i>Alohomora</i>. I've used that plenty of times myself. Rather useful as spells go.",
  "IskoAbril_10077": "You ought to be more cautious. That spell can do quite a lot of damage. I've seen it many times.",
  "IskoAbril_10078": "You all right? You're going to get yourself hurt hurrying around like that.",
  "IskoAbril_10079": "Well done. I knew it was nearby.",
  "IskoAbril_10080": "Now, you'd best stand back. One never knows how a curse will react to being broken.",
  "JalalSehmi_10002": "Let's see. I am Lower Hogsfield's pre-eminent potioneer, but I was once a lowly Hogwarts student, like you.",
  "JalalSehmi_10003": "I sell only potions and their ingredients. If you can't fix it with a potion then it's best left broken, I say.",
  "JalalSehmi_10005": "There's a thief on the loose by the name of Catrin Haggarty. She's an Ashwinder.",
  "JalalSehmi_10006": "A goblin called Pergit is causing a bit of a stink. His gang is attacking travelling vendors and now business is suffering everywhere.",
  "JalalSehmi_10008": "In fact, I'll give you the Hogwarts discount. It's the standard price.",
  "JalalSehmi_10009": "What can I do for you?",
  "JalalSehmi_10010": "It would be nice if someone would do something about it. No one wants to pick a fight with a band of goblins, though.",
  "JalalSehmi_10011": "She's stealing everything that's not nailed down and people have had enough.",
  "JalalSehmi_10012": "I heard that you took care of Catrin Haggarty. How good of you! Now people will have more money to spend in my shop.",
  "JalalSehmi_10013": "The main rumour is that you solved the problem of Pergit. That's wonderful! Business around town should improve very much now.",
  "JalalSehmi_10014": "My ingredients are all local to this area, and my potions are brewed to keep you healthy and safe.",
  "JalalSehmi_10015": "You may have noticed we have a bit of a rivalry with Upper Hogsfield.",
  "JalalSehmi_10016": "Not much to it, but we're still the better of the two Hogsfields. And better than most other places too.",
  "JalalSehmi_10017": "Hello! I'm Jalal Sehmi and this is my potion shop. I can answer any questions you have about the town.",
  "JalalSehmi_10018": "My prices are low enough already, you see.",
  "JalalSehmi_10019": "Catrin's hiding in a camp just southwest of town.",
  "JalalSehmi_10020": "Which means he's free to do what he wants down in Korrow Ruins.",
  "JalalSehmi_10022": "Visit Jalal's shop. Jalal has all you might need in the way of potions.",
  "JalalSehmi_10023": "Your attire is definitely unique.",
  "JalalSehmi_10024": "Aren't you the student who ran all those goblin Loyalists off? I can't tell you what a relief that was to everyone in Lower Hogsfield.",
  "JalalSehmi_10025": "Oh, you're one of the students who had Theophilus Harlow sent to Azkaban. It's wonderful to finally have that man locked up where he belongs.",
  "JalalSehmi_10026": "Aren't you one of the students who saved little Archie Bickle from Rookwood's lot? Such a noble thing to have done.",
  "JalalSehmi_10027": "Dark Arts? No, no, no.",
  "JalalSehmi_10029": "Please – no more of that.",
  "JalalSehmi_10030": "Hello! Come on in.",
  "JalalSehmi_10031": "Ah, yes – a wonderful choice.",
  "JalalSehmi_10032": "I'll have no trouble selling this. Thank you.",
  "JalalSehmi_10033": "Oh, dear. Not enough money, I'm afraid. Very sorry.",
  "JalalSehmi_10034": "I hope to see you again some time.",
  "JalalSehmi_10035": "What can I help you with today?",
  "JalalSehmi_10036": "Oh, dear. Pardon me.",
  "JalalSehmi_10037": "Making yourself known, aren't you?",
  "JasperTrout_10119": "Oi! I'd normally toss the both of you out –",
  "JasperTrout_10120": "– but I like the look of the fancy man. Target practice!",
  "JasperTrout_10124": "Hmmph. Welcome to the Hog's Head. Any empty seat is yours.",
  "JasperTrout_10125": "We may not be scholars, but you could've at least got yourself dressed.",
  "JasperTrout_10126": "If you learned that in here, you keep it to yourself.",
  "JasperTrout_10128": "Is this really the place for that?",
  "JasperTrout_10129": "Come on in – ignore the smell of goat.",
  "JasperTrout_10130": "You can come in here, but don’t start any trouble you can't finish.",
  "JasperTrout_10131": "Mind yourself.",
  "JasperTrout_10132": "That the best you can do?",

  "JemimaCollins_10009": "We'll be seeing you again.",
  "JemimaCollins_10010": "Can it be true? Two Hogwarts students escaped the Poacher Pack on Hippogriffs? That's brilliant.",
  "JohannaBickle_10107": "Archie, I don't have time to argue. I've told you repeatedly not to stray far from home – especially when I'm inside with your little sister.",
  "JohannaBickle_10108": "That's enough. I'm too tired for your stories today. You stay right here where I can see you.",
  "JohannaBickle_10109": "Now, why don't you do some more drawings for me? Mm?",
  "JohannaBickle_10139": "Oh, Archie! You're here! You're safe.",

Before they touched ground again he was cleanly separated.

Most of us had no time to react. I and a few others took to a roof, without having time to take hold of our wands. We were stranded up there for what seemed an eternity.\n\nSometimes we could scare them off. Sometimes. Those eyes. Lifeless, evil eyes. Eight of them. When they’re towering over you, all you see is your own fear multiplied eight times. That and their fangs, shiny with venom. One by one the spiders picked us off. The victims’ screams were awful. Pierced my soul like a blade, hearing my neighbours coming to such a gruesome end. Not dissimilar to a Dementor’s Kiss I would imagine. The silence was a relief. We wished them a quick death, and for ourselves too, if it came to it. Especially then. \n\nFinally, a witch flew by low in the air and spotted us, stranded. By then all that was left was me and Dogsbody Pete. \n\nAnyway, we survived. But sometimes we wish we hadn't. I shall be haunted forever.",

  "LenoraAbbott_10547": "Ranrok's gone, but perhaps his Loyalists did make some important statements about goblin rights.",
  "LenoraAbbott_10548": "The Dark Arts? Unthinkable!",
  "LenoraAbbott_10549": "I hope you know what you're doing.",
  "LenoraAbbott_10551": "You shouldn't be doing that near me.",
  "LenoraAbbott_10552": "It's a relief to finally have an answer as to why that portrait was empty.",
  "LenoraAbbott_10553": "Mind yourself.",
  "LenoraAbbott_10554": "You'd never catch me behaving like that.",
  "LeonaPeck_10000": "Ah! Welcome to Brood and Peck, I'm Ellie Peck. And before you ask, I'm out of Abraxan hair.",
  "LeonaPeck_10001": "Always have trouble collecting them m'self as the bird keeps disappearing, cheeky thing.",
  "LeonaPeck_10007": "Used to carry them in the shop, Diricawls.",
  "LeonaPeck_10008": "But people kept asking for their money back when they'd get home and the blasted things'd be nowhere in sight.",
  "LeonaPeck_10009": "There's worse, trust me. Most of the suppliers of Fwooper feathers may as well be living in St Mungo's.",
  "LeonaPeck_10010": "Not surprising, I s'pose; the cry on those things, oh! but such marvellous feathers. Almost worth going mad for.",
  "LeonaPeck_10011": "Well, you don't mind sharing your opinions, do you?",
  "LeonaPeck_10012": "Despite the fact we're a wizarding village, doesn't mean these things appear by magic.",
  "LeonaPeck_10013": "Takes a lot to round up these feathers. Don't get me started on Fwoopers.",
  "LeonaPeck_10014": "Most of the suppliers of Fwooper feathers may as well be living in St Mungo's.",
  "LeonaPeck_10015": "Oh, you are well and cheeky, aren't you? Don't worry, I don't mind. Never had a still tongue in my head either.",
  "LeonaPeck_10016": "Now, why don't you have a good look around. Stocks change all the time, and not just because they disappear.",
  "LeonaPeck_10017": "Truer words never spoken.",
  "LeonaPeck_10018": "Always best to pop in whenever you can to get things before they run out.  Which they used to literally do.",
  "LeonaPeck_10019": "Used to carry beasts themselves. Good business it was, but had it up to here with parents grumbling.",
  "LeonaPeck_10020": "Not my fault if the little ones caught a flea off a Kneazle. Oh, you should've heard them. No! Best with byproducts.",
  "LeonaPeck_10025": "Anyway, perhaps you should have a look around. Stocks change all the time, and not just because they disappear.",
  "LeonaPeck_10032": "Anyway! What are you here for? Mooncalf fur? Diricawl feathers?",
  "LeonaPeck_10033": "Take all the time you need. And thank you for stopping by. A treat to have you here.",
  "LeonaPeck_10034": "And I do like to make sure the beasts are safe and well cared for. Couldn't guarantee that with some of these prospective 'owners'.",
  "LeonaPeck_10035": "And I'll have you know that it's my highest priority to ensure that all  beasts are safe and well cared for. Right thing to do – and good for business.",
  "LeonaPeck_10036": "You don't need to do that. Don't choose that path.",
  "LeonaPeck_10037": "I'd have lived in a nightshirt if they'd have let me.",
  "LeonaPeck_10038": "I always feared he'd come into my place, Harlow. Feared for him I mean.",
  "LeonaPeck_10039": "Dodgy magic. Stop that.",
  "LeonaPeck_10041": "I shan't be standing for any threatening behaviour, I can tell you that.",
  "LeonaPeck_10042": "Hello. Mind you don't turn quick. If you're stuck with a Diricawl feather it doesn't half hurt.",
  "LeonaPeck_10043": "Come in. Sorry if there's a smell. New batch of toad hide.",
  "LeonaPeck_10044": "You can never go wrong with those. Good choice, I'd say.",
  "LeonaPeck_10045": "I don't mind selling things for certain clients. You know where to find me.",
  "LeonaPeck_10046": "Well. I see. Judging by what's left in your coin purse I'd say your last purchase was a Niffler.",
  "LeonaPeck_10047": "I'll not mind seeing you here again. Consider yourself welcome.",
  "LeonaPeck_10048": "My trade relies on the likes of you doing the right thing when it comes to beasts. Thank you.",
  "LeonaPeck_10049": "Now, what sorts of beast byproducts might you be looking to acquire?",
  "LeonaPeck_10050": "It's like having a troll around here.",
  "LeonaPeck_10051": "The lot of it was bought up by a trader in Ottery St Catchpole. Made me take it in person, they did. No care that I had to shut the shop!",
  "LeonaPeck_10052": "Apparently had a bad experience with someone shipping them hair from a Wampus cat.",
  "LeonaPeck_10053": "Must've been someone from America no doubt 'cause we don't even have them here.",
  "LeopoldBabcocke_10043": "That I do, but – what's a student like yourself doing out here? Got yourself lost, did you?",
  "LeopoldBabcocke_10044": "Aye, nice to break the routine now and then.",
  "LeopoldBabcocke_10045": "Name's Leopold Babcocke. And I am indeed here to sell.",
  "LeopoldBabcocke_10046": "I wouldn't dare set foot in a place like the Forbidden Forest without a steady supply.",
  "LeopoldBabcocke_10047": "What do you say, my young friend? A measure of safety for the path ahead?",
  "LeopoldBabcocke_10048": "No, of course not. Never meant to imply otherwise.",
  "LeopoldBabcocke_10049": "Now, for someone like yourself who is also prone to wander, I cannot understate the importance of keeping some Wiggenweld potion on hand.",
  "LeopoldBabcocke_10050": "Bit of a wanderer myself, in fact.",
  "LeopoldBabcocke_10051": "Aye! Let me know if you see something you like.",
  "LeopoldBabcocke_10052": "Perhaps a visit to garment shop might be in order.",
  "LeopoldBabcocke_10053": "Pleased to see Arn has his belongings back. Ranrok and his Loyalists will think twice before trying that again.",
  "LeopoldBabcocke_10054": "Theophilus Harlow should have foreseen the repercussions of associating with the likes of Victor Rookwood.",
  "LeopoldBabcocke_10055": "Dark Magic will not be tolerated here.",
  "LeopoldBabcocke_10057": "Careful, now.",
  "LeopoldBabcocke_10058": "Hello there. Welcome.",
  "LeopoldBabcocke_10059": "Thank you for your patronage.",
  "LeopoldBabcocke_10060": "I shall hope to do business with you again.",
  "LeopoldBabcocke_10061": "Ah, it appears you don't have the funds. Pity.",
  "LeopoldBabcocke_10062": "It's been a pleasure.",
  "LeopoldBabcocke_10063": "See if there's something you need.",
  "LeopoldBabcocke_10064": "Ahem.",
  "LeopoldBabcocke_10065": "Dear me – everything all right?",
  "LethiaBurbley_10000": "Now, was it two pinches of Anjelica or three?",
  "LethiaBurbley_10001": "There was something else too – a dash of powdered bat spleen I think.",
  "LethiaBurbley_10002": "I think there were Doxy Eggs as well, but surely those would curdle.",
  "LethiaBurbley_10003": "That's the last time I have a potion idea that I don't write down.",
  "LethiaBurbley_10004": "That was it! Half a bottle of Flabberghasted Leech, stirred clockwise.",
  "LethiaBurbley_10005": "That's it. Work out your aggression.",
  "LethiaBurbley_10006": "I wish I'd been painted in my nightgown.",
  "LethiaBurbley_10008": "Off to see Professor Fig? Ferdinand tells us the two of you are quite close.",
  "LethiaBurbley_10009": "Poor thing. Was always stuck to Fig like a shadow.",
  "LethiaBurbley_10010": "Grateful the goblins weren't out to destroy fine works of art.",
  "LethiaBurbley_10011": "Ooh – somebody likes a dark spell.",
  "LethiaBurbley_10013": "How very rude.",
  "LethiaBurbley_10014": "That cheese potion really could have used more Brie I think.",
  "LethiaBurbley_10015": " That'll teach me not to write my recipes down.",
  "LethiaBurbley_10016": "Hm – but if I substituted Moondew for Moon seed –",
  "LethiaBurbley_10017": "Why Aesop refuses to let me lecture a potions class is absolutely beyond me.",
  "LethiaBurbley_10018": "Aesop Sharp would get a lot further with his students if he didn't terrify them all.",
  "LethiaBurbley_10019": "Would've finished that potion hours ago if the Fat Lady hadn't decided to pop in.",
  "LethiaBurbley_10020": "Is that a pimple on your chin? You should really brew something for that.",
  "LethiaBurbley_10021": "I sincerely hope I'm not moved to the library. That's where Ferdinand hangs.",
  "LethiaBurbley_10022": "Dear me, was it Acromantula Venom or Aconite? I really should write these things down.",
  "LethiaBurbley_10023": "Hm – I don't have cat hair  but perhaps a Kneazle hair will do?",
  "LethiaBurbley_10024": "Now, was it two pinches of dragon horn or dragon dung?",
  "LethiaBurbley_10025": "If you see Sir Cadogan, please tell him his pony's mane potion is ready.",
  "LethiaBurbley_10026": "Don’t suppose you've got any bat spleen handy? Tricky potion this –",
  "Lodgok_10207": "Now before you set off, do you have any questions?",
  "Lodgok_10215": "I will remain here, eagerly awaiting your return. Please, be careful.",
  "Lodgok_10217": "It inspired greatness – that is, until it was no longer ours. Then it became something else.",
  "Lodgok_10232": "The helmet shines even more brightly than I imagined! The etchings, the contour of the profile. Remarkable.",
  "Lodgok_10271": "From what I know of wizard magic, that shouldn't be too difficult to achieve.",
  "Lodgok_10272": "The door will not open while the eye can see you. You and your friend must be invisible to it to gain access.",
  "Lodgok_10282": "Remain unseen to pass through the enchanted doorway to the mine. Once inside, study any plans you may find.",
  "Lodgok_10285": "I will await your return.",
  "Lodgok_10287": "Troubling news, indeed.",
  "Lodgok_10326": "I shall see you soon.",
  "Lodgok_10333": "And I'm unable to join you because I cannot risk anyone reporting my presence to Ranrok.",
  "Lodgok_10334": "Enough! Please do not tell me that was meant to be Gobbledegook.",
  "Lodgok_10335": "Pronunciation is not the issue. I barely recognised that as language. I trust you can read Gobbledegook better than you can 'speak' it?",
  "Lodgok_10336": "You speak Gobbledegook?",
  "Lodgok_10421": "The foul creatures thrive on darkness and the cold. Vanquish them with light, force – and most effectively, fire!",
  "Lodgok_10422": "Ah, and there it is. The witch's tomb.",
  "Lodgok_10433": "You received my owl. Good, good.",
  "Lodgok_10436": "Bah. You're looking at what it is, rather than what it means. To most goblins, this is more than a mere helmet.",
  "Lodgok_10467": "Just 'Lodgok.' Thankfully, we only need someone who can decipher written plans, since I cannot join you in the mine.",
  "Lodgok_10480": "Considering a Dark witch was involved, I suppose there's a chance you may encounter the Dark protectors known as Inferi.",
  "Lodgok_10482": "We need some idea of what Ranrok knows or is plotting. I suspect a careless Loyalist may have left plans behind.",
  "Lodgok_10488": "Can I help you with something?",
  "Lodgok_10489": "You look familiar.",
  "Lodgok_10494": "Ranrok and I had a – falling out – a while back. The relic could well repair the chasm between us.",
  "Lodgok_10496": "Gather whatever supplies you may need and meet me near the witch's tomb.",
  "Lodgok_10498": "She did, did she? Did she send you with news?",
  "Lodgok_10501": "To think those wretched thieves have their hands on such a relic.",
  "Lodgok_10502": "Goblins believe that the rightful owner of any object is its maker, not its purchaser.",
  "Lodgok_10503": "I wish you luck retrieving the helmet. As a wand-carrier, you should have an advantage.",
  "Lodgok_10505": "Damn. They got here first. We need to get it before Rookwood uses it to further ingratiate himself to Ranrok.",
  "Lodgok_10508": "I had heard this. When the dark-hearted conspire, they seldom make their full intentions clear to one another.",
  "Lodgok_10509": "I can only speculate, but I imagine their alliance is uneasy and quite fragile.",
  "Lodgok_10510": "Well done. This is sure to impress Ranrok.",
  "Lodgok_10511": "Thank you. This should earn Ranrok's trust. I will take it to him immediately. It may distract him from his search.",
  "Lodgok_10513": "Yes, of course.",
  "Lodgok_10518": "I came to stop this.",
  "Lodgok_10519": "No!",
  "Lodgok_10520": "You're wrong, Ranrok –",
  "Lodgok_10521": "I was bringing it to you.",
  "Lodgok_10544": "Thank you, Sirona.",
  "Lodgok_10545": "Thank you, Sirona.",
  "Lodgok_10546": "Now I remember. The Three Broomsticks – day of the troll attack. You're the student he's after.",
  "Lodgok_10547": "Let's say I did know. Why should I trust you?",
  "Lodgok_10548": "Hmm. Well, if Sirona trusts you –",
  "Lodgok_10549": "Years ago, a heinous witch stole a sacred goblin relic. Rumour has it that it now rests in her sarcophagus –",
  "Lodgok_10550": "– in a tomb accessible only by wizardkind.",
  "Lodgok_10551": "Hmm. Well, if Sirona believes we have common goals, then it is possible that we can trust each other.",
  "Lodgok_10552": "Very well. I may know of something that could help us both. A way to get Ranrok to confide his plans to me.",
  "Lodgok_10553": "We will have to trust each other. I that you will not abscond with the relic and you that I'll share what I learn.",
  "Lodgok_10554": "A valuable heirloom known as the 'Helmet of Urtkot.'",
  "Lodgok_10555": "The witch considered herself a collector and purchased the helmet as a trinket. She cared not what pain she caused the goblins.",
  "Lodgok_10556": "The differences between our kinds are myriad.",
  "Lodgok_10557": "It may surprise you to know that I do not believe those differences always to be insurmountable.",
  "Lodgok_10558": "It is the reason I find myself travelling with you to this tomb today.",
  "Lodgok_10559": "I do hope our alliance proves fruitful. Again, I wish you luck.",
  "Lodgok_10560": "A symbol of what has been lost – of all that wizardkind has taken from us.",
  "Lodgok_10561": "Reclaiming it would mean a great deal to goblinkind – and to Ranrok. He would be grateful to me should I return it.",
  "Lodgok_10562": "The Helmet of Urtkot is an ancient and storied relic, forged during a time of unity among the goblin clans.",
  "Lodgok_10563": "Let us hope that ours is less so.",
  "Lodgok_10564": "I saw one of their campsites not far from here. But I fear you must go in alone. My fighting days are behind me.",
  "Lodgok_10565": "Get to that helmet before Rookwood does or we will lose our chance at any leverage – no matter how small – with Ranrok.",
  "Lodgok_10566": "Unfortunately, we have no time.",
  "Lodgok_10567": "Good. There's no time to lose.",
  "Lodgok_10568": "It – it is merely an inkling. You have impressed me greatly, friend. I am glad that I trusted you.",
  "Lodgok_10569": "We shall speak soon. Best to keep our arrangement quiet for now. Many will not believe that our aims might possibly be aligned.",
  "Lodgok_10570": "My plan with the helmet failed. But I have another idea. I think we may be able to find what we need at a goblin mine south of Hogwarts.",
  "Lodgok_10571": "Damn Bragbor and his blasted journals.",
  "Lodgok_10572": "Large, magically fortified receptacles crafted from goblin metal.",
  "Lodgok_10573": "Ranrok recruited others to help me locate the repositories.",
  "Lodgok_10574": "He cares about what they contain.",
  "Lodgok_10575": "For centuries, wizards have refused to share their magical knowledge with goblins. Your kind will not even let us carry wands.",
  "Lodgok_10576": "Not long ago, Ranrok sent me to collect a recently unearthed set of Bragbor's journals.",
  "Lodgok_10577": "An ancestor of Ranrok’s. Renowned metal-worker. If we are to work together, I suppose I must tell you more.",
  "Lodgok_10578": "That is where we began our search.",
  "Lodgok_10579": "We were to search anywhere that was connected to five names mentioned in the journals: Rackham, Fitzgerald, Bakar, Morganach and Rookwood.",
  "Lodgok_10580": "Ranrok was convinced that the repositories contained a magical power that wizards wanted to keep for themselves.",
  "Lodgok_10581": "Thus, many goblins, myself included, have spent our lives mistrusting wizardkind.",
  "Lodgok_10582": "They described ‘repositories’ that Bragbor had been commissioned to build for a group of witches and wizards.",
  "Lodgok_10583": "He was – is – determined to take it for goblinkind. But he's –",
  "Lodgok_10584": "All you need do is not be seen – either by the eye above the enchanted door or a loitering Loyalist.",
  "Lodgok_10585": "Of course. Unfortunately, presenting Ranrok with the Helmet of Urtkot did not have the effect I'd hoped.",
  "Lodgok_10586": "Because he knew the details surrounding its plunder, he presumed I'd had help from a witch or wizard in retrieving it.",
  "Lodgok_10587": "I'm afraid we do not have the luxury of rational expectation when it comes to Ranrok.",
  "Lodgok_10588": "I fear you are correct. Other than Rookwood Castle, however, I do not know where else he plans to search.",
  "Lodgok_10589": "Yes?",
  "Lodgok_10590": "I expected Rookwood Castle to be deserted when I arrived to begin my search, so was surprised to find a witch there who had set up some sort of improvised research site.",
  "Lodgok_10591": "She was studying something so intently that she almost didn't notice me.",
  "Lodgok_10592": "When she looked up, I thought she would react with fear –  or disdain – but instead she did something that I will never forget.",
  "Lodgok_10593": "Without a moment’s hesitation, she smiled and asked me to sit with her.",
  "Lodgok_10594": "She wanted to work together.",
  "Lodgok_10595": "Yes. But how did you –?",
  "Lodgok_10596": "Ah. The reverence with which she talked of goblins and their intelligence and skill – it caught me entirely off guard.",
  "Lodgok_10597": "I had never been treated with such respect by a witch or wizard – so, to my surprise, I let her study the container if she would allow me to search the castle on my own.",
  "Lodgok_10598": "More of Ranrok’s recruits arrived and we began to dig – eventually locating the first repository.",
  "Lodgok_10599": "Ranrok was thrilled with our discovery, but furious when I told him about Miriam. Berated me for trusting a witch.",
  "Lodgok_10600": "When I heard she had been killed –",
  "Lodgok_10601": "I don’t want to believe it, but – I don’t know.",
  "Lodgok_10602": "After that, something shifted in me. I had seen how the power from the repositories was transforming Ranrok – transforming all of them.",
  "Lodgok_10603": "I could no longer remain a part of it.",
  "Lodgok_10604": "I tell you all of this so that you understand what is at stake. Ranrok never found all of Bragbor’s journals.",
  "Lodgok_10605": "What you've discovered here today worries me deeply. If Ranrok learns of the location of that repository, I fear we shall be destined for a great war.",
  "Lodgok_10606": "I will find out what Ranrok knows.",
  "Lodgok_10607": "Watch for my owl.",
  "Lodgok_10608": "She was certain it was made of goblin metal but was unable to open it.",
  "Lodgok_10609": "She told me that she was a researcher, and showed me a small, oddly-shaped container with a strange symbol on it.",
  "Lodgok_10610": "We parted ways with her promising to share what she'd learned.",
  "Lodgok_10611": "But the ones he did find suggest that Bragbor at some point built a repository far greater in size than the one beneath Rookwood Castle.",
  "Lodgok_10612": "I found one of Ranrok's drills in a mine along the shore. I intend to destroy it. I'm tired of trying to reason with him. You are welcome to join me. But if I don't see you there, I will reach out when I return. I have something to give you.",
  "Lodgok_10614": "You did the thieves a service by recovering it. I know many a goblin who would have killed for it.",
  "Lodgok_10615": "I'm afraid there's no choice but to stop them. Go to their camp, and deal with them at once.",
  "Lodgok_10616": "Meet me there. And bring someone who speaks Gobbledegook.",
  "Lodgok_10617": "Such vestments do little for one's safety.",
  "Lodgok_10618": "I caution use of such wicked spells.",
  "Lodgok_10620": "Stop that at once!",
  "Lodgok_10621": "Mind your step.",
  "Lodgok_10622": "Seems rather disrespectful, don't you think?",
  "Lodgok_10623": "Good. There's no time to lose.",
  "Lodgok_10624": "Don't!",
  "LottieFeatherbottom_10018": "Oh, well this is a new one. Not bothering to get dressed.",
  "LottieFeatherbottom_10019": "I'd never had a run-in with him m'self. Not with Harlow. But if he'd ever laid a finger on my Bertram he'd have known it.",
  "LottieFeatherbottom_10020": "Get that filthy magic away from me before I hex you.",
  "LottieFeatherbottom_10022": "You do that again, you'll feel fifty beaks on your crown.",
  "LottieFeatherbottom_10023": "Ahoy, young sprite. Be with you in a minute.",
  "LottieFeatherbottom_10024": "Oh, I do beg your pardon.",
  "LottieFeatherbottom_10025": "The world doesn't prosper when there's idle hands like yours wrecking the place.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10001": "If Sebastian vouches for you, that's all I need to know.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10005": "It's not senseless at all. It requires teamwork, reflexes, and spell-casting.  You might like it if you tried it.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10006": "Besides, in Crossed Wands you can duel with a partner if you like.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10010": "So, care to step into the ring?",
  "LucanBrattleby_10012": "Come back when you're feeling up to it, if ever.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10013": "Spectacular. Let the fireworks begin!",
  "LucanBrattleby_10015": "Ah, look who's back.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10016": "I coordinate duels for Crossed Wands, a duelling club of sorts. It's invitation only, so you must have really impressed Sebastian.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10017": "You show up, I match you with other duellists, and whoever is still standing in the end wins.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10019": "Your first time I'll pair you with Sebastian. Next time, you'll need to bring a partner along or duel alone.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10020": "It's our way of determining the school's greatest duellists, once and for all.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10021": "Imagine it's quite something to see the two of you duel.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10023": "Then you've come to the right place.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10024": "So, care to try your luck again?",
  "LucanBrattleby_10026": "Nice work! Sebastian wasn't wrong about you.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10027": "There's strong competition ahead, but keep this up and you could be the next school champion.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10028": "I shall.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10031": "Now, it takes time to organise these duels, but check with me later. I may have something lined up for you.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10032": "Again, congratulations on your first Crossed Wands victory. Well-fought.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10034": "Hope to see you back here again.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10035": "That looked painful. Care to try another round?",
  "LucanBrattleby_10036": "Brilliant.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10037": "Suit yourself.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10039": "You may begin!",
  "LucanBrattleby_10040": "Glad you're back.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10041": "Why yes, it is. I've got a great match lined up.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10042": "Ready for another round?",
  "LucanBrattleby_10043": "Ready to redeem yourself?",
  "LucanBrattleby_10045": "Fine, but don't take too long making up your mind.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10046": "Bravo!",
  "LucanBrattleby_10047": "You did indeed.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10050": "The other duellists have already taken notice of you, but after that last round they'll really have it in for you.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10051": "I'll let you know when we're ready. Hope to see you then.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10052": "Oof. Glad I didn't bet on you that round. Care to go again?",
  "LucanBrattleby_10053": "Glad to hear it.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10054": "Very well. We'll be waiting when you're ready.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10055": "The next round is for all the Gobstones, so to speak.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10056": "Good news! We have a new training dummy on which you can practise spell combinations – and you're up for round two of Crossed Wands.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10057": "Future champion coming through.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10058": "Big match today.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10062": "Ready for a shot at glory?",
  "LucanBrattleby_10063": "Then let's get started!",
  "LucanBrattleby_10064": "Very well. Don't take too long though.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10065": "Ready to redeem yourself?",
  "LucanBrattleby_10066": "Look who's back.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10067": "What a victory! You've won the tournament!",
  "LucanBrattleby_10068": "And we're pleased to have such a gracious champion.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10069": "Please. You wouldn't have got this far on luck alone.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10070": "If the best duellists in the school weren't enough competition, then perhaps you should consider transferring to Durmstrang.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10071": "Now, to the victor goes the prize!",
  "LucanBrattleby_10073": "You earned it. You are a duellist to be reckoned with.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10075": "Come now, you're the undisputed winner! You should revel in your accomplishment.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10076": "Now that we've definitively crowned a tournament winner, I suppose I should get back to my school work.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10077": "Wonder how my Herbology plants are doing. I haven't tended them in ages.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10078": "To Crossed Wands!",
  "LucanBrattleby_10079": "(shiver) They made a Crup's breakfast out of you that round. Care to try again?",
  "LucanBrattleby_10080": "Very well. Good luck out there.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10081": "Understandable, but don't take too long. We'll be waiting.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10082": "It's time to prove your duelling mettle and see if we've a new school champion.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10083": "Very well.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10084": "Surely you can best a dummy.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10085": "It's just a dummy. You're more than capable.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10086": "You're coming along!",
  "LucanBrattleby_10087": "Practice makes perfect.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10088": "That's what I like to hear!",
  "LucanBrattleby_10089": "I agree.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10090": "Ready to have a try now?",
  "LucanBrattleby_10091": "Suit yourself. I'll be around when you're ready.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10092": "Be sure to cast all your spells before the dummy lands.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10093": "That's it.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10094": "Nicely done.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10095": "Good one.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10096": "Excellent form.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10097": "You'll get it.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10098": "Next time, perhaps.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10099": "That was – something.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10100": "Keep trying.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10101": "Already? But you haven't finished the training exercise.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10102": "Good. Give it to the old dummy!",
  "LucanBrattleby_10103": "Very well. I'll be here when you're ready.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10104": "I'd say that's enough practice. You looked good out there.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10105": "And, as a fully 'initiated' member, you now have access to the official Crossed Wands training dummy.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10106": "In fact, the second duel is ready when you are.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10107": "Care to go again?",
  "LucanBrattleby_10109": "I say better to discover one's weaknesses during practice than during a duel. You'll be a fearsome challenger now!",
  "LucanBrattleby_10115": "Very good way to master spell combinations. Come and see me and I'll set it up.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10116": "When you're ready for either, come and find me in the usual place.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10117": "And so it is my great honour to present you with this simple yet elegant token of supreme duelling accomplishment.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10118": "Meet me at the usual place for the final round of Crossed Wands. Also, the training dummy is still available.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10119": "Care to try again?",
  "LucanBrattleby_10120": "Of course. I'll fetch it and give you a list of combinations to practise.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10121": "Excellent idea. This time will be a bit more of a challenge. Ready?",
  "LucanBrattleby_10122": "Wonderful. I'll set things up. Remember to cast all the spell combinations before the dummy lands again.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10123": "That's fine. Come and find me when you're ready.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10124": "Glad you're keeping at it. Shall I fetch the dummy?",
  "LucanBrattleby_10125": "Impressive wandwork. I'd hate to face you in a duel.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10126": "Oh, stop. Don't make me blush.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10127": "True, but it's a difficult dummy. Believe me, I know.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10128": "Seriously, well done. Training dummies will think twice before challenging you again.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10129": "Plus – you'll be even more formidable in Crossed Wands. Other duellists had better beware!",
  "LucanBrattleby_10130": "If you need to stop practising before you finish all of them, let me know.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10131": "If you need to stop practising before you finish all of them, let me know.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10132": "Brilliant. Are you duelling with a partner?",
  "LucanBrattleby_10133": "Then let's get to it.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10134": "Brilliant. Are you duelling with a partner?",
  "LucanBrattleby_10135": "Even though you won the tournament already, I'm glad to see you haven't stopped training. Stay sharp, my friend.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10136": "Glad you're keeping at it.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10137": "It all comes down to this. The moment that we find out if your training and dedication is enough to win it all.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10138": "You'd better keep practising if you want a chance at winning, or at least surviving, the next round.",
  "LucanBrattleby_10139": "Can I help you?",
  "LucanBrattleby_10140": "And, to liven things up, the winner is awarded a prize. Interested?",
  "MagicalWell_10000": "Excuse me? (cough) Hello?",
  "MagicalWell_10001": "Hello? (cough) Is anyone there?",
  "MagicalWell_10002": "(cough) Ahem. Ahem. Is someone there?",
  "MagicalWell_10003": "(cough) Can you help me?",
  "MagicalWell_10012": "'Down there?' I beg your pardon. I'm here. (cough) There's no one here but me.",
  "MagicalWell_10016": "Aaaaaah. Thank you. Thank you. What a relief. I hope the map serves you well – at least better than it did me.",
  "MagicalWell_10017": "(cough) Can you help me?",
  "MagicalWell_10018": "Ahem. Some thoughtless wretch casually tossed a bit of parchment into me and (cough) it caught.",
  "MagicalWell_10019": "If you could please take it? (cough)",

  "MahendraKapoor_10886": "Caught a glimpse of Ronen's notes – looks like he's planning a lesson on the Mending Charm. Best get studying.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10000": "May I have a moment of your time?",
  "MarianneMoffett_10001": "I was. I'm Marianne Moffett.  Pleasure. At the moment I'm having a great deal of trouble trying to find a particular Diricawl.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10002": "I'm worried about a large albino Diricawl known as 'Gwyneira.' She's a local legend, so of course poachers are after her.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10005": "Oh, hello. Any luck finding Gwyneira?",
  "MarianneMoffett_10006": "That's incredible! Was it terribly difficult?",
  "MarianneMoffett_10007": "Thank you so much for bringing me Gwyneira. I shall keep her safe and only use her feathers sparingly.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10011": "One last thing – she seems to spend her days in hiding. I've only ever seen her at night. I do hope you're able to save her.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10013": "Peculiar things, aren't they? Did you know that Muggles call them dodos? Such a funny name.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10014": "It's a magical bird. Muggles call it a dodo and believe the creature to be extinct. But that's because it can disappear whenever humans draw near.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10015": "I can't seem to rescue her. And I'm worried the Diricawls don't trust me since I've been hanging about their den.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10016": "Oh, thank you. (sigh) Those gorgeous feathers.  And she'd be safe.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10019": "Don't be so humble about it.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10020": "Believe me, I know.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10021": "Well? May I have her now?",
  "MarianneMoffett_10022": "You're too kind.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10023": "I suppose that's fair. I'm well aware of how difficult she must have been to catch.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10024": "She has such exquisite plumage. Oh, I shall make the finest attire from her feathers.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10026": "Be prepared to chase her. I sometimes wonder if she actually enjoys the pursuit.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10028": "If I had her, I'd treat her like a queen. And I could use her moulted feathers as fashion accessories.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10029": "But it was my idea to rescue her! I'm the one who fell in love with her beautiful plumage!",
  "MarianneMoffett_10030": "Oh, the cheek! Now what shall I do? Without her feathers I can't finish any of my fashion designs.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10033": "And she'll have a good life too, of course. (contented sigh)",
  "MarianneMoffett_10034": "Gwyneira is special. She's more attractive to poachers, with her lovely plumage. They'll try harder to take her.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10035": "It's down by the shore, on a sort of overhanging cliff. You'll recognise it by all of the Diricawls lolling about.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10036": "Of course. There's a particular Diricawl, called Gwyneira, that the poachers are after. She's unusually large, pure white, and very elusive.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10037": "She seems to only appear at the Diricawl den at night. If you could bring her to me, I could keep her safe.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10038": "You traitorous fowl-napper! I hope she pecks your eyes out.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10039": "The other Diricawls seem to have managed evading poachers quite well on their own.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10040": "The perfect place is with me. Wait until the neighbours see her. Not to mention how fashionable I'll be with those beautiful feathers.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10041": "Indeed! They'd pluck her feathers and likely kill her when they were through.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10044": "Why on earth are you wearing those?",
  "MarianneMoffett_10045": "No, no. The Dark Arts have no place here.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10047": "I'd rather you didn't do that, if you don't mind.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10048": "Hello – and welcome.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10049": "You won't regret buying that, I assure you.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10050": "Marvellous! This won't last long in my stocks.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10051": "You don’t have enough money, I'm afraid.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10052": "I've enjoyed your visit. Do come by again soon.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10053": "Can you tell me what you had in mind?",
  "MarianneMoffett_10054": "Oh! My apologies.",
  "MarianneMoffett_10055": "Took care of that, didn't you?",
  "MatildaWeasley_10650": "Good morning. I trust you're ready for your first day at Hogwarts?",
  "MatildaWeasley_10663": "And here we are. Quite the time saver. These stairs lead directly to Central Hall.",
  "MatildaWeasley_10812": "Ah! There you are.",
  "MatildaWeasley_10817": "Welcome. You're just in time. Have a seat.",
  "MatildaWeasley_10824": "As Deputy Headmistress, it is my distinct honour to show you to your common room. Right this way.",
  "MatildaWeasley_10828": "The password is – 'Grata Domum.'",
  "MatildaWeasley_10834": "I shall be back in the morning to collect you for your first class.",
  "MatildaWeasley_10835": "You're welcome. I hope you enjoy your first night at Hogwarts. Sleep well.",
  "MatildaWeasley_10838": "It's quite uncommon for a student to begin as a fifth-year. Might be a bit of a challenge, but one I'm sure you're up for.",
  "MatildaWeasley_10841": "Well done.",
  "MatildaWeasley_10846": "I shall be back in the morning to collect you for your first class.",
  "MatildaWeasley_10847": "You're welcome. I hope you enjoy your first night at Hogwarts. Sleep well.",
  "MatildaWeasley_10851": "It's quite uncommon for a student to begin as a fifth-year. Might be a bit of work, but I'm sure that's never stopped you before.",
  "MatildaWeasley_10859": "I shall be back in the morning to collect you for your first class.",
  "MatildaWeasley_10860": "You're welcome. I hope you enjoy your first night at Hogwarts. Sleep well.",
  "MatildaWeasley_10863": "It's quite uncommon for a student to begin as a fifth-year. It may be a bit of a challenge, but one I'm sure you're up for.",
  "MatildaWeasley_10865": "In order to enter, one must simply speak the correct password –",
  "MatildaWeasley_10871": "I shall be back in the morning to collect you for your first class.",
  "MatildaWeasley_10872": "You're welcome. I hope you enjoy your first night at Hogwarts. Sleep well.",
  "MatildaWeasley_10936": "Glad to hear it. Mr Sallow is a capable young wizard and he knows the area.",
  "MatildaWeasley_10937": "Excellent choice. Miss Onai is one of our most talented students and she knows the area.",
  "MatildaWeasley_10943": "Vanish that pile up ahead, if you'd be so kind.",
  "MatildaWeasley_10951": "Excellent work.",
  "MatildaWeasley_10966": " There's no chance I'm clambering over this mess. Hmm –",
  "MatildaWeasley_10967": "This presents the perfect opportunity to teach you <i>Evanesco</i> – the Vanishing Spell.",
  "MatildaWeasley_10969": "The Vanishing Spell should work.",
  "MatildaWeasley_10970": "Go on, cast <i>Evanesco</i>.",
  "MatildaWeasley_10976": "He's been at Hogwarts longer than I have and seems to know its every nook, cranny, and secret.",
  "MatildaWeasley_10977": "We discovered this room together, when I was a student.",
  "MatildaWeasley_10986": "You have the resources needed to conjure both a potions station and a potting table.",
  "MatildaWeasley_10994": "Deek will be here to answer any questions you may have. Do not underestimate his insights.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11109": "Ah, Deek. We've been looking for you.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11111": "Deek has been a friend since I was a second-year.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11112": "We discovered this room together.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11113": "I mentioned you to Deek. We believe that you might be able to benefit from this room like I did.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11114": "Deek, would you be so kind?",
  "MatildaWeasley_11115": "Come along. Best not dawdle.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11116": "This way.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11117": "Lots to do. Follow me.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11134": "Well done. You can use these whenever you need to brew potions or grow plants.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11156": "How are your students getting along this year?",
  "MatildaWeasley_11157": "Is that so?",
  "MatildaWeasley_11158": "Yes, well. It's still early. Perhaps they'll improve.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11171": "I certainly would have appreciated something like the Field Guide when I was a student.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11172": "Using the Guide will also train you to be alert to your surroundings.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11173": "Ah. The Guide appears to have some information for you about that painting of poor Baruffio.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11194": "Walk with me and we shall put it to the test.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11195": "Perhaps seeing it in action will answer any questions you may have.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11199": "Is that – ? goodness. My old school bag. I wondered where that had got to. Can't believe it's still here.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11223": "Settle down, settle down.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11224": "Transfiguration, as you may be weary of hearing me say, is an exact science that can take a lifetime to master. But we needn’t be daunted.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11225": "Almost anything can be transformed, if you can just perceive the potential within it – as I see in all of you, tremendous witches and wizards, every one of you.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11226": "Or it could just be my eyesight.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11229": "Beautifully done.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11233": "Please conjure a potions station and a potting table. You'll find both useful in your studies.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11307": "Class is dismissed.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11333": "Now, you all know what to do.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11366": "Good work. Shall we move on?",
  "MatildaWeasley_11380": "A rather unsavoury local. Best to avoid him and his associates – including his 'right hand' of sorts, Theophilus Harlow – if you can.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11394": "And Mr Ollivander will connect you with the perfect wand.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11396": "J. Pippin's Potions stocks a wide array of potions ingredients, although they rarely sell recipes.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11400": "I trust your first classes went well?",
  "MatildaWeasley_11464": "I look forward to seeing what you do with the space.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11465": "Professor. A word, please?",
  "MatildaWeasley_11466": "Hello, Professor Black.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11528": "I remember the first time I entered the Gryffindor common room after being sorted.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11534": "'Aspiration'.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11535": "You must tap the barrel, two from the bottom, middle of the second row, in the rhythm of Hel-ga Huff-le-puff.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11536": "I am a Gryffindor.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11554": "Professor. I need to speak to you.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11567": "I shall join you shortly.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11568": "I'll be right behind you.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11569": "This should only take a moment. Feel free to explore.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11575": "'A wonderful job?' 'Leeway' for Professor Fig? I shall never understand that man.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11577": "Excuse me, Headmaster.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11578": "If I may: one particular student's heroism during the attack on Hogwarts, not to mention the level to which they have excelled in their coursework, as a new student, no less –",
  "MatildaWeasley_11668": "Cheeky little thing.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11669": "Oh, the joy of flying upon a Hippogriff.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11678": "It warms my heart to see your interest in Herbology, dare I say, 'blossom.'",
  "MatildaWeasley_11683": "Well. You do look – comfortable.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11691": "You seem to have found a mentor in Professor Fig. I'm sure he has much to teach you.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11692": "I'm terribly sorry about Professor Fig. He was an extraordinary wizard – and friend.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11693": "What a terrifying encounter with the goblins. We're lucky to have survived.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11695": "We mustn't judge all goblins for the actions of a single army. Still – they shan't be attacking this school again.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11707": "You'll find plenty of items of clothing that need to be identified. The desk will be an invaluable resource.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11708": "I was thinking the same thing, Deek. Perhaps you could help –",
  "MatildaWeasley_11718": "Now, where is Deek? He must have sneaked past and gone ahead.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11724": "I did. We haven't had a chance to speak since – ",
  "MatildaWeasley_11728": "No. It won't. But I can assure you that he would want us to press on – and that he would rest easy knowing that the future of the wizarding world is in hands like yours.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11739": "I know you were quite close with Professor Fig.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11776": "You can get almost anywhere in the castle quickly from Central Hall.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11803": "After much discussion with the Headmaster and the Department of Magical Education at the Ministry, we've devised something extraordinary to ensure your success.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11804": "It is a Wizard's Field Guide. It will help you to keep track of what you’re learning so that you master all that’s expected of a fifth-year.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11807": "You would be wise to take full advantage of this exceptionally valuable resource.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11811": "Do keep up.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11815": "This way.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11816": "The Guide will give you opportunities to practise your magic – and educate yourself about wizarding lore.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11818": "Here you are.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11836": "Regardless, you must continue to build upon what you've learned.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11848": "She'll keep you well clear of any of Victor Rookwood's undesirables en route.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11849": "Once you've finished Professor Ronen's assignment, your friend will meet you at the castle doors.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11852": "Well, you are here. Make the most of it. You only have one first day at Hogwarts.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11853": " Perhaps some explanation is in order?",
  "MatildaWeasley_11854": "One – at a time, please.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11855": "<i>Levioso!</i>",
  "MatildaWeasley_11856": "Now, in future, perhaps we can spend our time on more meaningful activities than causing a commotion.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11859": "This way, please. I have more to show you.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11860": "We're going this way, not that way.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11861": "Do try not to get distracted.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11862": "No time to waste. Let's continue onwards.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11865": "Where in Merlin's name is that elf?",
  "MatildaWeasley_11867": "Now, in light of your unique situation, joining us as a fifth-year, you'll need to catch up with your classmates – and not fall behind.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11885": "Please meet me in the Transfiguration classroom when you are finished with your classes for the day. I've one more thing to discuss with you.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11896": "Especially as you'll be expected to complete your O.W.L.s at the end of the year.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11897": "Yes. Your Ordinary Wizarding Level exams. They will determine what type of career you can have when you leave here.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11913": "Clever, isn't it? Keep your eyes open for more opportunities like that – inside and outside of the castle.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11918": "Your Field Guide contains a map of the castle. Open it up and find Central Hall.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11919": "Forgive me, the Headmaster stopped me and I –",
  "MatildaWeasley_11920": "Merlin's beard. I see you've wasted no time. Well done.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11921": "Shall we?",
  "MatildaWeasley_11923": "Please meet me in the seventh-floor corridor as soon as you can. I have an idea for somewhere you can focus on your studies – away from prying eyes and distractions.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11924": "Professor Sharp asked that they have a couple of particular recipes on hand for you.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11925": "I'll just take a quick look at this – give you an opportunity to explore on your own until we locate Deek.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11926": "I wouldn't want to see you lose house points. Although, I will say excellent toad. Got a good spring to him.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11937": "Splendid. Now, cast <i>Evanesco</i> on those chairs.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11959": "Yes. The magic of creating – or conjuring – objects. I'll teach you.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11965": "It can identify unfamiliar items of clothing. One should always understand the effects of anything in which one is clothed.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11970": "And remember – now is not the time to ease off your studying. O.W.L.s will be here before you know it.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11971": "Have a seat.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11973": "But perhaps it was his remarkable courage for which we will all be forever indebted to him. If not for Professor Fig -",
  "MatildaWeasley_11974": "Well, I can say with confidence that if not for him, many of us – let alone Hogwarts – would not be here today.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11975": "Those that knew him best – ",
  "MatildaWeasley_11976": "– will agree that we must now honour him as only Hogwarts can – by wisely,  resourcefully,  justly,  and bravely facing all that lies ahead.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11979": "Ah. Good timing.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11988": "Exploring ruins? Well. I presume Professor Fig has his reasons for keeping the details to himself for now.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11989": "Hmm. Almost precisely what Professor Fig said.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11990": "Speak of the devil.",
  "MatildaWeasley_11994": "Now that you've attended Beasts class, I've asked Deek to assist you in using the Room to further your studies in that regard.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12018": "Very good. When conjuring more complex objects, you’ll need what’s called a spellcraft.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12019": "Spellcrafts are like recipes: they list the 'ingredients' – or resources – needed to conjure a particular object.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12020": "While resources, such as moonstone, can be obtained throughout the Highlands, it's much safer and easier to purchase them.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12022": "You should have acquired some for a potions station and potting table from Tomes and Scrolls in Hogsmeade.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12024": "Why don’t you give it a try? Go ahead and conjure the potions station and potting table.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12025": "But, the Room of Requirement has its own rules.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12027": "Ah! And, it seems the Room has provided you with a Desk of Description. Excellent.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12032": "Perhaps Sebastian Sallow or Natsai Onai? I've noticed you spending time with them.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12034": "When you have a moment, please stop by the Room of Requirement. Deek tells me he has something to share with you.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12036": "Professor Fig represented the best of all of us. He could be deviously clever. Possessed a brilliantly inquisitive mind, and - was the most loyal of friends.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12069": "I suggest you practise the wand movements first, then you can clear the chairs away.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12076": "Quite an entrance. It's lovely to meet you. I'm –",
  "MatildaWeasley_12077": "As I was saying – I'm Professor Weasley. Pleased to meet you.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12080": "I shall see to it, sir.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12081": "It's most uncommon for a student to begin as a fifth-year. This should be quite an adventure.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12082": "Never could remember the password when I was a girl, however.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12083": "Well done.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12084": "Now, go on in and get some sleep – you have a big day ahead of you tomorrow.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12085": "This is the entrance to the Ravenclaw common room. You must solve a riddle to enter.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12086": "I won't be of much help, I'm afraid. This sort of thing has always confounded me.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12087": "Now, go on in and get some sleep. You have a big day ahead of you tomorrow.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12088": "Now, here we are at the entrance to the Hufflepuff common room.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12089": "Indeed. I will explain what to do, but I hesitate to do it myself as one errant knock leads to being doused in vinegar. Most unpleasant.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12090": "Well done. Now, go on in and get some sleep. You have a big day ahead of you tomorrow.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12091": "I suspected as much. This is the entrance to the Slytherin common room.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12092": "Well done.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12093": "Now, go on in and get some sleep. You have a big day ahead of you tomorrow.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12094": "Very well. First, you'll need to gather some moonstone.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12095": "You can acquire it by vanishing items here in the Room of Requirement or you can gather it – carefully – outside of the Hogwarts grounds.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12096": "Return to me once you've gathered enough and we shall begin the lesson.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12097": "Good. Then we may begin your lesson.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12099": "Yes?",
  "MatildaWeasley_12100": "I will say that a simple addition such as a wall hanging or a portrait might make the space feel unique.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12101": "Indeed you can. You already know the spell – <i>Evanesco</i>.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12102": "When you vanish something, the moonstone used to conjure it will become available to you again.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12103": "I look forward to seeing your work.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12108": "Yes?",
  "MatildaWeasley_12110": "Your space might benefit from a bit of ambiance, don't you think?",
  "MatildaWeasley_12111": "Quite a difference.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12112": "Of course, you needn't keep this style if you don't like it. You can always ask Deek to change it back.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12113": "Now, you have learnt a good bit about Alteration.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12114": "Indeed. No matter how much time I spend here, the Room always manages to surprise me.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12115": "An even bigger space.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12116": "The room equips itself to your needs. It must have sensed that you needed more space to practise spell-casting.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12118": "If you'd like to customise the space further, you can use these spellcrafts. You'll find more of them both inside and outside the school.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12124": "Good. I'll leave you to it. This is your space now. Use it wisely.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12126": "You can conjure more than Potions and Herbology tables.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12127": "Conjuration can be used to decorate this space to your liking.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12128": "Why don't you try it on the walls and floor?",
  "MatildaWeasley_12129": "I shall leave that entirely up to you. This is your space, after all.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12130": "I think you're ready to take on Alteration.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12131": "The Altering spell will allow you to customise any conjured item.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12132": "Let's get started, shall we? Watch closely as I demonstrate how to perform the Altering spell.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12133": "You can change the colours, patterns, and styles of your furniture to suit your taste.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12134": "Just aim your wand at any conjured item and perform the Altering spell to customise it.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12136": "Simply aim your wand at a conjured item that you would like to customise and cast the Altering spell as I showed you.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12137": "You can change an item's appearance in a number of ways as well as move the item around the Room.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12138": "Alteration allows you to change the appearance of items you've conjured.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12139": "You can change colour, pattern, or style.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12140": "I'll be here if you need anything else.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12141": "Nicely done.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12142": "Now you're ready for something a little more advanced.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12143": "You can use the Altering spell directly on the Room's architecture.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12144": "Try these new designs on the floor or balcony.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12145": "Deek? Would you mind?",
  "MatildaWeasley_12149": "I'm here if you do.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12150": "You've given yourself quite a canvas to work with.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12151": "I've more to teach you about Transfiguration – if you have a moment.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12152": "Do you have the moonstone? You can acquire some by vanishing items here in the Room or you can gather it outside the Hogwarts grounds.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12153": "Try aiming at the floor or at that balcony whilst using the Altering spell.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12154": "I taught Deek a little magic some years ago that could help here. Why don't you ask him about it when he returns?",
  "MatildaWeasley_12156": "In that regard, I've asked your professors to help hasten your progress with some extra assignments.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12158": "Now, regarding the trip to Hogsmeade I mentioned earlier.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12159": "Always something happening here. It's the heart of the hive. Our 'King's Cross station,' so to speak.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12161": "No time to waste. You've classes to attend.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12163": "A lot to absorb on your first day. And you have much to learn.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12164": "He's been terribly vague as to the events preceding your arrival – specifically, about what happened after that awful dragon attack.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12165": "My suspicion is that there's more to the story than a search for belongings and an extended trip up to the castle.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12166": "Perfect opportunity to show you how to use Floo Flames to get around a bit quicker.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12173": "Indeed it is.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12174": "Please meet him there when you can.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12176": "Deek tells me he shared with you his experience with the phoenix. Please check in with him when you get the chance. He has an idea for you that I thought worth exploring.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12190": "You've managed your classes well with a borrowed wand. But you'll find the magic you cast with your own wand to be far superior.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12191": "We've arranged to replace the supplies lost on your way here – including seeds, potion recipes and spellcrafts.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12192": "Seems Professor Fig taught you quite a bit during your brief detour near – what was it you said? 'Some ruins?'",
  "MatildaWeasley_12193": "Seems Professor Fig taught you quite a bit before you arrived.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12194": "I heard as much from Professors Hecat and Ronen.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12208": "And I believe it every year. I'm most often correct.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12211": "You've no business being in the Faculty Tower.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12212": "What is the point of rules if you are insistent on breaking them?",
  "MatildaWeasley_12213": "Is someone there?",
  "MatildaWeasley_12214": "Any students in the Faculty Tower will make themselves known immediately.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12215": "Glad to see no student was foolish enough to sneak into the Faculty Tower.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12216": "Happy to see students are following the rules.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12217": "Simply cast <i>Revelio</i> on it and we'll see what the Guide says.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12219": "You can cast <i>Evanesco</i> to vanish certain objects, such as these chairs and other things here in the Room.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12220": "Now, I'll give you a brief lesson in Conjuring. The Room might not provide everything you need on its own.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12221": "Presuming, of course, you've collected any seeds or potion ingredients you need in Hogsmeade or outside the castle grounds.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12222": "Judging by your adept use of <i>Revelio</i> earlier, I'd say Professor Fig succeeded in at least showing you the basics.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12223": "That should be all for now. You'll be expected to attend both Charms and Defence Against the Dark Arts classes today.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12224": "And I'd like to be sure you get to Hogsmeade as soon as possible to replace the supplies you lost on the way here.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12225": "Fortunately, we are lucky to have the ever-gifted Professor Hecat in charge of our students' education in that regard.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12226": "Exactly what you might expect. Spells, charms, jinxes. All terribly useful.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12227": "Defence Against the Dark Arts, as the name implies, focuses on how to defend oneself against the evils that lurk beyond these walls.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12228": "I think you will enjoy Professor Ronen. He's a clever and entertaining wizard – and a talented teacher.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12229": "A mastery of Defence Against the Dark Arts is required for those who aspire to become Aurors.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12230": "You should be able to find all of the school supplies you require in Hogsmeade.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12231": "Hogsmeade is the only all-wizarding village in Britain – and is home to an array of shops and pubs.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12232": "You will also, I imagine, enjoy many a Butterbeer there with friends in due course.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12233": "Happily, your professors have agreed to create additional assignments for you outside of class. You'll be up to speed in no time.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12234": "Professor Fig. Your ears must have been burning.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12235": "Yes. You seem to have provided our new fifth-year with a solid foundation in the basics of spell-casting.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12236": "Hmm. Well, I'm just glad you both arrived in one piece.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12237": "Perfectly good boats and carriages to Hogwarts and you chose to fly in the path of a dragon.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12238": "Very well. Enough chit-chat. I need to get to class myself.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12239": "Thank you.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12240": "Might I rely on you, Professor Fig, to explain the details of the Field Guide's map?",
  "MatildaWeasley_12243": "Good luck today.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12244": "And remember to use your Field Guide. It will be invaluable to you.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12245": "And, invaluable to me as I'll be using it to keep up to date on your progress.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12246": "Come and find me in my classroom after you've attended both classes today, and I'll explain more about those assignments I mentioned.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12247": "And we'll see if we can't get you to Hogsmeade for those supplies.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12248": "Why don't you cast <i>Revelio</i> on this bust and see what details the Field Guide can provide?",
  "MatildaWeasley_12249": "Why don't you cast <i>Revelio</i> on that statue and see what details the Field Guide can provide?",
  "MatildaWeasley_12250": "Why don't you cast <i>Revelio</i> on this portrait and see what details the Field Guide provides?",
  "MatildaWeasley_12251": "He continues to be reticent about the details – mentioning only a few spells. <i>Revelio</i>, was it? And <i>Lumos</i>?",
  "MatildaWeasley_12252": "Very well. I'd like you to make your first visit to the village with a classmate. Help you get your bearings.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12253": "A spellcraft is a recipe of sorts used when conjuring objects.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12254": "I shall explain more about them when you begin working with Transfiguration magic.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12255": "There is. Most people are familiar with the shop in Diagon Alley. We're fortunate to have someone like him nearby.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12256": "I would trust no one else to pair me with a wand.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12257": "He'll keep you well clear of any of Victor Rookwood's undesirables en route.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12258": "In fact, Professor Ronen will meet you outside momentarily to assign your first one.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12259": "You shall find the time. You'd be astonished to know just how much you don't know.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12260": "No time to waste. The sooner you complete your work, the sooner you can enjoy a Butterbeer at the Three Broomsticks.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12261": "You'll note that you are now in possession of moonstone. We shall discuss its uses later. Let's move on.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12262": "I'd suggest you see how it works.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12264": "Good luck. I shall linger a bit longer in case you'd like to learn another Transfiguration spell for use in the Room.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12265": "Deek has had a good deal of experience – both here at Hogwarts and at a previous post.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12266": "I shall let Deek tell you more when he's ready. But, again, you would be wise to listen to any suggestions he may have.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12267": "Conjuring and Vanishing are strictly forbidden elsewhere in the castle. We've charms in place to enforce that.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12268": "It would be exhausting to reverse the errors in both judgement and magic.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12269": "They can also be collected by vanishing objects in the Room, such as the chairs you vanished earlier. In fact, you should have enough resources for now.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12270": "You can indeed. Quite perceptive.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12271": "You should find both familiar since they'll resemble the ones you've already used, to study magical plants and brew potions in class.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12272": "It's time you learned the Transformation spell. After you've completed the required tasks – which I'm certain will prove useful in finishing your Field Guide – attend my class to learn the new spell. Afterwards, we will discuss your progress thus far in the term.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12273": "Glad to see you were paying close attention to my demonstration of the Transformation spell.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12275": "I did. You seem to have had no trouble in getting up to speed –",
  "MatildaWeasley_12276": "– and, frankly, excelling in your schoolwork this year.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12284": "It'll be the end of the year in no time and you'll want to be well-prepared for your O.W.L.s.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12285": "I'll provide a final assessment at that time to ensure that you're ready for your exams.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12286": "Until then – well done. You are dismissed.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12291": "Now, it seems you've been making excellent use of the opportunities presented by your Field Guide.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12292": "Now, it seems you've been making good use of the opportunities presented by your Field Guide.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12293": "Now, it seems you haven't been taking full advantage of the opportunities presented by your Field Guide. I'd advise you not to squander such a resource.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12294": "Of course, the Guide isn't the only measure of success.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12295": "Deek tells me you captured a unicorn and brought it back to the Room of Requirement.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12296": "I've heard that you were able to grow a Venomous Tentacula.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12297": "I've heard that you can brew an impressive Edurus Potion.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12298": "Growing such a magical plant is an accomplishment of which you can be quite proud.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12299": "Protecting so rare a beast is an accomplishment of which you can be quite proud.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12300": "Hopefully you won't need it any time soon, but it is a valuable potion to have when it is needed.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12301": "If you wish to practise the spell you just learned, the training dummy is available.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12302": "Yes. The Transformation spell.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12303": "But first I'd like you to carry out a couple of tasks, which will help you to complete your Field Guide.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12304": "Attend my Transfiguration class once you've done them and we can begin the lesson.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12305": "This is the 'Room of Requirement.' It only appears when one is in real need of it.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12306": "I'd only planned to suggest to you how to find it – by walking past that bit of wall focusing on what you need.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12307": "But you've managed to reveal the room on your own. While I'm here, we should take advantage of the moment.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12308": "Ordinarily, a student might stumble upon this room entirely by accident – if ever.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12309": "The house-elf I was speaking to in my classroom your first day.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12310": "Thought he might help you use the Room once you found it.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12312": "Mr Ollivander is a genuine craftsman and highly skilled wandmaker.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12313": "I see. Like trying to get a sonnet from a Streeler.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12314": "I'd wager there's a good deal more to your travels here than what you've told me – isn't there?",
  "MatildaWeasley_12315": "It will. I hope you'll take advantage of it.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12322": "As I suspected they would be.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12323": "And I'm certain you would not have been as successful without them.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12351": "Sir?",
  "MatildaWeasley_12352": "Oh. Very well.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12353": "Leeway, Professor? Are you sure that's wise? I confess I do worry for his students. He's rarely here as it is.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12354": "I see. But sir, if I may, I am wary of how much time the new fifth-year seems to be spending away from the castle – supposedly on Professor Fig's behalf.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12355": "I – well – I – uhm – thank you. But I am happy to look into – ",
  "MatildaWeasley_12359": "I've heard unsettling rumours of their escapades. Everything from sneaking into the Forbidden Forest –",
  "MatildaWeasley_12360": "– to confronting Ranrok's Loyalists and Rookwood's lot.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12361": "I will say, I'm especially impressed with all you've accomplished – in light of the rumours of your extracurricular activities.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12362": "Was your visit to the kitchens – and the Hogsmeade graveyard with Nick to bribe a ghost for information – connected in any way to Professor Fig?",
  "MatildaWeasley_12363": "Was your visit to an ex-Auror in Upper Hogsfield connected in any way to Professor Fig? I can't begin to imagine what that was about.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12364": "Was your extended conversation with Mr Ollivander after you'd obtained your wand, or subsequent search of the Owlery, connected in any way to Professor Fig?",
  "MatildaWeasley_12365": "Were your meetings with Professor Black's house-elf and exploration of various caves down by the lake connected in any way to Professor Fig?",
  "MatildaWeasley_12366": "I see. I admire your penchant for learning. But do remember that your classwork and Field Guide are designed to educate you thoroughly.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12367": "Well, it would seem that it certainly merits, I'd say, 100 points to their house? – wouldn't you agree?",
  "MatildaWeasley_12377": "You've had quite a year – both inside and outside of Hogwarts.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12378": "I've heard all sorts of rumours – you've ridden a Graphorn, befriended a goblin, rescued Hippogriffs –",
  "MatildaWeasley_12379": "– even somehow ingratiated yourself with the Headless Hunt.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12380": "– even helped Mr Ollivander track down a family wand.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12381": "– even took it upon yourself to help Professor Black's house-elf.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12382": "– and I don't even want to know the truth behind the rumours that you visited Azkaban.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12383": "I'm just glad you found such a good friend in Miss Onai. I think her mother shares the sentiment.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12384": "I'm just glad you found such a good friend in Miss Sweeting. It's nice to see her engaging more with her classmates.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12385": "I'm just glad you found such a good friend in Mr Sallow. I believe it's been a difficult year for him.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12386": "While I do not condone taking matters into your own hands when it comes to men like Rookwood and Harlow, your bravery is to be commended.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12387": "There have evidently been Snidget sightings in the area lately. If the centaurs are to be believed, two Hogwarts students are behind it.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12388": "He was lucky to have you.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12389": "No need to discuss it further. What I would like to discuss is your Wizard's Field Guide.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12390": "Fortunately, you do have some time to prepare for your O.W.L.s.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12391": "With your O.W.L.s soon upon us, I am thrilled to see you so prepared.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12393": "It's harder to keep secrets around here than one might suspect.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12394": "May I see it?",
  "MatildaWeasley_12395": "I think you've been busy this year.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12396": "It seems you've nothing left to do to complete your Field Guide! Most impressive!",
  "MatildaWeasley_12397": "It seems you've nearly completed your Field Guide. Well done, indeed!",
  "MatildaWeasley_12398": "It seems you've completed much of your Field Guide. Well done. But you've still a little left to do.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12399": "I see some progress here, but quite a bit of your Field Guide has yet to be completed.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12400": "I will confess, I had a sense about you from that first moment you came bursting in, late, to the Sorting Ceremony.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12401": "I am pleased to see that my instincts were correct.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12402": "To think, you've only been with us a year and you'll already be taking your O.W.L.s – well, it's nothing short of astonishing.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12403": "You are most welcome. I look forward to seeing what you do during the rest of your time with us.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12404": "No need to discuss it further. What I would like to discuss is your Wizard's Field Guide.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12405": "When you have a moment, please stop by the Room of Requirement. Deek mentioned you might be interested in learning how to breed beasts.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12407": "You seem to have forgotten something.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12408": "Oh, Eleazar – if you'd have only come to me sooner –",
  "MatildaWeasley_12409": "I do hope you're all right after what happened in Hogsmeade.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12410": "Best we can do is learn from the siege and never let it happen again.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12411": "So pleased you've completed your field guide. Well done!",
  "MatildaWeasley_12412": "Miss Onai is a wonderful companion, I'm sure.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12413": "Poppy is fortunate to have a friend like you.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12414": "Sebastian appears quite in need of a friend.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12415": "Amit is a wonderful choice of friend.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12416": "Imelda, eh? Would've never picked the two of you as friends.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12417": "Mind not to let Mister Clopton influence you too much, eh?",
  "MatildaWeasley_12418": "I caution against the use of Dark Magic.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12420": "By all accounts, Hogwarts would be lost without you.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12421": "You've been practising.",
  "MatildaWeasley_12422": "Best watch yourself.",

  "MidResFemaleA_10895": "Is there a person riding that Graphorn?",
  "MidResFemaleA_10896": "Seems a bit frightening, riding a Hippogriff. I don't know if I could do it.",

  "MidResFemaleA_10898": "You're the one who saved young Archie Bickle, aren't you?",
  "MidResFemaleA_10899": "There's a rumour going round that you freed a Hippogriff from poachers. That true?",
  "MidResFemaleA_10900": "I can't believe you rescued Isko Rabe! It's amazing!",
  "MidResFemaleA_10901": "You showed that vile Rookwood!",
  "MidResFemaleA_10903": "Rumour has it, Sebastian Sallow got detention for you. I can't believe he'd do that.",
  "MidResFemaleA_10904": "It's very sad Anne Sallow can't come to Hogwarts this year. I quite liked her.",
  "MidResFemaleA_10922": "Um – shouldn't you be in your robes? It's not time for bed.",
  "MidResFemaleA_10923": "I couldn't believe it when you beat Imelda! The best flier in school actually lost a race!",
  "MidResFemaleA_10944": "Why in the world do I always see you with Professor Fig? I'd stay far away from that man if it was me.",
  "MidResFemaleA_10945": "It's a shame about Professor Fig. I didn't really know him myself, but still – I'm very sorry.",
  "MidResFemaleA_10948": "You were there, when the goblins attacked Hogwarts, yes? Whatever was it like?",
  "MidResFemaleA_10955": "(celebratory cheers)",
  "MidResFemaleA_10959": "We'll see how you like it.",
  "MidResFemaleA_10960": "A little room, everyone. Let them through.",
  "MidResFemaleA_10961": "Lenora Everleigh's acting a bit potty. Talking to an empty frame?",
  "MidResFemaleA_10974": "Nellie, please get down. A professor could arrive any moment.",
  "MidResFemaleA_10975": "I don't want to get in trouble the first day.",
  "MidResFemaleA_10994": "There really was something to those treasure maps Arthur's been going on about after all.",
  "MidResFemaleA_10995": "Nellieeeeeeeeeeeee.",
  "MidResFemaleA_10996": "If you get caught, I shan't defend you!",
  "MidResFemaleA_10997": "Checkmate.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11000": "Give 'em what for!",
  "MidResFemaleA_11001": "I shall never get my homework done at this rate. I haven't even got to Beasts.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11002": "I wish I could simply charm my exercise books to finish my homework for me.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11003": "I tried telling Hecat that someone cast <i>Evanesco</i> on my assignment. She said if I didn't get it sorted, I'd be the one getting vanished.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11004": "She's always showing off about her Puffskein grooming; 'Fur like silk. What shine. ' I could be sick.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11005": "People who boast are insecure. That's what my mother told me, and she knows everything. At least that's what she told me.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11006": "If I'm honest I wish I had something to boast about. But I'm hopeless at everything. Oh! I suppose that's something to boast about?",
  "MidResFemaleA_11007": "But it's always so noisy in the common room. And then I can't concentrate so I end up just talking to everyone and nothing gets done.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11008": "Ugh. Don't get the password wrong's all I can say.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11009": "I'd much prefer it if everyone could simply use all of the common rooms. I'm not a fan of mine and frankly I find the décor quite depressing.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11010": "She put a Bowtruckle under my bed and I know it was her. She's looking for trouble, that one. Looking for it.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11011": "I couldn't agree more.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11012": "Well, I woke up to one. Wriggling its foul little tongue up my nose it was.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11013": "There's not one week gone by I haven't had a howler from my mother. She's doing it deliberately. It's because I left my room in a mess.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11014": "My mother sends the foulest owls. I'm talking about the actual owls.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11015": "I can't help it if I was having a nightmare. Serves them right for talking about Lethifolds right before bed.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11016": "My sister's always wanting quills made of Fwooper feathers. She's always after the latest fad. I've told her, a nib's a nib.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11017": "They say Herbology is the study of magical and mundane plants.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11018": "Don't you find it chilly in the greenhouses? It always surprises me how cool it is.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11019": "Makes no sense to me why first-years don't study Abyssinian Shrivelfigs. Why should they escape the torment.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11020": "I should've known better than to buy something from a child walking the streets of Hogsmeade. Little scallywag. 'Gold', they said it was. More like the work of a leprechaun; stuff disappeared in a few hours. I'm such a moonmind.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11021": "I always feel quite safe in Hogsmeade. It's your own fault if you come unstuck, that's what my mother would say. And certainly keep away from the Hog's Head. Most untoward.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11022": "Professor Howin was carrying some Pearl Dust the other day. Obviously, I asked her if it was for a love potion. Her face just contorted. You'd think I'd just beat her at Gobstones.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11023": "I'd rather Howin be teaching Potions than Sharp. I don't like how often he mentions 'common poisons'. It's like he's planning something. What? It's not implausible.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11024": "If you pay attention, Sharp has plenty of useful advice regarding antidotes. I think people are too hard on him myself.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11025": "I wish teachers wouldn't ask us questions in class. I'm always tongue-tied. Unless it's Professor Garlick. Or I suppose Weasley, or Onai. Thinking about it, it's really just Sharp.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11026": "I can't help it if I've never encountered a dangerous beast. When Howin asked me, I said I once had a canary. She almost threw me out of class.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11027": "I saw a first-year get the rhythm wrong once trying to get to the Hufflepuff common room; you've never seen so much laughter.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11030": "(disappointed groans)",
  "MidResFemaleA_11031": "There are specific rules about bringing beasts into the dormitory and she should be expelled for it.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11032": "What's she going to bring in next? Trolls?",
  "MidResFemaleA_11033": "Every one of them looks as if it's about to take a death drop into the porridge.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11034": "Ugh, she does fuss.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11035": "I can tell you with full assurance that there isn't one plant that is not mundane.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11036": "Surprised the Mandrakes don't make more of a fuss.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11037": "You're not supposed to be flying here!",
  "MidResFemaleA_11043": "You do not belong here.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11044": "You're clearly up to no good.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11045": "No prowlers creeping around here.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11046": "No untoward visitors skulking about here.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11047": "The Headmaster would never allow a student in here – other than a prefect, of course.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11048": "On my authority as a prefect I command any unauthorised students to present themselves.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11050": "I spent all night working on my History of Magic essay. Almost fell asleep in class today. Though I suppose that's normal in History of Magic.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11051": "Just when I think I'm finished with my schoolwork, I remember another assignment. If it’s not twelve inches of parchment for Potions it’s twenty inches for Charms.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11052": "I can't wait to have a nap in front of the fire in the common room later. After Sharp's last class, I've earned it.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11053": "Made the mistake of leaving my Potions homework in the common room. I'm convinced Peeves absconded with it.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11054": "I'm convinced I'm the only one in my dormitory who doesn't snore. I shall need a Sleeping Draught to get a good night's sleep if it keeps up.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11055": "A girl in our dormitory keeps getting packages of homemade pasties from her family. We shan't fit into our robes for next term at this rate.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11056": "Professor Sharp asked me what the ingredients are for an Alihotsy Draught and I could not stop giggling. Most embarrassing. And appropriate I suppose.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11057": "I'm convinced that Binns called on me in class the other day just to embarrass me! How am I supposed to know what year the Floo Network was invented?",
  "MidResFemaleA_11058": "Chinese Chomping Cabbages terrify me. Something about a leafy vegetable with teeth seems extremely unnatural.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11059": "Don't get me started on how horrifying Venomous Tentacula are. Why we're forced to engage with them in class instead of just reading about them is beyond me.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11060": "To be honest, anything I could get in Diagon Alley this year I was able to find in Hogsmeade.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11061": "I only speak up in classes where the teacher doesn’t deduct house points for wrong answers. To be fair, I don't say much.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11062": "Wonder how well our professors did when they were students. Can't all have been top of their class, can they? Gives me some hope to think of, at least.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11064": "My sister’ll be home for the holidays this year. Hope she's bought me a new Beater’s bat – we’re bound to have Quidditch next year.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11065": "My family loves going to the Quidditch World Cup. Father was on the Barnton amateur team for a bit – been obsessed with the sport ever since.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11066": "I wonder how many secret passages Hogwarts actually has. I stumbled on one the other day; couldn’t find my way out for hours. Missed my favourite meal, I did – kidney pie.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11067": "Where do the professors sleep? Surely they don’t share a common room like the students – do they?",
  "MidResFemaleA_11068": "I'd wager Ravenclaw Tower has some of the best views in the castle. Someone saw a Hippogriff fly right past the window once.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11069": "I have family in Irondale. Father wants me to visit them. But I haven't had the time. Or the inclination.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11070": "Life is so peaceful in the hamlets. Well, when goblins aren’t lurking around every corner. Can't be good for business.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11071": "I adore shopping in Hogsmeade after it's snowed. It's so – what’s the word? – magical.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11072": "Madam Kogawa's certainly strict. I thought flying was supposed to be fun.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11073": "I used to enjoy flying, but there are so many rules now.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11074": "Can't wait till I'm old enough to Apparate. No more falling off brooms for me.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11075": "Imelda Reyes acts as if she invented Quidditch. I don’t think she's even that good at it.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11076": "The only reason I'd want to play Quidditch is to wear those uniforms. So fashionable.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11077": "Black only looks out for the pure-bloods. He couldn't care less about the rest of us.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11078": "Black is without a doubt the worst Headmaster in the history of Hogwarts. He's not behind me, is he?",
  "MidResFemaleA_11079": "I don't think a single student likes Professor Black. They may pretend to like him, but they don’t.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11080": "I adore getting owls from back home. My father sends me one almost every week.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11081": "My mother always responds to my owls very swiftly.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11082": "It's always so exciting to see the owls come swooping into the Great Hall.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11083": "How many owls do you think Hogwarts has?",
  "MidResFemaleA_11084": "I think Transfiguration is the hardest subject. It requires such precision and concentration. One wrong move and you’ve got a grouse instead of a mouse.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11085": "I don't understand why people go on about Vanishment being difficult. It's only one incantation: <i>Evanesco</i>. There. That's it.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11086": "The food that appears in the Great Hall isn't conjured; the house-elves make it.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11087": "I thought Potions required precision, but Transfiguration makes Potions seem easy. Quite puts it to shame if you ask me.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11088": "That sounded suspicious.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11089": "Is someone sneaking about?",
  "MidResFemaleA_11090": "Caught you.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11091": "You should have known better than to cross my path.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11092": "It was nothing after all.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11093": "Must be the night air playing tricks.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11094": "People like her and Garreth Weasley are the reason we have new spells and potions. You should be thanking her.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11103": "Reckon they have a nice view from up there.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11104": "I hope they know what they're doing on that thing.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11105": "I simply adore watching Hippogriffs in flight.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11106": "Looks like somebody's ready for bed.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11107": "How is it that Professor Fig always seems to be away?",
  "MidResFemaleA_11108": "I keep hoping that Professor Fig isn't dead after all; that somehow he managed to survive.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11109": "I knew there'd be a troll attack! Saw it in my tea leaves and would anybody listen?",
  "MidResFemaleA_11110": "Any of Ranrok's Loyalists that are left should be thrown straight into Azkaban.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11111": "Brilliant work, beating everyone at Crossed Wands!",
  "MidResFemaleA_11112": "You really put Imelda in her place. Well done!",
  "MidResFemaleA_11113": "Incredible job at Summoner's Court! I really enjoyed seeing that.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11114": "Strange to see you without Natty. Nice to see she found a friend – hopefully her mother approves.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11115": "I see you and Poppy are always together. You must like beasts. Or Poppy, I suppose.",
  "MidResFemaleA_11116": "You and Sebastian are quite the twosome these days. Hopefully you're cheering him up a bit.",

  "MidResFemaleB_10994": "Garlick asked me to explain to the class the main use of plants. I said picking them. What?",
  "MidResFemaleB_10995": "Obviously the best greenhouse is the one with the dangerous plants.",
  "MidResFemaleB_10996": "I think <i>Diffindo</i> should be taught in the first year. Why stave off the mayhem?",
  "MidResFemaleB_10997": "We're quite fortunate the school's so close to Hogsmeade. There's nothing like it in all of Britain, you know. About the only place that doesn't come with the risk of encountering a Muggle.",
  "MidResFemaleB_10998": "If I had to pick one shop, it'd be Gladrags. Mr Hill is always very helpful, don't you find?",
  "MidResFemaleB_10999": "Do you happen to have any valerian sprigs? I really wanted to have a go at a Forgetfulness Potion, only I can't remember where I put mine.",

  "MidResFemaleB_11002": "I don't know about Demiguises, but Howin had me on hot bricks the other day. Telling us about her colleague who befriended a Griffin. I put my hand up and said we had a Griffin come by our street once and try to get our rabbit. My sister had to run out after it, throwing stones till it flew off. I thought Howin'd be impressed but, oh, the glare! She said, 'You never meddle with dangerous beasts.' If you ask me, she's the dangerous beast.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11003": "It's awful if you're sat near someone and they're trying to pass notes about. Half the time I get the blame, and Hecat has no tolerance for that, I can tell you.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11004": "Apparently Sharp made quite an example of her.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11005": " I could be locking all you scallywags up in Azkaban one day.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11006": "Apparently, they just kept repeating words to a naughty song Peeves wrote. Best thing Peeves has ever done.",

  "MidResFemaleB_11011": "Who wants to learn about Bubotuber pus? That's a serious question.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11012": "Herbology's much more fun when there's untoward spells on the loose.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11021": "What was that?",
  "MidResFemaleB_11022": "I think I heard something.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11023": "Thought you could sneak past me, eh? I've caught you.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11024": "No high marks in discretion for you. Move along.",

  "MidResFemaleB_11028": "A prefect's job is never done.",

  "MidResFemaleB_11030": "I've studying to do. No time for these shenanigans.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11031": "A student in the Faculty Tower would be most improper.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11032": "You can't outwit a prefect.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11034": "What a duel.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11035": "Forgot to read the chapter for Potions today. Wish I had a potion to remind myself to do my homework.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11036": "Professor Sharp terrifies me. He glanced sideways at me last week and I almost dropped an entire Flobberworm into my cauldron.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11037": "I prefer to study in the library. It's always much too loud in the common room.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11038": "I'd wager the Hufflepuff common room's the cosiest of them all. Simply the fact that it's so close to the kitchens makes it seem more homely.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11039": "The other girls and I were up all night reading letters from my secret admirer. They're very jealous of me. I'm sure.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11040": "I thought it would be hard adjusting to sharing a room, but I rather enjoy the company.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11041": "Natty doesn't seem to mind having her mother as a teacher at all. I'd hide in my common room if it were me.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11042": "Poor Susan and those second-hand robes. Looks like her grandmother in them. Smells like her too.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11043": "No better feeling than plunging your hands into greenhouse soil. Unless you accidentally uproot a baby Mandrake.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11044": "I mistook a Snargaluff pod for a Puffapod the other day in Herbology. Won't be making that mistake any time soon.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11045": "My friends and I lose track of the time whenever we're at the Three Broomsticks. Nearly missed exams one year we were so engrossed in our Butterbeers.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11046": "Can't decide if I like Professor Weasley or Professor Hecat more. Hecat. No, Weasley. Ugh. They're both brilliant.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11047": "Some think Professor Shah is hard to read, but I find her as easy to read as a star chart. She has no patience for time-wasting.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11048": "I do look forward to going home for the holidays. Mum’s pumpkin pasties are the best I’ve ever had.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11049": "Nothing better than a few pints of Butterbeer and a pile of mince pies with my sisters on Christmas Eve.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11050": "My brothers and I prefer Pumpkin Juice with our mince pies. My aunt introduced us to those years ago.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11051": "Hogwarts always has another mystery to discover. If I don't find a way to concentrate, I'll fail my O.W.L.s for certain.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11052": "My favourite room in the school is the library. It always smells of fresh parchment.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11053": "I haven't been down to the boathouse since arriving my first year. Perhaps I'll pay a visit.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11054": "Patrick Redding is surprisingly sombre considering he runs a shop as fun as Honeydukes.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11055": "Have you visited any of the hamlets outside of Hogsmeade? Some nice shops to be found.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11056": "I hear Upper Hogsfield is lovely. Or was it Lower Hogsfield? Well, both Hogsfields.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11057": "No better feeling than the wind in your hair as you fly above the world on a broom.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11058": "My sister organised Quidditch practice all summer to prepare for this year. She was most upset when it was all cancelled.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11059": "I wish I was an Animagus that could fly – a raven or an owl. Then I wouldn't need my own broom.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11060": "I think I'd have made an excellent Seeker. I have a sharp eye. Can spot the shadow of a Demiguise in the snow.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11061": "I hope I'm wealthy enough one day to buy every broom model at Spintwitches.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11062": "I thought Professor Black would get rid of all the Muggle-born students. Too much to hope for, I suppose.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11063": "I'm glad there's a Slytherin in charge of the school. Willing to make the hard decisions.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11064": "Power should be kept in the oldest pure-blood families, like the Blacks. Wouldn't want riff-raff running things. That's what my mother says.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11065": "I wish I received letters from home more often. I like knowing what my sisters are up to. The youngest is learning to de-gnome the garden.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11066": "I can't wait till all my sisters are at Hogwarts with me. Their turn to send the owls home.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11067": "I do get nervous when the owls fly into the Great Hall. One's bound to crash into me eventually. Yes it is.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11068": "Hogwarts must have hundreds of owls in the owlery. Wonder there's any mice left.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11069": "I wish I was a Metamorphmagus. Imagine being able to change your eye colour depending upon your mood.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11070": "I'd hate Transfiguration if it wasn't for Weasley. She definitely takes the fear out of it, and that's saying something.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11071": "I should think there's an entire ward in St Mungo's for Transfiguration accidents.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11072": "I love Switching Spells. Swapped my brother's treacle tart for a fish pie once. He still won't eat around me.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11073": "Why are you helping Zenobia? You don't enjoy that wretched game, do you?",
  "MidResFemaleB_11080": "She’s been the top racer for too long.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11082": "Goodness! Look how fast they're going!",
  "MidResFemaleB_11084": "A Hippogriff? I'm jealous.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11088": "That what we're wearing today?",
  "MidResFemaleB_11089": "Never quite sure about Professor Fig.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11090": "I can't believe he's gone.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11091": "I don't feel safe going to Hogsmeade anymore.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11093": "I don't feel safe anymore. Not with Ranrok's siege.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11094": "You won every single battle at Crossed Wands? Brilliant.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11095": "I'd wager Imelda's ego's feeling a bit deflated now.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11096": "Held your own on Summoner's Court.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11097": "You and Natty seem inseparable these days.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11098": "I think you're the first two-legged friend Poppy's had.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11099": "You and Sebastian seem to be true friends. He's needed one since Anne left.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11100": "Glad someone finds Amit's conversations interesting.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11101": "Seems you and Imelda have become fast friends.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11102": "Surprised you spend so much time with Everett.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11103": "Half of Hogsmeade might've been destroyed if not for you.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11104": "Knew it was too good to be true – Pratt's back.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11105": "Someone's moved Ferdinand to the Hog's Head.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11106": "Oh, thank Merlin the Three Broomsticks is finally free of Ferdinand Octavius Pratt.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11107": "Argh! What's this about?",
  "MidResFemaleB_11108": "Why are you trying to get in there?",
  "MidResFemaleB_11110": "Don't know where we'd all be without you.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11111": "Well done besting Sebastian at duelling.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11112": "Looks as if Poppy's finally made a friend.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11113": "Watch yourself!",
  "MidResFemaleB_11114": "So nice to have the bells ringing again.",
  "MidResFemaleB_11115": "Pardon you.",

  "MidResFemaleC_10151": "It's you! Now that's a good surprise.",

  "MidResFemaleC_10154": "Hello.",
  "MidResFemaleC_10155": "Hope you're well.",
  "MidResFemaleC_10156": "Taking care of yourself, I hope!",
  "MidResFemaleC_10157": "Hope all is well.",
  "MidResFemaleC_10158": "School treating you well, I hope.",
  "MidResFemaleC_10710": "Whose bright idea was it to have a poltergeist in a school?",
  "MidResFemaleC_10711": "Ridiculous. Truly.",
  "MidResFemaleC_10712": "He's out of control.",
  "MidResFemaleC_10729": "It's not every day I get an audience.",
  "MidResFemaleC_10730": "Shall I try to go a little faster?",
  "MidResFemaleC_10731": "I think I'm getting the hang of it.",
  "MidResFemaleC_10732": "Oh! Did you want to watch me practise? I don't mind.",
  "MidResFemaleC_10733": "No, no, not again!",
  "MidResFemaleC_10734": "Oh well. I'll manage it eventually.",
  "MidResFemaleC_10754": "Put those out, for Merlin's sake!",
  "MidResFemaleC_10764": "(laughter)",
  "MidResFemaleC_10768": "Argh!",
  "MidResFemaleC_10769": "You impossible poltergeist! You should be ashamed of yourself.",
  "MidResFemaleC_10770": "That's one thing I won't miss about Hogwarts.",
  "MidResFemaleC_10800": "She's right, why don't you leave goblins alone, you troll?",
  "MidResFemaleC_10801": "I'm a prefect too, you twit!",
  "MidResFemaleC_10805": "What have I done now? The Headmaster is coming this way.",
  "MidResFemaleC_10806": "What? Professor Black. Here?",
  "MidResFemaleC_10815": "(cheers)",
  "MidResFemaleC_10816": "(celebratory cheers)",
  "MidResFemaleC_10938": "I wonder –",
  "MidResFemaleC_10939": "It's – brilliant.",
  "MidResFemaleC_10940": "Argh!",
  "MidResFemaleC_10941": "(laughter)",
  "MidResFemaleC_10942": "Good breeze for it today.",
  "MidResFemaleC_10943": "Lovely, aren't they?",
  "MidResFemaleC_10945": "Must be – different – starting Hogwarts in your fifth year.",
  "MidResFemaleC_10946": "Have you heard Lenora Everleigh going on about a mystery frame? Belongs in St Mungo's, if you ask me.",
  "MidResFemaleC_10955": "Eck! What is this? ",
  "MidResFemaleC_11128": "Nellie'll do anything for a thrill.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11129": "Shame you weren't born with wings, Nellie. I'm sure you'd use them. ",
  "MidResFemaleC_11130": "She gets bolder every year.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11131": "Don't fall off this time, Nellie! ",
  "MidResFemaleC_11134": "Mind the wand!",
  "MidResFemaleC_11135": "I suppose in all fairness one should be prepared for anything.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11136": "Hmph. I asked Ronen what he'd recommend for a Billywig sting and he laughed and said 'Try not to be seen'. I don't find that funny at all.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11137": "Nobody can do a hex like me. And I dare you to prove me wrong. You saw that first-year with the engorged head? That was me.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11138": "My family has a lineage of exemplary fliers. It's no wonder Spintwitches is desperate for me to buy a broom there.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11139": "Showing off is a Muggle trait. You don't see that sort of behaviour in the wizarding world.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11140": "My parents visited the school once. All I can say is thank Merlin it's against school policy to let them in the common room.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11141": "It's no wonder Ravenclaws are so clever though, isn't it. Having to solve things every time you want to go into the common room; bit much, I'd say.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11142": "Slytherins almost always use the door to the right of the Entrance Hall.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11143": "It doesn't seem right to me; always encouraging me to keep plenty of Wiggenweld Potion in my trunk.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11144": "Slytherins are lucky they get to sleep next to the lake. Water is so soothing.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11145": "There's always someone snoring in our dormitory. One of the girls too. And she talks in her sleep.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11146": "We'd have more fun in our dormitory if the prefects would conveniently go on holiday.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11147": "My aunt made some Amortentia once; because she wasn't getting along well with my uncle.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11148": "I tried to brew some Amortentia once. It was an awful disaster. I thought he'd take an interest in me.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11149": "Do you think it's possible to spend time with any of the merpeople from the lake?",
  "MidResFemaleC_11150": "How are there so many lectures in Herbology?",
  "MidResFemaleC_11151": "My older brother used to terrorise me with a Fanged Geranium.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11152": "It's not the written exam that worries me with Herbology; it's the practical.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11153": "All of the shopkeepers like me, I know they do. They always put a bit of something extra in the bag for me. I think they're drawn to my charm. Also my parents spend a lot in Hogsmeade, but I don’t think that's it.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11154": "You can get all sorts of clothing at Gladrags. Not just common wear either. I've seen rare garments there; very powerful, I'd imagine. I can't say I feel the need for that sort of thing, mind. I'd be quite content with a new pair of socks.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11155": "Oh, do shut up.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11156": "Everybody knows you're in Remedial Potions.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11157": "I'd like to see your parents' faces when they see your marks at the end of term. Perhaps you should work on your Polyjuice Potion so you can pay them a visit as Sharp and lie yourself silly about how marvellous you are and how you 'exceeded expectations'.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11158": "Oh, did you hear about the new spell we're learning in Charms? I can't wait.  You know it's going to be a laugh with Ronen.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11159": "And have you seen how these professors look at your clothes? Black looks at me like I'm a pauper. I swear the man thinks I have fleas.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11160": "The professors are only trying to ensure that we're familiar with as much magic as possible.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11161": "Mr Weekes says I'd be a marvellous advertisement for his shop.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11162": "We're all naturally the epitome of competence so why would we need to show off?",
  "MidResFemaleC_11163": "We had more sweets stashed than all of Honeydukes. I have Black to thank for that one.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11164": "He wouldn't back down, even when my mother threatened to report him. Although he did give us all detention after. And took the sweets.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11165": "The stone steps are behind it, you can't miss them. If you're a Slytherin of course.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11167": "(frustrated groans)",
  "MidResFemaleC_11168": "It's as if she's planning to poison me in the night. And she sleeps next to me.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11169": "It's making me quite paranoid if I'm honest.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11170": "Always muttering on about meeting a boy at Steepley's. I think I know who it is too.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11171": "Howin says Cyprus is nice this time of year.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11172": "Seemed to do the trick. Although I did always suspect she'd actually given him a Sleeping Draught.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11173": "All he kept talking about was smelling 'wonderful dragon dung'. Turns out his family worked in fertiliser.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11174": "Not, I mean, a particular one. Just any of them. But if there was a particular one – never mind.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11175": "I always used to hear my mother speak of Herbology and it sounded delightful. I feel utterly tricked.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11176": "I shall never forgive Garlick for that. Fancy having one of those things around children?",
  "MidResFemaleC_11177": "I can barely recognise a toadstool let alone tell the difference between dungs.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11178": "Surely there can't be that much difference between what's consumed by a Mooncalf and a dragon?",
  "MidResFemaleC_11187": "You'll pay for this. I'm not sure how, but you will.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11188": "The nerve of some students – thinking they can simply go anywhere. Uninvited!",
  "MidResFemaleC_11189": "I'd bet my badge I heard someone.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11190": "This has gone on long enough. Who's there?",
  "MidResFemaleC_11191": "Drat. And I wanted to deduct some house points.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11192": "Well, if a student was here, they're not now. That's all that matters, I suppose.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11194": "I could never duel like that.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11195": "Professor Weasley said she'd help me with my Switching Spells after class. I think she's tired of finding partially Transfigured items about the classroom.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11196": "Desperately need to improve my Charms marks this year. Perhaps I can find a housemate to levitate.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11197": "I'm avoiding our common room today. Ronen's testing on <i>Accio</i> and students are summoning objects right and left. Nearly lost an eye to a rogue quill.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11198": "Someone prodded a Mimbulus mimbletonia in the common room. Stinksap everywhere. I'm avoiding it entirely until they – or the house-elves – clean it up.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11199": "I brought sweets from Honeydukes to share with the girls in my dormitory tonight. No Acid Pops, though. Not before bed.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11200": "We stayed up almost the entire night the other week talking about schoolwork.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11201": "Tried what I thought was a smoothing elixir for my hair. Ugh, I think I was tricked. Smells like Flobberworm mucus. Ugh.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11202": "My father writes to me every week asking about classes and wondering if I've made any new friends. I dread mail. Every time our owl appears in the Great Hall I simply cringe.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11203": "As a Muggle-born, I never expected to come face to face with a man-eating cabbage.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11204": "Never seen Devil's Snare in the wild. Would be terrifying to encounter, I'd think. I'm happy to read about it, mind.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11205": "Hogsmeade's no London, mind you, but it'll do in a pinch.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11206": "Professor Hecat is intimidating, but then, she has a serious subject to teach. Can't afford to coddle students when it comes to Defence Against the Dark Arts.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11207": "At first I thought Professor Garlick might be too young to be a professor, but she's more than capable. Knows her Gillyweed from her Gurdyroot, that one.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11208": "My mother makes the most delicious Alihotsy fudge every Christmas. Can barely fit into my school robes when it's time to come back.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11209": "My entire family's been sorted into Hufflepuff – except for me that is. Makes sense. Not one for hard work if I'm honest.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11210": "My brother just started at Hogwarts as a Gryffindor. Thought for certain he’d be Slytherin – cunning as he is.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11211": "Do you think anyone has found every secret passage in Hogwarts? Wouldn't surprise me if new ones popped up occasionally.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11212": "I've been turned around on the Grand Staircase one too many times. I simply avoid it now.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11213": "I enjoy having lunch down by the lake. Except when the giant squid splashes about. Not much for soggy sandwiches.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11214": "Sometimes I wish I needed a new wand just so I’d have an excuse to visit Ollivanders again. I could open wand boxes all day.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11215": "Beatrice Green from Dogweed and Deathcap is an odd woman. Caught her talking to her plants the other day. Having a full conversation, she was. Quite interesting actually.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11216": "I'd like to do some window shopping in Hogsmeade this weekend. Don’t have the Galleons to actually buy anything.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11217": "I don't like how flying messes up my hair.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11218": "Do we really need to practise flying on a broomstick? I thought that was the purpose of trains.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11219": "Imelda Reyes is always arranging broom trials. She's only trying to top her old records. Such a show-off.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11220": "I'm far too afraid of heights to fly on a broom. What? It's nothing to be ashamed of. I don't see you racing about the towers.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11221": "Broomsticks are so out of date. I'd rather travel by Floo Network any day.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11222": "Professor Black was terrible before he decided to cancel Quidditch. That decision was the icing on the Cauldron Cake, if you ask me.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11223": "I can't believe Black is still the Headmaster. He obviously hates the job, and it's not like he's short a few Galleons.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11224": "I wish the Headmaster would retire. Let Professor Weasley take over for him.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11225": "It's been ages since I've sent an owl back home. My father'll be worrying. Perhaps next week.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11226": "I never know what to say when I write to my mother. 'Hello, Mother. Classes are horrendously boring and Professor Binns is still as dull as when you were in school.'",
  "MidResFemaleC_11227": "How many letters do you think come in and out of Hogwarts every day?",
  "MidResFemaleC_11228": "Owls must be incredibly intelligent to deliver all those letters. I still get lost looking for our common room.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11229": "Everyone knows you can't conjure food. Haven't you heard of Gamp's Law?",
  "MidResFemaleC_11230": "The most I've ever been able to conjure was a single quill. Not sure I'll ever master that one.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11231": "Do you think it's painful to be in a half-Transfigured state?",
  "MidResFemaleC_11232": "How rare are Metamorphmagi anyway?",
  "MidResFemaleC_11235": "Don't listen to him, Duncan. You're absolutely right to be wary of those horrid little furballs.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11236": "Lenora is so easily distracted.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11243": "I hope someone can knock Imelda down a peg.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11245": "I hear the bells again. Black will not be pleased about this! But the rest of us will.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11246": "Merlin's! Watch them fly!",
  "MidResFemaleC_11247": "Graphorn riding? Seems rather risky.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11248": "Is there anything more majestic than a Hippogriff in flight?",
  "MidResFemaleC_11249": "I can't say that I blame you – pyjamas are exceedingly comfortable.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11250": "Professor Fig will be sorely missed.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11251": "Armoured trolls? First I've heard of that.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11252": "The accounts of Ranrok and his Loyalists beneath the castle seem too incredible to be real.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11253": "It takes a fair bit of skill with a wand to win every duel Crossed Wands.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11254": "Never thought I'd see the day someone beat Imelda at her own game – er – trials.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11255": "I'd say you're the 'royalty' of Summoner's Court.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11256": "Bit of an adventurer, that Natty. I see her out and about all the time. Don't know where she's off to.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11257": "Poppy's got a soft spot for beasts. I think that speaks well of her.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11258": "Keep an eye out when you're with Sebastian. He's got a penchant for trouble, that one.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11259": "Amit's not a bad fellow, really. Bit too obsessed with stargazing for my taste, but seems nice enough.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11260": "Imelda's not too bad – if you don't mind the non-stop criticism.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11261": "Don't let your guard down with Everett. Has a particular proclivity for Dungbombs, that one.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11262": "Hogsmeade owes you a great debt. Well done taking down a fully grown troll!",
  "MidResFemaleC_11263": "Oh for the love of Merlin, you put him back?",
  "MidResFemaleC_11264": "You stuck that old cockroach's portrait in the Hog's Head? He'll hate that.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11265": "Ferdinand got what he deserved. We owe you a debt for destroying that twit's portrait.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11266": "How dare you.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11267": "Wouldn't it be easier to use a key?",
  "MidResFemaleC_11269": "I don't know how you did it, but you saved Hogwarts. You'll be remembered forever for this.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11270": "I reckon Sebastian did not expect such a sound defeat in Defence Against the Dark Arts.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11271": "I suppose it's nice that Poppy is befriending humans for a change.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11272": "What was that for?",
  "MidResFemaleC_11273": "It's so nice to hear the bells again! Thank you for putting things right – and annoying Professor Black in the process.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11274": "Oh! Hello.",
  "MidResFemaleC_11275": "Doing a bit of redecorating?",
  "MidResFemaleC_11276": "People get injured all the time in Quidditch. This is about more than that.",

  "MidResFemaleD_10922": "Well, I've yet to understand how one is expected to do the homework for Binns's class since that would require staying awake for it.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10923": "It's impossible to do all of the homework they give you. I think they do it on purpose.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10924": "The only place I'm able to concentrate is in the library. It's also somewhat exciting waiting for the inevitable breach of silence.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10925": "Well, Madam Kogawa said she's never seen anyone with such form on a broom. She even had the rest of the class watch me to see how it's done.",

  "MidResFemaleD_10927": "I once flew to Ipswich and back. Yes I did, don't look at me like that. I've seen all the moors. Every one of them. They all look the same.",

  "MidResFemaleD_10929": "I find its location a little untoward myself.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10930": "It's my favourite place in the entire school. If I didn't have that fireplace to sit next to I think I should be terribly homesick.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10931": "All I can say is, it's lucky the boys have their own dormitories. The mess they make!",
  "MidResFemaleD_10932": "Some of us are tidier than others though, aren't we? You don't have to look far to know who the disgrace is in our dormitory.",

  "MidResFemaleD_10935": "Don't talk to me about humiliation. My broom went up like a bit of flint the other day.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10936": "If someone says you have eyes like a Demiguise, is that a compliment?",
  "MidResFemaleD_10937": "I wish Professor Garlick would teach us more about Flesh-Eating Trees. There seems so little about them; perhaps one day someone will write a book on them.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10938": "When my grandfather went to this school, Dilys Derwent was the Headmistress. Marvellous Healer, apparently; very highly regarded. Bet she did better in Potions than I'm doing in Herbology.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10939": "I did tell you not to put too much dragon manure on your Screechsnap seedlings.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10940": "Augustus Hill just wants you to buy something though. He's always talking his game, and then look at his face if you don't buy something; he's like a child with an empty pillowcase on Christmas morn.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10941": "When I'm in Hogsmeade I always pay a visit to Dogweed and Deathcap. Although Madam Green can be a little fiery sometimes so you definitely want to stay on her good side.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10942": "I wish we didn't have to use a dagger in Potions. I'm not the least bit comfortable with it. 'Crush with the flat side of the dagger'. It's most untoward if you ask me. The thing's lethal. I feel I'd be safer if I were being schooled by Rookwood.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10943": "Have you ever had a cauldron leak? I didn't think it was possible and then one minute I was stirring and the next I was swimming in Wolfsbane Potion. Sharp almost threw his wand at me, I swear. Turned out I'd just spilt my flask. Wasn't my fault.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10944": "Is it possible to become an Auror and not excel in Potions? I'd think so, wouldn't you? It's all about demeanour really, isn't it, being an Auror; having a commanding stature. I think I shall be a force to be reckoned with.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10945": "If I had to pick a professor to race against it'd be Hecat. I'm serious, she's a thousand years old. Or seventy-five or something.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10946": "I enjoy Divination, but when is Professor Onai going to tell us more about Africa? I've learnt enough about ornithomancy to last me a lifetime; I want to hear about the Serengeti.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10947": "Even Madam Scribner's shown sympathy on that front and that's saying something.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10948": "I've been riding Hippogriffs since I was five. Comes naturally to me. And I've only been to hospital four times.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10949": "I believe every common room has one.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10950": "If you ask me, the best thing about the Slytherin common room is that you don't have to walk far to Potions.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10953": "(frustrated groans)",
  "MidResFemaleD_10954": "There's not a one of them comes out of there that doesn't look completely unkempt.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10955": "Can't imagine he'd appreciate being spied on all the time by prefects.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10956": "Scorched all the bottom of my robes, it did. And there were five boys watching, all from Gryffindor. Simply awful.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10957": "Professor Howin was out on a stroll and said she thought she'd heard a banshee. I don't sing anymore.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10966": "Is someone sneaking about?",
  "MidResFemaleD_10967": "Whoever's there, you'd best get yourself back to bed.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10968": "You are most certainly up to no good, out in the castle now. Be on your way.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10969": "The Headmaster will hear about this. Not the wisest move on your part, wandering about at this hour.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10970": "So much for a break from the tedium.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10971": "Hmph. No reason to get my wand in a knot after all.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10972": "How dare you step foot in here!",
  "MidResFemaleD_10973": "I've half a mind to haul you up to the Headmaster's office.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10974": "If I have to cast <i>Revelio</i> to find you, it won't be the last spell I cast.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10975": "Is that a student? In the Faculty Tower?",
  "MidResFemaleD_10976": "All clear here.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10977": "(yawns) Well, I've done my part.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10978": "Lenora thinks she's quite the arts afficionado.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10981": "Lenora's got someone else staring at empty paintings now.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10983": "Perhaps it's a prank. Like the Emperor with no clothes.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10985": "Some big hits that round.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10986": "Aghh!",
  "MidResFemaleD_10987": "Amit Thakkar is already studying for O.W.L.s. No wonder he doesn't have any friends.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10988": "I'm not going to lose any more sleep over my Potions homework. Brewed myself a Sleeping Draught just to be sure.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10989": "Always wondered what the other houses' common rooms looked like. Ours is the best, of course. Still, I do wonder.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10990": "Someone was practising with a broken wand in the common room last night. Looked like a war had broken out.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10991": "Emily promised to help me style my hair. Give her a ribbon and a wand and she can do anything.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10992": "All I have at home are brothers. I thought sharing a room with girls would be tidier. Clearly, I was wrong. Thank goodness for the Scouring Charm.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10993": "The Sorting Hat took ages to sort that poor first-year from Upper Hogsfield. Couldn't find a strong enough trait, is my guess. How awkward.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10994": "My sister read my diary. Ugh. Entirely unfair that my mother wouldn't let me put a locking charm on it.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10995": "I can't memorise ten magical herbs, let alone one thousand magical herbs and fungi. When would you even use them all? It's absurd.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10996": "Almost fainted trying to harvest a Puffapod the other day. Those spores certainly make you dizzy.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10997": "I'd love to have a house in one of the nearby hamlets. Imagine being able to pop into Hogsmeade for a Butterbeer whenever you wanted.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10998": "Professor Onai has fascinating stories about growing up in Uganda. Wish she'd teach us how to do wandless magic like they do at Uagadou.",
  "MidResFemaleD_10999": "I'm convinced that behind her rather stodgy exterior, Professor Weasley's  had some rather marvellous adventures.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11000": "I adore playing wizard chess with my siblings. A bit violent, but father says it’s a good way to get out our frustrations.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11001": "Never a dull moment when I go home for the holidays. Last year, my mother swore she heard a banshee. She couldn’t sleep for fear that one of us was doomed.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11002": "It's tradition in my family to play a game of Quidditch on the moors during the holidays.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11003": "Do you find yourself taking certain ways to class based on the portraits you pass? I do. Some are much better conversationalists than others.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11004": "The gardens at Hogwarts are impressive. Do you think Garlick maintains them? With the help of house-elves, obviously.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11005": "I'd spend all day in the Great Hall if I could. It's always so warm and lively.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11006": "Quite a few hamlets outside of Hogsmeade. I'm going to try and visit them all this year.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11007": "I enjoy my weekly visits to Dogweed and Deathcap. I find I'm more comfortable around plants than people, to be honest.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11008": "Sirona at the Three Broomsticks always gives such good advice. Don't know how she remembers who we all are, either.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11009": "I think it's for the best that Kogawa takes flying seriously. Far too easy for first-years to injure themselves in class. Not to say that's not amusing.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11010": "One boy fell off his broom during my Flying class. Good thing Kogawa was there to catch him.  She's very good at <i>Arresto Momentum</i>.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11011": "Have you ever flown over the Black Lake and seen the squid? Obviously, I have. Was just wondering.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11012": "Imelda Reyes is on her way to becoming the fastest flier in Hogwarts history!",
  "MidResFemaleD_11013": "I think Madam Kogawa's brother is a professional Quidditch player. Wish I could meet him.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11014": "I've no doubt that Black will be remembered as the worst Headmaster Hogwarts has ever seen. No ability to have a rapport with his pupils whatsoever.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11015": "Why would Black want to be Headmaster of Hogwarts? Course, I’m not sure what job he’d actually be good at. Perhaps something at Azkaban.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11016": "What do you think Black's wife is like? She must be miserable. Although not while he's here perhaps.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11017": "Once, my sister sent me a Howler simply because I brought one of her scarves to school with me. She never even wears it.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11018": "I can't imagine receiving a Howler. Especially in front of the whole school during a feast.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11019": "I hope to have an owl of my own one day.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11020": "My family's owl is getting too old. Half of the letters end up in the local pond.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11021": "My cousin was transfigured into a mouse by an older bully last year. Took hours to get her to come out from under the bed.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11022": "I managed to conjure a hedgehog once, but it disappeared after a few minutes. Shame.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11023": "My mother adored Transfiguration when she was in school. I'm sure she's disappointed that I'm so terrible at it.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11024": "I used to like Transfiguration, but now it seems to be getting awfully complicated.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11031": "Shame the new fifth-year didn't beat Imelda’s time.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11032": "Wonder if they can hear us down here. Hello!",
  "MidResFemaleD_11033": "How are they able to control a Graphorn?",
  "MidResFemaleD_11034": "Oh, what a beautiful Hippogriff!",
  "MidResFemaleD_11035": "Making our mark in fashion, are we?",
  "MidResFemaleD_11036": "I haven't seen Professor Fig in a while now; I hope he's all right.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11037": "Professor Fig seemed so unshakeable. I can't believe he's gone.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11038": "Trolls don't just show up in Hogsmeade.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11039": "Who would've imagined the Loyalists to be so organised.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11040": "Still can't believe you won every single Crossed Wands battle!",
  "MidResFemaleD_11041": "You should consider professional Quidditch.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11042": "Nice work at Summoner's Court by the way.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11043": "If it isn't Natty's other half!",
  "MidResFemaleD_11044": "Who knew Poppy was capable of making friends.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11045": "You and Sebastian are thick as thieves these days.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11046": "Glad to see you and Amit becoming chums.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11047": "I wonder if anyone else is terrified of Imelda.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11048": "If it isn't Everett's best friend!",
  "MidResFemaleD_11049": "Were you scared when the trolls attacked? I'd have been terrified.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11050": "So much for our freedom from Ferdinand.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11051": "I wonder how Ferdinand's faring in the Hog's Head.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11052": "Thank Merlin Ferdinand's portrait was destroyed!",
  "MidResFemaleD_11053": "Don't do that near me.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11054": "Locked doors never stay locked around here.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11056": "You're an honest to goodness hero, you are.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11057": "Goodness, how did you beat Sebastian in that duel?",
  "MidResFemaleD_11058": "Watch what you're doing.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11059": "I can't believe those infernal bells are ringing again.",
  "MidResFemaleD_11060": "Goodness!",

  "MidResFemaleE_10539": "I wonder if it's even quieter in the Restricted Section of the library? And what would happen if you made a noise?",
  "MidResFemaleE_10540": "There's simply too much information if you ask me. Surely it's not all necessary? Next thing you know they'll be teaching us about Muggles.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10541": "When I fell off my broom and broke six bones. They said they'd never seen Skele-Gro work so fast.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10542": "Our neighbour at home knows someone who's related to the inventor of Skele-Gro. It's true. Linfred of Stinchcombe his name was.",

  "MidResFemaleE_10544": "Why would Helga Hufflepuff have you tap on barrels though? That's the only thing that mystifies me.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10545": "If you ask any Hufflepuff they'll tell you there's a badger in their common room.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10546": "I bet Garlick had a say in it. Why else would it be the only common room with plants? She's obviously showing favouritism.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10547": "Weasley said she always found the dormitory a good place to read. Better than the library.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10548": "I don't trust any of the boys. You find one Venomous Tentacula on your pillow and you don't soon forget.",

  "MidResFemaleE_10550": "When someone says something nice to you, it's only because they want something.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10551": "I thought a boy was trying to be nice to me the other day. Offered to carry my books, he did. Oh, charming, I thought.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10552": "Someone passed me a note in class with a heart on it. I went bright red.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10553": "You shouldn't get so upset in Herbology. The rate you're going, you'll need a Calming Draught.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10554": "I don't mind Herbology myself. I'll take a Mandrake any day over annoying little Puffskein.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10555": "Well, I don't find Herbology the least bit amusing. I've been smacked in the face twice now by a Bouncing Bulb and Garlick didn't do a thing. Don't laugh.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10556": "The last time I was at Dogweed and Deathcap, Madam Green had everything from dittany seeds to Shrivelfigs. Just be careful not to upset her though or she might set a Venomous Tentacula on you.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10557": "Anyone fancy going to Brood and Peck with me? I've been wanting to go for ages. My friend said they have very high-quality feathers and I need one from a Jobberknoll.  Can't remember why.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10558": "I need someone to lend me some potions ingredients. Don't give me that look, I told you before I was only musing about a Love Potion; as if I'd actually brew one? I wouldn't have the faintest idea what to put in one let alone finding Powdered Moonstone or Ashwinder eggs.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10559": "I had an awful time in Potions the other day. Someone had scribbled all over the pages of my Book of Potions; the margins were as black as soot. And it was a copy from library; Scribner's going to have me for that.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10560": "My aunt has some potions recipes she swears are from Zygmunt Budge himself. What? She wouldn't make it up. She says they're ones he didn't put in the Book of Potions. Likely powerful spells for the complexion. What? Why are you looking at my chin like that? Stop it.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10561": "I wonder if you learn different things about Astronomy at Uagadou? Although I can't see anyone being as passionate about it as Shah.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10562": "I'm going to have my own telescope one day. I've already decided that Jupiter's my favourite planet. Although I suppose Saturn's got the rings going for it.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10563": "Said I must have special marrow in my bones or something. They did.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10564": "And our neighbour's best friend Sally had a friend down the lane whose great-great grandfather knew the man who used to tend his hedge.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10565": "Apparently very nice it was. Probably ficus.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10566": "(exasperated groans)",
  "MidResFemaleE_10567": "My mother's extremely thoughtful and I'm afraid I have more knitted socks than a Gladrags Christmas bizarre.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10568": "I don't think they'd let me have two trunks though. I suppose the dormitory isn't especially spacious.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10569": "Likely that was before we had Madam Scribner reigning over things.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10570": "I keep a sharp eye now, I can tell you that.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10571": "That's what my mother says, which is disconcerting because she always tells me I'm clever.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10572": "Just wonder what she's after.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10573": "Then they told me to pass it to the girl sat next to me.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10574": "Got to class and only realised he'd pilfered my homework. And it was Conjuring Spells.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10575": "Took me ages, that did.  I suppose it was nice while it lasted.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10576": "I never thought I'd actually enjoy Herbology, but Professor Garlick makes it so interesting. She’s forgotten more than I’ll ever know about Mandrakes.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10577": "I wouldn't say Professor Howin has a particular affinity for beasts, but she's certainly knowledgeable. I imagine that’s why she teaches the class.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10578": "Why study in the common room when you can be outside in the fresh air? I'd rather be in the courtyard than a musty old library any day.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10579": "The chairs in the common room are too comfortable. Closed my eyes for two seconds the other day. Woke up two hours after Charms.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10580": "I find the girls to be messier than trolls, truth be told.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10581": "I miss having my own bedroom. One of the girls in our room recites potion recipes in her sleep, another sings, and another mumbles incantations.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10582": "Accidentally levitated Professor Ronen's sandwich once. He was fine about it. Actually complimented me on my wandwork.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10583": "Did you see Claire's hair today? She tried a colour-changing charm on it and it's essentially the colour of dragon dung.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10584": "Wish I could've studied here when Phyllida Spore was Headmistress. Greatest Herbologist of all time. I've read One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi at least a thousand times.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10585": "I'm trying to grow some Asphodel in the greenhouses. Such a beautiful flower – I almost hate drying out the roots for Potions.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10586": "My aunt says I should get to Hogsmeade as often as I can. Says it's good to get out of the castle sometimes.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10587": "Sharp was in a mood the other day. Not a single student got their Sleeping Draught right and he vanished the contents of every cauldron in the room with one cast.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10588": "Defence Against the Dark Arts can be intimidating, but Professor Hecat actually makes it seem manageable.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10589": "My family has been sorted into Ravenclaw for generations. Bit of a bookish lot one might say.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10590": "All of my siblings have gone on to work for the Ministry, but I'm not sure I want to do that. Unless it's as an Auror. I'd like to be an Auror.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10591": "My family has a lot of Muggle traditions. From my mother's side. I don't mind most of them. But cooking without magic can get exhausting.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10592": "Have you ever seen a professor outside the castle? I find it jarring to see someone like Professor Weasley at the Three Broomsticks.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10593": "Wish I could see what Hogwarts looks like to Muggles. Bet it's terrifying.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10594": "I adore spending sunny afternoons in the viaduct courtyard. Wonderful place to practise <i>Accio</i> – on other students’ books.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10595": "I'd like to shop in the hamlets, but I'm too afraid to venture out alone with all that's going on.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10596": "Life seems rather dull in the hamlets around here. I'd much rather live in a big city like London.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10597": "Thomas Brown knows more about books than anyone. Well, perhaps not Madam Scribner – but anyone else, I'd say.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10598": "The best way to learn how to fly a broomstick is by trial and error. In my case, it was a lot of error.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10599": "Albie Weekes has been experimenting with new broom models for a while now.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10600": "If you lean forward on your broom just right, you can get an incredible burst of speed.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10601": "I wish I could spend all day in Flying.  Should’ve been born a Hippogriff.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10602": "Wouldn't it be romantic to fly amongst the stars? Even Professor Shah might think so. Or not.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10603": "I thought about transferring to Beauxbatons just to get away from Professor Black and his iron fist. But then I remembered that I don’t speak French.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10604": "I doubt there's ever been a headmaster as hated as Black. Dubious honour indeed.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10605": "Whoever decided to make Professor Black Headmaster of Hogwarts must have been the victim of a flock of Fwoopers: out of their mind.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10606": "I've heard that Isaac Cooper receives several owls a week from secret admirers. I suppose he is rather dashing.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10607": "Wish someone would send me a love letter.  Doubt that'll ever happen.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10608": "My mother was shocked the first time I sent her an owl from Hogwarts. She'd never seen anything like it! She's a Muggle so of course that makes sense. What? Don't make that face.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10609": "How do owls know where to deliver their letters?",
  "MidResFemaleE_10610": "A Beginner's Guide to Transfiguration was my least favourite textbook. I cannot seem to wrap my head around the subject.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10611": "I hated learning Vanishment. Never had such abysmal marks.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10612": "I'm dreading taking my Transfiguration O.W.L. Absolutely dreading it. I'd rather jinx myself than have to explain reasons for the exceptions to Gamp’s Law.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10613": "Transfiguration requires such precision. I once turned my pet rabbit into a candlestick. Mother was furious when she set the table and it hopped away.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10614": "Me, too. Had my eye on a new frock from Gladrags for weeks.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10621": "I hope I'm next. I’ll be the fastest.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10622": "What did you do that for?",
  "MidResFemaleE_10623": "Wonder if they'd get detention for flying this far out here.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10624": "Wonder if that Graphorn's tame. Seems awfully dangerous.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10625": "If I could ride a Hippogriff I'd show off too.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10626": "Taking a stroll in our pyjamas, are we?",
  "MidResFemaleE_10628": "Never knew Fig well but it sounds as if he was a remarkable man.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10629": "I hope my mother didn't hear about the troll attack. She'd take me straight out of school.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10630": "Might need a Sleeping Draught. I've had nightmares about Loyalists ever since the siege.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10631": "Well done at Crossed Wands. You're a natural.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10632": "That must be a record, beating Imelda three times!",
  "MidResFemaleE_10633": "You absolutely smashed it at Summoner's Court!",
  "MidResFemaleE_10634": "Having fun spending time with Natty?",
  "MidResFemaleE_10635": "I hear Poppy's adopted you too.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10636": "You and Sebastian are best friends now? Don't let Ominis hear about it.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10637": "Where's Amit? I heard the two of you are friends now.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10638": "I'm glad you're friends with Imelda. Up until now, I assumed her best friend was her broomstick.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10639": "You and Everett get up to anything fun lately?",
  "MidResFemaleE_10640": "Thank goodness you really are in one piece. I heard that troll was thunderous.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10642": "Can't believe you put Ferdinand's frame back in the Three Broomsticks?",
  "MidResFemaleE_10643": "I hope Ferdinand gets his just dues in the Hog's Head.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10644": "Heard you burned Ferdinand's painting. Thank you from us all.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10645": "Think something interesting's behind that lock?",
  "MidResFemaleE_10646": "My uncle was sent to Azkaban for that.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10649": "You really showed those Ashwinders, didn’t you?",
  "MidResFemaleE_10650": "Those loyalists never stood a chance. Brilliant work.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10651": "I hear we have you to thank for saving the school. I don’t know how you did it.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10652": "Good work, out-duelling Sebastian.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10653": "You're new, so you wouldn't know, but most of us consider Poppy a bit of an odd bird.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10654": "You can do better than that!",
  "MidResFemaleE_10655": "I don’t know how you went against the poachers and made it out alive.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10656": "I'm so relieved to hear those bells ringing again.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10657": "Oof! Do be careful.",
  "MidResFemaleE_10658": "Nerida simply stands by the water, staring down. Why won't she learn how to swim?",

  "MidResMaleA_10650": "Wail till I tell my father. It'll be me laughing then!",
  "MidResMaleA_10651": "Not as if I can simply go to the library and look up a spell in this state.",
  "MidResMaleA_10652": "I'm sh-sh-shivering t-t-too much to c-c-cast.",
  "MidResMaleA_10653": "I can't feel my fingers.",
  "MidResMaleA_10655": "Not enough snow to build a snowman with!",
  "MidResMaleA_10662": "Argh!",
  "MidResMaleA_10669": "Brrr.",
  "MidResMaleA_10670": "Why would someone do this to me?",
  "MidResMaleA_10671": "You'd think people would have better things to do than conjure snowfalls.",
  "MidResMaleA_10672": "Merlin's beard, it's cold.",

  "MidResMaleA_10879": "Anne was hurt so badly that she couldn't attend school? What do you make of that?",
  "MidResMaleA_10880": "I suppose I could take a moment to get to know Gaunt too.",
  "MidResMaleA_10897": "Retiring for the evening already?",
  "MidResMaleA_10898": "I won't forget Imelda's defeat any time soon. Great work.",

  "MidResMaleA_10921": "Imagine surviving a goblin attack. Most impressive.",

  "MidResMaleA_10965": "You're better than that!",
  "MidResMaleA_10966": "Yes, but, what good is knowledge? When you really think about it?",
  "MidResMaleA_10967": "Madam Scribner doesn't tolerate any nonsense so I find the library's the best place for concentration. As long as she doesn't hear you breathe.",
  "MidResMaleA_10968": "What does it matter whether we even do our homework? I just want to be a baker on Carnaby Street. I don't think that even requires magic.",
  "MidResMaleA_10969": "I don't think it's anything special if your family works at the Ministry. Makes them a boring lot if you ask me.",
  "MidResMaleA_10970": "Well, I had a friend who once went to a Muggle doctor. It's the truth. She'd fallen over in Piccadilly Circus visiting a relative.",
  "MidResMaleA_10971": "Anyone in the wizarding world could outdo the best a Muggle has to offer any day.",
  "MidResMaleA_10972": "It would be far more enjoyable if the prefects stayed out of the common rooms. Should get rid of the lot of them.",
  "MidResMaleA_10973": "Someone was sat by the fire in our common room the other day with steam coming out of their ears.",
  "MidResMaleA_10974": "There's only one common room that everyone wishes they could get in and that's Hufflepuff. Been that way for a thousand years or so Garlick says.",
  "MidResMaleA_10975": "As long as I get some sleep I don't mind what anyone gets up to. The dormitory should be a place where rules don't apply.",
  "MidResMaleA_10976": "I've been sending owls to my mother pleading with her to send my favourite nightshirt.",
  "MidResMaleA_10977": "Well, one can't argue with that.",
  "MidResMaleA_10978": "I tried to send a note to someone I like. If only I hadn't done it in Potions.",
  "MidResMaleA_10979": "Do you think I have a big forehead? You can be honest.",
  "MidResMaleA_10980": "Since when should it matter what anyone looks like? Surely it's about cleverness? Or wealth?",
  "MidResMaleA_10981": "If those Bouncing Bulbs get big they can be quite strong. I'd keep an eye you don't get one that's too mature or you'll be having to cast the Fire-Making Spell and I'm sure that won't go over well if Garlick tells Black.",
  "MidResMaleA_10982": "I've never had difficulties with Bouncing Bulbs. Simple Knockback Jinx on hand's all you need.",
  "MidResMaleA_10983": "If someone wouldn't mind letting me know when the class about fertiliser's coming up, I'd be very grateful. That's one I shall definitely feign a bit of dragon pox for.",
  "MidResMaleA_10984": "I wonder what it was like in Hogsmeade before 1714? I'd imagine things were far less orderly.",
  "MidResMaleA_10985": "Anyone been into Albie Weekes's shop lately? I'm always looking for an excuse to go to Spintwitches, even if I can't afford a new broom.",
  "MidResMaleA_10986": "I don't know why Sharp's always referring to 'standard ingredients'. Nothing is standard. Who's walking around with mistletoe berries?",
  "MidResMaleA_10987": "Can't somebody let me copy their Potions homework? I'm at least moderately good at Charms and I promise I'll let you copy mine.",
  "MidResMaleA_10988": "I'm just saying, you'd thinks she was the pioneer of the Wizarding Schools Potions Championship the way she carries herself. And she's a first-year. No need to look at me like that, and I know what you're about to say so you can hold your tongue; I do not talk about her all the time. You haven't seen her about, have you?",
  "MidResMaleA_10989": "Speaking of Astronomy, I'm surprised you're not fixated on Venus the amount of time you spend talking about Amit Thakkar.",
  "MidResMaleA_10990": "It's so much better when it gets dark earlier. I'd spend all night in that Astronomy Tower if they'd let me. How can you not be absolutely fascinated with the stars? I should let Shah adopt me.",
  "MidResMaleA_10991": "I'd take having a parent who's good with pancakes any day.",
  "MidResMaleA_10992": "And on account of the Statute and all, they had to take her to a 'Dr Malcolm'. She had a bandage all up to her knee.",
  "MidResMaleA_10993": "Can you imagine? Was only a scratch, she said. Can't be very strong, can they, Muggles?",
  "MidResMaleA_10994": "A third-year had put Pepperup Potion in their Butterbeer in Hogsmeade. I found the whole thing quite marvellous.",
  "MidResMaleA_10996": "(disappointed groans)",
  "MidResMaleA_10997": "Do you know what she said? She's letting the dog sleep on it because it stops her whining.",
  "MidResMaleA_10998": "The both of us ended up in detention, which was divine.",
  "MidResMaleA_10999": "Only someone said I look like a Ramora and I think it's to do with my forehead.",
  "MidResMaleA_11000": "Pfft. I certainly won't be worrying if I have a spot on my nose.",
  "MidResMaleA_11005": "No student would dare wander in here. Not on my watch.",
  "MidResMaleA_11006": "If that were a student they'd have been sorry.",
  "MidResMaleA_11007": "What trickery are you up to?",
  "MidResMaleA_11008": "You are to be remanded at once!",
  "MidResMaleA_11009": "That had better not be another student I hear.",
  "MidResMaleA_11010": "I wouldn't be a prefect if I didn't enforce the rules.",
  "MidResMaleA_11012": "Glad I didn't bet on that round.",
  "MidResMaleA_11013": "Professor Hecat is an enigma. I think she used to work for the Ministry. Wonder how she ended up here.",
  "MidResMaleA_11014": "Not sure we should study for the Astronomy exam in the library. Might be better off outdoors where we can see the stars.",
  "MidResMaleA_11015": "Even if I knew how to get into the other common rooms, I wouldn't bother. There's a reason I was sorted into my house.",
  "MidResMaleA_11016": "It's astonishing what one can learn when keeping one's mouth shut in the common room. People feel at liberty to talk about anything there.",
  "MidResMaleA_11017": "I haven't slept in days! Martin snores like a Mountain Troll.",
  "MidResMaleA_11018": "It's astonishing to me that the five lads I share a dorm with don't accumulate half the mess my one sister makes at home.",
  "MidResMaleA_11019": "I accidentally dropped a Flobberworm down my robes in Potions once. You'd think I'd been hit with Tarantallegra the way I was prancing. Mortifying, it was.",
  "MidResMaleA_11020": "I was a late bloomer. My parents thought I was going to be a Squib. Family still tease me about it.",
  "MidResMaleA_11021": "Something so peaceful about tending to magical plants. Venomous Tentacula being a notable exception.",
  "MidResMaleA_11022": "I could wander the greenhouses for hours. Just need to avoid the Venomous Tentacula and the Devil's Snare.",
  "MidResMaleA_11023": "I could spend all my Galleons at Honeydukes – and just on Fizzing Whizzbees!",
  "MidResMaleA_11024": "If I had to pick a favourite professor, I'd choose Garlick. Underneath that chipper persona lies a brilliant Herbological mind.",
  "MidResMaleA_11025": "How can one not fancy Professor Garlick? She's brilliant with plants, and her energy is captivating.",
  "MidResMaleA_11026": "I'm glad I don't have to stay in the castle for the holidays. I find the moving staircases unnerving when no one's around.",
  "MidResMaleA_11027": "All of my siblings have finished at Hogwarts. Nice to be here on my own for once.",
  "MidResMaleA_11028": "I miss playing Gobstones on the kitchen floor with my cousins. Not the same here in the courtyard.",
  "MidResMaleA_11029": "Have you been in any other common rooms? I'd love to know what it's like to be in another house – just for a day.",
  "MidResMaleA_11030": "The portraits in the castle don't always have something interesting to say, but many of them do chatter on nonetheless.",
  "MidResMaleA_11031": "Have you ever been to the kitchens? I hear it's run by house-elves.",
  "MidResMaleA_11032": "I hear Feldcroft's been getting attacked by Ranrok's Loyalists. You’ll not find me there any time soon.",
  "MidResMaleA_11033": "Albie Weekes from Spintwitches has such interesting notions about how to improve brooms. Knows his stuff, he does, that one.",
  "MidResMaleA_11034": "I could just have a Butterbeer from the Three Broomsticks right now. And a chat with Sirona. Both are excellent tonics.",
  "MidResMaleA_11035": "Why do we even have Flying if Professor Black cancelled Quidditch?",
  "MidResMaleA_11036": "I was going to try out for the Quidditch team this year.",
  "MidResMaleA_11037": "Nothing beats a leisurely evening flight.",
  "MidResMaleA_11038": "I think I'll go for a quick sprint on my broom after class tonight. I find it helps stimulate my mind. Especially if we've had class with Professor Binns.",
  "MidResMaleA_11039": "Everyone falls off their broom at least once. You just have to get back on!",
  "MidResMaleA_11040": "What was the Ministry thinking putting Black in charge of a bunch of children? He hates children.",
  "MidResMaleA_11041": "I wish there was something I could do to stand up to the Headmaster. Likely best to simply keep my head down till I finish up here.",
  "MidResMaleA_11042": "Hogwarts hasn't been the same since Black took over. Lucky for us we have Professor Weasley.",
  "MidResMaleA_11043": "My mother sent me a Howler after I got a 'poor' on my Transfiguration O.W.L. Without a doubt one of the most embarrassing moments of my life.",
  "MidResMaleA_11044": "I don't send many owls to myself, but it is nice to get them. What? Don't look at me like that.",
  "MidResMaleA_11045": "There are a few students here I'd like to send a Howler to.",
  "MidResMaleA_11046": "Owls fascinate me. They have a lot of responsibility in the wizarding world. Imagine all the walking we'd have to do if we didn't have owls to deliver our post.",
  "MidResMaleA_11047": "Transfiguration's far too difficult for me. Much prefer Potions. I like to have a recipe to follow.",
  "MidResMaleA_11048": "Why does the Ministry require Animagi to register themselves? Seems most intrusive to me.",
  "MidResMaleA_11049": "Sometimes I wish someone would Transfigure me into a squirrel. Then I wouldn't have to worry about doing schoolwork anymore.",
  "MidResMaleA_11050": "I tried transforming a rabbit into a dinner plate the other day. Ended up with a platter that had long ears. Disaster.",
  "MidResMaleA_11052": "Not a chance. I'm not risking my neck to help her.",
  "MidResMaleA_11053": "I never thought someone would ever best Imelda's time.",
  "MidResMaleA_11091": "Someone's been paying attention in Madam Kogawa's class.",
  "MidResMaleA_11092": "Who'd ever choose to travel by Graphorn?",
  "MidResMaleA_11093": "Hope they're holding on tight.",
  "MidResMaleA_11094": "You do know it's called 'sleepwear' for a reason.",
  "MidResMaleA_11095": "To think I just saw Fig a few days ago.",
  "MidResMaleA_11096": "So glad I wasn’t in the village when the trolls attacked.",
  "MidResMaleA_11097": "I trust Ranrok's Loyalists won't be bothering the school ever again.",
  "MidResMaleA_11098": "Congratulations! Lucan told me the good news.",
  "MidResMaleA_11099": "Only a proper flying ace could beat Imelda's three times.",
  "MidResMaleA_11100": "If it isn't the Summoner's Court champion!",
  "MidResMaleA_11101": "Where's your new friend, Natty?",
  "MidResMaleA_11102": "You and Poppy must be saving loads of beasts together.",
  "MidResMaleA_11103": "Wonder what it's like being friends with Sebastian.",
  "MidResMaleA_11104": "Surprised Amit has time for friends. He's always studying.",
  "MidResMaleA_11105": "Nice to see Imelda making friends for a change.",
  "MidResMaleA_11106": "Looks like Everett found someone to help him with his schemes.",
  "MidResMaleA_11107": "Good on you for stopping that troll!",
  "MidResMaleA_11108": "Ferdinand does add a bit of colour to the Three Broomsticks.",
  "MidResMaleA_11109": "Poor Ferdinand – the Hog's Head of all places.",
  "MidResMaleA_11110": "Did Sirona get rid of Ferdinand?",
  "MidResMaleA_11111": "Where in Merlin's name did you learn to cast that?",
  "MidResMaleA_11112": "Those old locks can be tricky.",
  "MidResMaleA_11114": "Don't know where we'd be if Ranrok had succeeded.",
  "MidResMaleA_11115": "I can't remember the last time Sebastian lost a duel.",
  "MidResMaleA_11116": "The bells are ringing again. How delightful.",
  "MidResMaleA_11117": "Don't mind me.",
  "MidResMaleA_11118": "Who's going to clean all that up?",

  "MidResMaleB_10143": "Now there's a friendly face.",

  "MidResMaleB_10146": "Greetings.",
  "MidResMaleB_10147": "Hello.",

  "MidResMaleB_10647": "Haha! My turn!",
  "MidResMaleB_10679": "(sniffling)",
  "MidResMaleB_10680": "Now my socks are wet.",
  "MidResMaleB_10681": "Stupid bullies.",
  "MidResMaleB_10683": "Just my luck I don't know any weather spells.",
  "MidResMaleB_10684": "I keep making it worse.",
  "MidResMaleB_10685": "I can't recall the charm to stop the snowfall. If there is one.",
  "MidResMaleB_10686": "My wand's probably too frozen to cast a spell.",
  "MidResMaleB_10688": "I'd give anything for a hot Butterbeer.",
  "MidResMaleB_10695": "Argh!",
  "MidResMaleB_10702": "Brrr.",
  "MidResMaleB_10703": "And me without my best winter coat.",
  "MidResMaleB_10704": "At least it can't get any worse than this – can it?",
  "MidResMaleB_10705": "I'm not sure I'm still breathing.",
  "MidResMaleB_10706": "Is this what a Dementor's kiss feel like?",
  "MidResMaleB_10714": "Is it over? Finally.",
  "MidResMaleB_10731": "All right! Which of you jokers let the Snitch loose in here?",
  "MidResMaleB_10732": "Is the Snitch this annoying during Quidditch matches, too?",
  "MidResMaleB_10733": "No wonder everyone wants to catch it.",
  "MidResMaleB_10734": "Aaargh!",
  "MidResMaleB_10735": "If I see this thing again, I'm calling a prefect.",
  "MidResMaleB_10739": "Swish and flick. Who even cares?",
  "MidResMaleB_10740": "It's not as if it's hard to lift something in the air.",
  "MidResMaleB_10741": "Let's see the professor try and do this.",
  "MidResMaleB_10742": "I'm just trying to practise. I'm sure I'll have it soon.",
  "MidResMaleB_10743": "Whoops –",
  "MidResMaleB_10744": "I hate charms.",
  "MidResMaleB_10765": "That Peeves is going to set us all on fire!",
  "MidResMaleB_10777": "(laughter)",
  "MidResMaleB_10810": "What have we got here then, eh?",
  "MidResMaleB_10812": "Argh!",
  "MidResMaleB_10824": "Where's the Headmaster off to in such a hurry?",
  "MidResMaleB_10825": "Be on alert. Professor Black's on patrol.",
  "MidResMaleB_10834": "Missed.",
  "MidResMaleB_10835": "Oh, so close.",
  "MidResMaleB_10838": "Put me down or we shall have words.",
  "MidResMaleB_10839": "I don't like this at all.",
  "MidResMaleB_10840": "You've set me alight!",
  "MidResMaleB_10841": "Quick, put me out.",
  "MidResMaleB_10842": "I feel like – a yeti.",
  "MidResMaleB_10843": "Brr!",
  "MidResMaleB_10846": "Soon cut you down to size.",
  "MidResMaleB_10847": "Any cutting remarks?",
  "MidResMaleB_10848": "I hope you felt that.",
  "MidResMaleB_10850": "Ha. You'll have to do better than that.",
  "MidResMaleB_10851": "It'll take more than that.",
  "MidResMaleB_10852": "I barely felt that.",
  "MidResMaleB_10857": "I prefer roses, myself.",
  "MidResMaleB_10858": "Somebody's been raiding the greenhouse.",
  "MidResMaleB_10861": "It's worse than bagpipes.",
  "MidResMaleB_10862": "Put it back in the soil!",
  "MidResMaleB_10871": "Control your greens!",
  "MidResMaleB_10872": "I'm not one for greens.",
  "MidResMaleB_10873": "Er – that was mine.",
  "MidResMaleB_10874": "How rude.",
  "MidResMaleB_10875": "I'm feeling a bit sick.",
  "MidResMaleB_10876": "Could you please see to putting me back down?",
  "MidResMaleB_10877": "What – are you – doing?",
  "MidResMaleB_10878": "Stop this –",
  "MidResMaleB_10879": "Soon make compost of you.",
  "MidResMaleB_10880": "Blasted shrubs.",
  "MidResMaleB_10881": "That was unnecessary.",
  "MidResMaleB_10894": "I see someone's been paying attention in Flying.",
  "MidResMaleB_10895": "Can't go wrong with a broom.",
  "MidResMaleB_10897": "Riding a Graphorn? Well now I've seen everything.",
  "MidResMaleB_10898": "See that you don't trample anyone with that thing.",
  "MidResMaleB_10899": "I don't think the Ministry sanctioned Hippogriffs for transportation.",
  "MidResMaleB_10900": "Is that a – tame Hippogriff?",
  "MidResMaleB_10901": "What's Archie Bickle up to since you rescued him?",
  "MidResMaleB_10902": "Good of you to rescue that Hippogriff from the Rookwoods. I can't imagine what they had in store for it.",
  "MidResMaleB_10903": "Good to see Rabe's safe again.",
  "MidResMaleB_10904": "Rookwood's not to be trifled with, but that didn't stop you from bringing him to justice.",
  "MidResMaleB_10906": "It's only fitting that Sebastian gets detention. This isn't the first time he's been sneaking in the Restricted Section. Don't blame yourself.",
  "MidResMaleB_10907": "It must be very hard for Anne Sallow, being away from school for this long.",
  "MidResMaleB_10908": "What do you think of Gaunt, then? Saw you talking.",
  "MidResMaleB_10925": "Have you no sense of decorum?",
  "MidResMaleB_10926": "Your first year and you've already beat Imelda Reyes in a broom race. Who's next, the Chudley Cannons?",
  "MidResMaleB_10947": "You and Fig seem quite close. Is he tutoring you?",
  "MidResMaleB_10948": "Professor Fig was a true teacher. He'll be sorely missed.",
  "MidResMaleB_10949": "If goblins had attacked me I'd've just legged it out of there.",
  "MidResMaleB_10951": "If goblins learned one thing, it's that Hogwarts colours don't run.",
  "MidResMaleB_10959": "(laughter)",
  "MidResMaleB_10960": "Can you imagine one with Black's face on it? I'd pay good money for one of those.",
  "MidResMaleB_10961": "Take a look at that beauty!",
  "MidResMaleB_10963": "They're lucky they didn't end up as dragon food, like that poor man from the Ministry.",
  "MidResMaleB_10964": "Lenora talks for ages to an empty frame but can't spare one minute to talk to me.",
  "MidResMaleB_10973": "Come on, he went that way!",
  "MidResMaleB_10974": "Come on down, kitty. Come on.",
  "MidResMaleB_10989": "Who does Nellie think she is anyway?",
  "MidResMaleB_10990": "That girl thinks she can get away with anything.",
  "MidResMaleB_10991": "I hope a professor catches her this time.",
  "MidResMaleB_10992": "Nellie will do anything for attention.",
  "MidResMaleB_10995": "Is that all you've got?",
  "MidResMaleB_10996": "I'd never have a harsh word to say about Hogwarts. I for one could stay here forever. Better than where I'm from.",
  "MidResMaleB_10997": "Sometimes you can find some quite interesting things in the library.",
  "MidResMaleB_10998": "I just wish they'd hurry up and assign the essay on werewolves. When are we getting to that?",
  "MidResMaleB_10999": "Bravery runs in my family. I've never even cried. Even when my brother put a Grindylow in my bed. Possibly a bit of crying. But no tears.",
  "MidResMaleB_11000": "You're brave though, aren't you. I've seen you in Herbology. You're a conqueror with those Mandrakes.",
  "MidResMaleB_11001": "Fear is weakness. I never feel fear.",
  "MidResMaleB_11002": "Yes, but if we had a round of Gobstones in the common room it'd save us catching cold outside.",
  "MidResMaleB_11003": "I'd be glad if they let us convene at the Three Broomsticks instead.",
  "MidResMaleB_11004": "You can always tell the first-year Hufflepuffs. Reek of vinegar.",
  "MidResMaleB_11005": "You certainly sound like you have an opinion on this.",
  "MidResMaleB_11006": "I'm not entirely in agreement with what you're saying, but I do see your point.",
  "MidResMaleB_11007": "Woolly jumpers are a nightmare for getting in the trunk. And if you put your shoes in there as well, the smell.",
  "MidResMaleB_11008": "I haven't been feeling myself at all. I'd swear someone put Glumbumble treacle in my tea.",
  "MidResMaleB_11009": "When Howin said draw a Thestral, how was I to know you don't draw it next to a dead body?",
  "MidResMaleB_11010": "And why is she always holding his hand? I've seen them.",
  "MidResMaleB_11011": "I'm not looking forward at all to learning about the Snargaluff. There's a reason that thing has thorns.",
  "MidResMaleB_11012": "Perhaps you can meet me after Herbology and show me how I'm supposed to do that thing with the soil? I'm sure Garlick wouldn't mind us going to one of the greenhouses to practise?",
  "MidResMaleB_11013": "Personally, I think if the thing you're best at is Herbology, it means you're soft-hearted.",
  "MidResMaleB_11014": "I'm saving up for a new broom. Reckon I'll be going for the Yew Weaver or possibly a Silver Arrow. Albie Weekes says he'll give me a good price on one too.",
  "MidResMaleB_11015": "My house broom'll do me fine for a while, I'm sure. My parents keep promising me something to make up for the fact that they spoil my sister rotten. I think I'll just tell them to kit me out with a Wind Wisp from Spintwitches and we'll call it even.",
  "MidResMaleB_11016": "Have you ever noticed in Potions that the girl who sits in the corner almost always nearly melts her cauldron? I find it quite disconcerting and Sharp doesn't even raise an eyebrow. Yet I drop one nettle too many and I get the stare of the Basilisk.",
  "MidResMaleB_11017": "I'd swear we'd be more uplifted in Potions if it were taught by Dementors.",
  "MidResMaleB_11018": "Do you find it hard to get the right consistency in a Confusing Concoction? I can never get mine to thicken.",
  "MidResMaleB_11019": "It was perfect for stargazing the other night; not a cloud in the sky. I've never seen the heavens so clear. Do you think that's a bad omen?",
  "MidResMaleB_11020": "Do you think if we asked Shah, she'd let us go up earlier to the Astronomy Tower? I bet she would; she lives for it.",
  "MidResMaleB_11021": "I was only looking up a reference for Garlick and I found a fascinating book on self-fertilising shrubs.",
  "MidResMaleB_11022": "You could drop me in the middle of Rookwood's Sunday dinner and I'd stare him straight in the eyes and ask for gravy.",
  "MidResMaleB_11023": "Why are you looking at me like that? Yes, I do think Sirona's very nice. What of it?",
  "MidResMaleB_11024": "Much more fun than the common room and no one tells you off if you spill something.",
  "MidResMaleB_11028": "Mind you, if you leave your shoes under your bed I suppose that can cause a bit of a whiff too.",
  "MidResMaleB_11029": "Think no one's noticing them squeezed at the same desk. What? Of course I don't care.",
  "MidResMaleB_11030": "It's as if I'm drowning in a lecture from Binns.",
  "MidResMaleB_11031": "Must have been a ghost.",
  "MidResMaleB_11032": "Likely Peeves playing tricks again – I hope.",
  "MidResMaleB_11033": "Caught you sneaking about, didn't I?",
  "MidResMaleB_11034": "Spying on the professors, are we?",
  "MidResMaleB_11035": "The Faculty Tower is off limits to students.",
  "MidResMaleB_11036": "If I catch a student in here, punitive measures will be taken.",
  "MidResMaleB_11038": "I heard that Professor Binns died one night and showed up to class the next morning as if nothing had happened. I don't think he even knows he's a ghost.",
  "MidResMaleB_11039": "As a Muggle-born, I used to feel I had a lot of work to do if I wanted to catch up to the other students. Now I realise that no particular group of wizards has the monopoly on skill.",
  "MidResMaleB_11040": "I like sitting around the fire in the common room after a long day. Especially if we've had Potions. Much cosier than the Great Hall.",
  "MidResMaleB_11041": "I'd imagine the Hufflepuff common room smells the most delicious on account of it being so close to the kitchens.",
  "MidResMaleB_11042": "I don't mind living in dormitories – no parents around nagging me to pick up my robes.",
  "MidResMaleB_11043": "I've taken to studying during the day in our dormitory. No one's there and I can practise my casts to my heart's content.",
  "MidResMaleB_11044": "I was trapped on the Grand Staircase once. Every time I tried to step off, it moved again. Still haven't lived that down.",
  "MidResMaleB_11045": "I dropped one of the crystal balls in Divination. Shattered everywhere. I was mortified. I will say that Professor Onai seemed much calmer than I expected. Still, not ideal.",
  "MidResMaleB_11046": "Can you eat a Chinese Chomping Cabbage? Not that I'm going to find out, mind you.",
  "MidResMaleB_11047": "Can't seem to get the smell of dragon dung out of my robes after that last Herbology class. Suppose it's better than Stinksap. But not by much.",
  "MidResMaleB_11048": "I prefer the Three Broomsticks to the Hog's Head. Sirona's a much better conversationalist than Jasper Trout.",
  "MidResMaleB_11049": "Yes, Professor Binns does drone on a bit. But have you ever got him really talking about goblin rebellions? Knows everything. Still boring. But impressive.",
  "MidResMaleB_11050": "Ronen certainly employs creative teaching methods. While I don’t always enjoy his games, I can admire the enthusiasm.",
  "MidResMaleB_11051": "My family has a Gobstones tournament every year. Bit chaotic but loads of fun.",
  "MidResMaleB_11052": "My little sisters will be so happy to see me over the holidays. They madly try to cast 'spells' at me with their toy wands.  Mildly annoying.",
  "MidResMaleB_11053": "My mother is so excited for me to come home for the holidays, she's written to me nearly every day. The family owl's exhausted.",
  "MidResMaleB_11054": "Why would Slytherin put his common room in the dungeons? So dreary. Perhaps that’s the point.",
  "MidResMaleB_11055": "Rumour has it there's a secret passage leading to Hogsmeade, but I haven't found it. Probably for the best. I'd be at the Three Broomsticks all day.",
  "MidResMaleB_11056": "Wish I could sneak into the other common rooms. Just for an hour or so.",
  "MidResMaleB_11057": "It must be difficult to live in those remote hamlets with the Ashwinders running about.",
  "MidResMaleB_11058": "Rumour has it there's an abandoned manor near Bàgh an Taigh. No one knows what happened to the family. Think I'll stay close to the castle.",
  "MidResMaleB_11059": "Is Lower Hogsfield still dealing with that nasty goblin? Can't have been good for business.",
  "MidResMaleB_11060": "I don't like flying on a broom. I prefer the safety of a Thestral-drawn carriage. Nothing wrong with that.",
  "MidResMaleB_11061": "Broomsticks are going out of style, I think. So many other ways to travel now.",
  "MidResMaleB_11062": "How in the world did people ride broomsticks before the invention of the Cushioning Charm?",
  "MidResMaleB_11063": "I wonder why Madam Kogawa didn't become a professional Quidditch player. What if she's not actually that good?",
  "MidResMaleB_11064": "I want to play Quidditch professionally when I'm older. I'd make a marvellous Chaser.",
  "MidResMaleB_11065": "Does Professor Black have children of his own? Poor things, if he does.",
  "MidResMaleB_11066": "Do you suppose Black's children are as condescending and ill-tempered as he is?",
  "MidResMaleB_11067": "The Headmaster hates everyone who isn't a pure-blood Slytherin.",
  "MidResMaleB_11068": "My little brother sends me letters chock full of questions about Hogwarts. Merlin help us when he starts here next year.",
  "MidResMaleB_11069": "Have you ever wondered how owls know where to deliver their letters? Magic, I suppose.",
  "MidResMaleB_11070": "I need to stop by the owlery. Far too long since I've sent a letter home.",
  "MidResMaleB_11071": "It's a good thing the owlery is away from the rest of the school. Quite the aroma in there.",
  "MidResMaleB_11072": "Human Transfiguration is dangerous. Charlotte Morrison had to go to the hospital wing last year. Got stuck with fox ears. Improvement, I thought.",
  "MidResMaleB_11073": "I wonder what animal I'd be if I was an Animagus. Wouldn't mind being a cat. Or an Erumpent.",
  "MidResMaleB_11074": "Arthur Siggs tried conjuring a pillow the other day. Ended up with a hedgehog. Not terribly comfortable to sleep on, I’d imagine.",
  "MidResMaleB_11075": "Transfiguration has always come easily to me. I suppose some minds are more suited to it than others.",
  "MidResMaleB_11076": "She's worse than my cat.",
  "MidResMaleB_11077": "Arthur's always got some intriguing project or another going on. I can barely follow Divination homework, let alone a treasure map.",
  "MidResMaleB_11086": "I'd take to the skies too if I didn't have such a fear of heights.",
  "MidResMaleB_11087": "That's a majestic manner of travel.",
  "MidResMaleB_11088": "It seems you've got quite comfortable here.",
  "MidResMaleB_11089": "I know that Fig teaches Magical Theory – but, theoretically, does anyone take it?",
  "MidResMaleB_11090": "Poor Professor Fig. I didn't know him well but he always greeted me kindly in the halls.",
  "MidResMaleB_11091": "Think I'll steer clear of Hogsmeade for a bit. Not fond of trolls.",
  "MidResMaleB_11092": "Ranrok's Loyalists never stood a chance. Wasn't worried for an instant.",
  "MidResMaleB_11093": "I heard you did quite well in Brattleby's duelling club.",
  "MidResMaleB_11094": "Well done putting Imelda in her place. And in her own time trials, no less!",
  "MidResMaleB_11095": "I don't think even Professor Ronen expected anyone to be so good at Summoner's Court.",
  "MidResMaleB_11096": "I've heard Natty talk about Uagadou. Sounds like a fascinating place.",
  "MidResMaleB_11097": "Poppy's really got a way with beasts, doesn’t she?",
  "MidResMaleB_11098": "I like Sebastian – but I always feel as if his mind is somewhere else.",
  "MidResMaleB_11099": "I'm always astonished at how much Amit knows about a variety of things. Well-read, that one.",
  "MidResMaleB_11100": "Imelda doesn't usually make – uh – friends.",
  "MidResMaleB_11101": "I hear you've become friends – or should I say 'accomplices' – with Everett. I'll be wary of you two.",
  "MidResMaleB_11102": "You really showed that troll what's what, didn't you?",
  "MidResMaleB_11103": "I think even Sirona's patience is tested by having Ferdinand's portrait back at the Three Broomsticks.",
  "MidResMaleB_11104": "Perhaps I'll go to the Hog's Head. Throw something at Ferdinand in his new location – thanks to you.",
  "MidResMaleB_11105": "The Three Broomsticks is so much more pleasant without Ferdinand.",
  "MidResMaleB_11106": "I wouldn't let people see you practising such magic. Not everyone would be as understanding.",
  "MidResMaleB_11107": "Perhaps it's locked for a reason?",
  "MidResMaleB_11109": "I don't know how you did what you did to save Hogwarts, but I'm awfully glad you did it.",
  "MidResMaleB_11110": "Never thought I'd witness Sebastian lose a duel.",
  "MidResMaleB_11111": "Lovely to have the bells back in the music room.",
  "MidResMaleB_11112": "Don't mind me.",
  "MidResMaleB_11113": "A little vandalism always does wonders for my mood.",

  "MidResMaleC_10092": "You're looking well, as usual.",
  "MidResMaleC_10093": "Hello, my dear friend.",
  "MidResMaleC_10094": "How goes it?",
  "MidResMaleC_10095": "Hello there.",
  "MidResMaleC_10096": "Greetings.",
  "MidResMaleC_10097": "Mmm.",
  "MidResMaleC_10098": "Hello.",
  "MidResMaleC_10137": "I bet Durmstrang students don't have to put up this this kind of stupidity.",
  "MidResMaleC_10138": "Haven't we enough chaos without Peeves?",
  "MidResMaleC_10139": "Appalling behaviour.",
  "MidResMaleC_10140": "It you singe my robes, Peeves –",
  "MidResMaleC_10141": "(laughter)",
  "MidResMaleC_10142": "Pleasant bit of magic, isn't it?",
  "MidResMaleC_10143": "I wonder how it all works.",
  "MidResMaleC_10150": "Goodness. It's the Headmaster.",
  "MidResMaleC_10151": "Watch yourself. It's the Headmaster.",
  "MidResMaleC_10160": "Don't press your luck.",
  "MidResMaleC_10161": "Useless aim.",
  "MidResMaleC_10164": "You think this is funny?",
  "MidResMaleC_10165": "Perhaps you might set me down, moonmind!",
  "MidResMaleC_10166": "Put me out!",
  "MidResMaleC_10167": "Argh! My clothes!",
  "MidResMaleC_10168": "My lips – won't – move.",
  "MidResMaleC_10169": "This is not good for my constitution.",
  "MidResMaleC_10172": "A bit sharp, isn't it?",
  "MidResMaleC_10173": "You like that?",
  "MidResMaleC_10174": "Ha. I'll do it again.",
  "MidResMaleC_10176": "Barely felt a thing.",
  "MidResMaleC_10177": "You call that an attack?",
  "MidResMaleC_10178": "A mere tickle.",
  "MidResMaleC_10183": "Nice use of foliage.",
  "MidResMaleC_10184": "Keep your plants off me!",
  "MidResMaleC_10187": "My ears!",
  "MidResMaleC_10188": "I can't take it anymore.",
  "MidResMaleC_10198": "I've pulled weeds bigger than you.",
  "MidResMaleC_10199": "Charming.",
  "MidResMaleC_10200": "Why, you cheeky little charmgrinder.",
  "MidResMaleC_10201": "I'm all right. In your own time.",
  "MidResMaleC_10202": "Would you mind putting me back down.",
  "MidResMaleC_10203": "What's – happening?",
  "MidResMaleC_10204": "Oh, noooo!",
  "MidResMaleC_10205": "Professor Garlick would not approve of this.",
  "MidResMaleC_10206": "Next time it shrieks I shall bake the thing.",
  "MidResMaleC_10207": "Ugh. It's the choir of death.",
  "MidResMaleC_10222": "Not bad.",
  "MidResMaleC_10223": "I'd take over walking any day.",
  "MidResMaleC_10225": "Isn't a broom good enough?",
  "MidResMaleC_10226": "'Oh, I'm just out and about. Riding a Graphorn.'",
  "MidResMaleC_10227": "Mind that it doesn't drop you.",
  "MidResMaleC_10228": "Riding a Hippogriff's all well and good till it throws you.",
  "MidResMaleC_10229": "Archie Bickle's in fine fettle, thanks to you.",
  "MidResMaleC_10230": "You showed Rookwood, didn't you? – got that Hippogriff free!",
  "MidResMaleC_10231": "Rabe's out of Rookwood hands, thanks to you.",
  "MidResMaleC_10232": "The Dementors can have Rookwood now. Well done.",
  "MidResMaleC_10234": "When is Sebastian going to learn to stay away from the Restricted Section? He deserves detention.",
  "MidResMaleC_10235": "Anne Sallow hasn't been to school in ages, poor girl.",
  "MidResMaleC_10236": "Striking up a friendship with Gaunt, are we?",
  "MidResMaleC_10253": "Nice of you to dress up.",
  "MidResMaleC_10254": "So, I know the race 'never happened', but – nice one.",
  "MidResMaleC_10275": "Why would you want to spend so much time with Fig? Do you feel sorry for him?",
  "MidResMaleC_10276": "Professor Fig was a good teacher. Though I'm not quite sure what he taught.",
  "MidResMaleC_10279": "No goblin army could ever tear these walls down.",
  "MidResMaleC_10284": "(hurrahs)",
  "MidResMaleC_10285": "(celebratory cheers)",
  "MidResMaleC_10761": "You make it so tempting. How many times have we done this now?",
  "MidResMaleC_10762": "Too many to count? You really need to keep your guard up.",
  "MidResMaleC_10763": "Well, only one way to learn: experience!",
  "MidResMaleC_10803": "What are you doing, are you mad?",
  "MidResMaleC_10805": "I wonder where they're from?",
  "MidResMaleC_10816": "Nothing, yet.",
  "MidResMaleC_10817": "What do you think mermaids look like?",
  "MidResMaleC_10818": "I really hope we get to see or at least hear one today.",
  "MidResMaleC_10819": "Do you think they're hiding from us?",
  "MidResMaleC_10822": "Urgh. There goes my wager.",
  "MidResMaleC_10823": "That reminds me, did Scribner say we could borrow the book overnight, or that we'd get detention if we had it out overnight?",
  "MidResMaleC_10824": "I'm still struggling with antidotes. Startling to me that so many of them use Mandrakes. I'll be sure never to go into that line of work.",
  "MidResMaleC_10825": "It all baffles me. Take Moonstone: whoever came up with using Moonstone in a potion?",
  "MidResMaleC_10826": "Obviously Hogwarts is the best wizarding school in the world. Everybody knows that. Of course we're going to be the best at magic.",
  "MidResMaleC_10827": "The people I feel sorry for are the ones who don't receive any owls, poor things. Have you seen their little faces at the table?",
  "MidResMaleC_10828": "If anyone needs help with an essay or assignment, I don't mind lending a hand. I wrote two inches for Binns yesterday while I was eating my lunch.",
  "MidResMaleC_10829": "My great-aunt was a Hufflepuff. She says it's the best common room on account of it being so quiet; compared to the others, I mean.",
  "MidResMaleC_10830": "People are always fussing about in my common room. Someone was trying to come up with some sort of pepper hex the other day.",
  "MidResMaleC_10831": "That poor first-year trying to get into the Gryffindor common room. I swear the Fat Lady was having them on. Poor thing had to wait till next day.",
  "MidResMaleC_10832": "My father said he used to hide his schoolwork under his bed.",
  "MidResMaleC_10833": "I like to keep a bit of Wiggenweld Potion under my bed. Not naming names, but someone's bought a few too many tricks from Zonko's.",
  "MidResMaleC_10834": "I'd been collecting Chizpurfle fangs the entire term. Then I thought I'd be clever and simply keep a few Chizpurfles.",
  "MidResMaleC_10835": "Try working with a wand that's been passed down from three unruly sisters.",
  "MidResMaleC_10836": "I'm uncomfortable with the size of my legs. Well, you were asking the other day so I'm telling you.",
  "MidResMaleC_10837": "Well, my father naturally assumed I'd be a strong Seeker, just like him. I say, thank Merlin Quidditch was cancelled.",
  "MidResMaleC_10838": "I took my copy of One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi to Herbology and I left it in the greenhouse, by the Mandrake seedlings. Sharp was horrified I didn't have it for his class. Said I need to get my priorities straight.",
  "MidResMaleC_10839": "Why won't she just let us use Gillyweed? What's the point of even learning about Herbology if we can't get ourselves into some trouble with Gillyweed? If I haven't personally met a mermaid by the end of term, I can tell you, I shan't be happy.",
  "MidResMaleC_10840": "Any of you know where I can find some Leaping Toadstools?",
  "MidResMaleC_10841": "Did you get your Bitterroot from Pippin's? Or did you pick it yourself? I'm desperately in need of some.",
  "MidResMaleC_10842": "Parry Pippin certainly steered me right with that Wound-Cleaning Potion. His potion shop's better than you'd find in London, I reckon.",
  "MidResMaleC_10843": "I find if I try to look attentive in Potions it seems to keep Sharp off my back. It works quite well. Unless he asks me a question and then it's not really a good plan at all. Overall I probably wouldn't recommend it.",
  "MidResMaleC_10844": "I heard some chatter near the girls' lavatory about Boomslang skin. Do you think they're looking to brew a Polyjuice Potion? Oh, what if they already brewed one and Sharp's actually that Hufflepuff girl with the long arms?",
  "MidResMaleC_10845": "I suppose I'd be curious about a Beautification Potion. What? Not for me, moonmind. For a friend of mine. Don't be stupid.",
  "MidResMaleC_10846": "You should hear Shah talking about Divination.  It's a wonder Onai's ears don't catch alight. What's to say stars know more than cards, I say.",
  "MidResMaleC_10847": "I don't mind saying that I find it hard to comprehend that Black has a wife. What sort of witch would take that man's hand in marriage? I suppose, on the other hand, it means there's hope for us lot.",
  "MidResMaleC_10848": "How do you look at a rock and say, 'Oh, I think I'll drink that.'?",
  "MidResMaleC_10849": "Those French don't even hold their wands right so I don't know what they're teaching at Beauxbatons.",
  "MidResMaleC_10850": "Almost makes you want to send them one just to give them a thrill. Me? I'm dripping with owls.",
  "MidResMaleC_10851": "Where's the brain? Couldn't stop sneezing for hours.",
  "MidResMaleC_10853": "(frustrated groans)",
  "MidResMaleC_10854": "You must know more about Hogwarts than Professor Binns.",
  "MidResMaleC_10856": "I'd imagine Howin's impressed with your beasts talents.",
  "MidResMaleC_10859": "Is there anywhere in Hogwarts you haven't explored?",
  "MidResMaleC_10860": "I thought I was a good duellist, but I wouldn't dare cross you.",
  "MidResMaleC_10861": "Professor Shah must be well impressed with your dedication to those Astronomy Tables.",
  "MidResMaleC_10862": "I've never won a broom race in my life.",
  "MidResMaleC_10863": "Remind me to never challenge you to an <i>Accio</i> Ball competition.",
  "MidResMaleC_10864": "You and Natty are quite close, aren't you?",
  "MidResMaleC_10865": "You seem to have taken an interest in Poppy.",
  "MidResMaleC_10866": "I hope you're keeping Sebastian out of trouble.",
  "MidResMaleC_10867": "I'm glad Amit has a friend like you.",
  "MidResMaleC_10868": "You've certainly been spending a lot of time with Imelda.",
  "MidResMaleC_10869": "Everett is a fine friend to have.",
  "MidResMaleC_10871": "Very brave of you to fight for Hogwarts.",
  "MidResMaleC_10872": "I heard you got caught up in the Hogsmeade attack.",
  "MidResMaleC_10876": "Congratulations on your House Cup win!",
  "MidResMaleC_10880": "Duncan owes his reputation to you.",
  "MidResMaleC_10881": "Once a coward, always a coward. Just ask Duncan Hobhouse.",
  "MidResMaleC_10896": "I'd stay away from the music room; unless you want to be driven mad by the sound of bells.",
  "MidResMaleC_10906": "You didn't have to bring Ferdinand back to the pub.",
  "MidResMaleC_10907": "Oh, wonderful. Ferdinand's back.",
  "MidResMaleC_10908": "I never go to the Hog's Head, so I'm glad Ferdinand's there now.",
  "MidResMaleC_10909": "Now that Ferdinand's at the Hog's Head I have even less reason to go there.",
  "MidResMaleC_10910": "Ferdinand was so annoying – he deserved to have his portrait destroyed.",
  "MidResMaleC_10911": "Well, I suppose we won't have to listen to Ferdinand anymore.",
  "MidResMaleC_10914": "It was brilliant how you defeated Sallow in that duel.",
  "MidResMaleC_10915": "It was brilliant how you defeated Sallow in that duel.",
  "MidResMaleC_10916": "Where did you and Poppy run off to?",
  "MidResMaleC_10917": "Where did you and Poppy run off to?",
  "MidResMaleC_10920": "'What's the harm?' I thought. Ooh, you've never a had a night's sleep like I had when they all ran amok in my bed.",
  "MidResMaleC_10921": "Almost got me expelled, that did.",
  "MidResMaleC_10922": "Said there was always some student or another in his house who'd want to be copying it.",
  "MidResMaleC_10923": "I feel like it'd serve me better planted in a pot.",
  "MidResMaleC_10924": "They swell sometimes. My father used to say that I looked part Erumpent. It's not funny.",
  "MidResMaleC_10926": "Ohh!",
  "MidResMaleC_10927": "If I Transfigure my poor toad into a goblet one more time, I think he's going to insist he stay that way.",
  "MidResMaleC_10928": "Professor Howin's going to quiz us on rare water beasts next week. Can't wait to tell her I actually saw a Kelpie in Ireland over the summer.",
  "MidResMaleC_10929": "Don't know why the common rooms all have secret ways of entering. Who wants to go into someone else's common room anyway? We were sorted for a reason.",
  "MidResMaleC_10930": "Someone's parent sent homemade Cauldron Cakes and they shared them in the common room. Think they mistook salt for sugar, mind you. Half-eaten cakes everywhere for days, there were.",
  "MidResMaleC_10931": "Our dorm's atrocious. I do wish people would clean up after themselves once in a while. A Bundimun destroyed my homework last night. And it was Potions.",
  "MidResMaleC_10932": "My side of the dormitory is always spotless. Can't say the same for my housemates. If I didn't know better, I'd say they were raised by trolls.",
  "MidResMaleC_10933": "I was distracted by Peeves and ran face-first into Adelaide Oakes the other day. Our books went flying. Think it made Peeves' entire week.",
  "MidResMaleC_10934": "Sharp caught me making faces behind his back. It was awful – not to mention losing so many house points.",
  "MidResMaleC_10935": "I need to get some dragon-hide gloves for Herbology. I refuse to handle Chinese Chomping Cabbages with bare hands.",
  "MidResMaleC_10936": "Going to harvest some knotgrass from the greenhouses today. Did you know that it's used in Polyjuice Potion? Think it has something to do with being 'tied' to another person.",
  "MidResMaleC_10937": "I'd like to open a shop in Hogsmeade myself one day. Gladrags could do with some competition.",
  "MidResMaleC_10938": "Wonder how Sharp injured his leg. I'd wager it was something to do with his time as an Auror.",
  "MidResMaleC_10939": "Everyone seems to fear Professor Sharp. Not me. I think the man's brilliant. Only barked at me twice this week for singeing my robes.",
  "MidResMaleC_10940": "This is my sister's first year at Hogwarts. Every time she pretends not to see me in the halls, I cast at her with a Trip Jinx.",
  "MidResMaleC_10941": "This is the first year my siblings and I are all at Hogwarts together. Our poor mother doesn't know what to do with her time, so she knits. Sends us each a new jumper every week.",
  "MidResMaleC_10942": "I hadn't met any of my cousins until I came to Hogwarts and found out we were sorted into the same house.",
  "MidResMaleC_10943": "I was trapped on the Grand Staircase for an hour the other day waiting for it to move. Sharp didn’t believe me when I told him why I was late.",
  "MidResMaleC_10944": "My friends and I like to spend our evenings watching the sun set from the Quidditch pitch. That’s all the pitch is good for this year, sadly.",
  "MidResMaleC_10945": "Have you been to the Owlery lately? House-elves have fallen a bit behind in the cleaning this week.",
  "MidResMaleC_10946": "I heard an ex-Auror lives in a hamlet outside of Hogsmeade. Think I'd want a quiet life too after years fighting Dark Wizards.",
  "MidResMaleC_10947": "I'd like to retire to Hogsmeade one day. Open a pub. Bore future Hogwarts pupils with tales of my childhood.",
  "MidResMaleC_10948": "Any news about the dragon near Pitt-Upon-Ford? Be enough to make me move, to be honest.",
  "MidResMaleC_10949": "I met some of my best friends in Flying. Nothing creates a bond like thinking you're all about to die.",
  "MidResMaleC_10950": "My brother promised me his old broomstick once he's saved up for a new one. I can't wait.",
  "MidResMaleC_10951": "I practised doing a loop-the-loop on my broom all summer. What a waste of time.",
  "MidResMaleC_10952": "I miss going to matches. Cheering everyone on was magnificent fun. And getting to see Isaac Cooper. ",
  "MidResMaleC_10953": "The Chudley Cannons are going to be unbeatable next season; you just wait and see.",
  "MidResMaleC_10954": "It's good Black's children are too young to attend Hogwarts. I'd hate it if my father was Headmaster.",
  "MidResMaleC_10955": "Professor Weasley must be exhausted doing her job as well as the Headmaster's. We’re lucky to have her.",
  "MidResMaleC_10956": "Professor Black glanced at me the other day in the Great Hall. I spit out my breakfast. Not sure it sent the right message.",
  "MidResMaleC_10957": "I used to write to my parents every week. Now I can't remember the last time I sent them an owl. Wonder if they know I'm still alive.",
  "MidResMaleC_10958": "Wish I'd brought a pet owl to school. Don't misunderstand, I adore my toad. At least somewhat. Don't suppose you want a toad.",
  "MidResMaleC_10959": "Do all of the professors have their own owls? I imagine they must send a lot of letters. Likely to the Ministry.",
  "MidResMaleC_10960": "So many letters arrive every day and none of them is ever for me.",
  "MidResMaleC_10961": "I rather enjoy Transfiguration myself. The complexity – the precise nature of it; truly something to be admired.",
  "MidResMaleC_10962": "Professor Weasley is a marvellous teacher. Never requires us to write more inches of parchment on a topic than necessary.",
  "MidResMaleC_10963": "If I can just stop vanishing my notes when practising <i>Evanesco</i>, I think I can get an O on my Transfiguration O.W.L. this year.",
  "MidResMaleC_10964": "Professor Weasley's already preparing me to take my Transfiguration N.E.W.T.",
  "MidResMaleC_10966": "Well if it isn't Puffskein Dunkein.",
  "MidResMaleC_10967": "Those were hidden away for a reason.",
  "MidResMaleC_10968": "I hear Plummly found some old maps lying about. Thinks there's treasure at Hogwarts.",
  "MidResMaleC_10975": "These time trials are as exciting as Imelda said.",
  "MidResMaleC_10980": "My father always said I may have to stand up to a troll one day. I never could though.",
  "MidResMaleC_10981": "I used to keep a goblin artefact in my room at home. I shall be taking that down after what Ranrok and his lot have done. Awful.",
  "MidResMaleC_10982": "Wish I had your skill. I'm like a drowned Billywig at Crossed Wands, I am.",
  "MidResMaleC_10983": "Just curious, were you born with a broom? Bet Imelda's livid.",
  "MidResMaleC_10984": "Very good form you had, at Summoner's Court. Wish I was half as good.",
  "MidResMaleC_10985": "I'd spend more time with Natty myself, except I'm a bit afraid of her mother.",
  "MidResMaleC_10986": "We'll have to get you a pen, the amount of time you're spending with Poppy. Put you in with the Kneazles.",
  "MidResMaleC_10987": "He's a dark horse, Sebastian. Always feel like he's hiding something. I'd watch out if I were you.",
  "MidResMaleC_10988": "Glad you've found yourself a good pal. Nice chap, Amit. Always liked him.",
  "MidResMaleC_10989": "Bet you're picking up all sorts of flying tips from Imelda. Lucky thing.",
  "MidResMaleC_10990": "Mind you don't get into too much trouble with Everett. Expulsion seems to hold no fear with that lad.",
  "MidResMaleC_10991": "I hope you're around if trolls ever come about me.",
  "MidResMaleC_10992": "You're the one who hung Ferdy back at the Three Broomsticks, aren't you? Probably a good thing or we'd never hear the end of it.",
  "MidResMaleC_10993": "You put Ferdy at the Hog's Head, didn't you? Must be his worst nightmare!",
  "MidResMaleC_10994": "Ha, you're the one who's left Ferdy without a holiday home! Or frame, I should say. Poor chap must be livid.",
  "MidResMaleC_10995": "Oh, you shouldn't be using that sort of magic. You'll get into a lot of trouble for that.",
  "MidResMaleC_10996": "Oh. I hope you're around next time I lose the key to my trunk.",
  "MidResMaleC_10998": "I can hardly sleep now, thinking what would have become of this school without you. Brave one, you are.",
  "MidResMaleC_10999": "My father would be so impressed if it was me that had beat Sebastian in that duel. Nice one.",
  "MidResMaleC_11000": "Oh, don't do that. That's not necessary.",
  "MidResMaleC_11001": "Ha, heard the bells ringing again. Black must be up in arms; remind him of his wedding day, apparently.",
  "MidResMaleC_11002": "Oh. Don't mind me. I see that you don't.",

  "MidResMaleD_10117": "Haven't seen your face in a while.",
  "MidResMaleD_10118": "Hello – how have you been?",
  "MidResMaleD_10123": "Greetings.",
  "MidResMaleD_10124": "Hogwarts is a fine school, don't you think?",
  "MidResMaleD_10125": "Studying hard?",
  "MidResMaleD_10126": "Hello there.",
  "MidResMaleD_10127": "Having a pleasant time at school?",
  "MidResMaleD_10360": "Don't make me have to get a prefect.",
  "MidResMaleD_10618": "Well done!",
  "MidResMaleD_10619": "Too many to count.",
  "MidResMaleD_10620": "Or – I've an idea – learn the counter-curse.",
  "MidResMaleD_10621": "Haha! Experience!",
  "MidResMaleD_10742": "Argh!",
  "MidResMaleD_10743": "Ugh, you miserable – urgh! Gave me the fright of my life, you did!",
  "MidResMaleD_10744": "Someone ought to haunt him for a change.",
  "MidResMaleD_10774": "I wish I could thank whoever's behind Ferdinand's misfortune.",
  "MidResMaleD_10775": "Do not make eye contact with the Headmaster.",
  "MidResMaleD_10776": "Why's the Headmaster rushing about?",
  "MidResMaleD_10785": "Close one.",
  "MidResMaleD_10786": "A near hit.",
  "MidResMaleD_10789": "I prefer the ground.",
  "MidResMaleD_10790": "Are you enjoying yourself?",
  "MidResMaleD_10791": "Blazes!",
  "MidResMaleD_10792": "You'll turn me to ashes!",
  "MidResMaleD_10793": "Don't suppose I could get – a cup of tea?",
  "MidResMaleD_10794": "Ice – I'm like ice.",
  "MidResMaleD_10797": "There. See how you like that.",
  "MidResMaleD_10798": "Oooh, you'll want a bandage for that.",
  "MidResMaleD_10799": "Bet that'll be sore.",
  "MidResMaleD_10801": "Pfft. Just a scratch.",
  "MidResMaleD_10802": "Just a sting.",
  "MidResMaleD_10803": "I'll have no more of that.",
  "MidResMaleD_10808": "Wouldn't something less 'leafy' have been better?",
  "MidResMaleD_10809": "Mind your lettuce!",
  "MidResMaleD_10812": "Put it away!",
  "MidResMaleD_10813": "Put it in the pot!",
  "MidResMaleD_10822": "I'll soon prune you!",
  "MidResMaleD_10824": "That's mine if you don't mind.",
  "MidResMaleD_10825": "Excuse me.",
  "MidResMaleD_10826": "You've had your fun, now put me down.",
  "MidResMaleD_10827": " I have better things to do if you don't mind.",
  "MidResMaleD_10828": "This is – not – very nice!",
  "MidResMaleD_10829": "What are you – doing?",
  "MidResMaleD_10830": "What a horrid plant.",
  "MidResMaleD_10831": "Oh, Merlin's nose hair, I thought I'd go deaf.",
  "MidResMaleD_10832": "What?  I can't hear.",
  "MidResMaleD_10844": "Safe flying.",
  "MidResMaleD_10845": "Mind where you're going.",
  "MidResMaleD_10847": "Did I just see what I think I saw?",
  "MidResMaleD_10848": "See that you don't trample anyone I know.",
  "MidResMaleD_10849": "I didn't know we were allowed to ride Hippogriffs.",
  "MidResMaleD_10850": "What a brilliant way to fly around.",
  "MidResMaleD_10851": "Well done, rescuing Archie and all.",
  "MidResMaleD_10852": "I see that kidnapped Hippogriff's flying free again, thanks to you.",
  "MidResMaleD_10853": "That was very brave of you, rescuing Isko.",
  "MidResMaleD_10854": "I heard what you did to old Rookwood. Good riddance, I say.",
  "MidResMaleD_10856": "Awful luck about Sebastian; detention for sneaking into the Restricted Section again.",
  "MidResMaleD_10857": "Poor Anne Sallow. I wonder when we'll see her at school again.",
  "MidResMaleD_10858": "I see you've been chumming about with Ominis Gaunt.",
  "MidResMaleD_10875": "Dressed for the ball, I see.",
  "MidResMaleD_10876": "I thought Imelda was unbeatable on a broom until you showed up.",
  "MidResMaleD_10897": "Are you doing some sort of extracurricular work for Fig?",
  "MidResMaleD_10898": "I'm sorry about Professor Fig. I know you two were really close.",
  "MidResMaleD_10901": "Goblins will pay for what they did to our school.",
  "MidResMaleD_10906": "(celebratory cheers)",
  "MidResMaleD_10907": "That poltergeist is an absolute menace.",
  "MidResMaleD_10908": "Couldn't he throw something a little softer?",
  "MidResMaleD_10909": "I just brushed my hair.",
  "MidResMaleD_10917": "(laughter)",
  "MidResMaleD_10918": "Can't imagine starting a new school this late.",
  "MidResMaleD_10922": "Get him Arthur.",
  "MidResMaleD_11059": "I ought to find one of those old maps. Might be fun.",
  "MidResMaleD_11060": " Look at Nellie!",
  "MidResMaleD_11061": "She's not afraid of anything.",
  "MidResMaleD_11062": "I can't believe she's doing that.",
  "MidResMaleD_11063": "You wouldn't catch me doing that. ",
  "MidResMaleD_11066": "Come on!",
  "MidResMaleD_11067": "I bet all the answers to everything are in the Restricted Section. I think it should be a special treat in year five that you get to go into it.",
  "MidResMaleD_11068": "Do you think they'd actually bring in a Dementor? For Defence Against the Dark Arts? What better way to learn, I say.",
  "MidResMaleD_11069": "If we were simply taught antidotes to common poisons I truly think that would be enough to get us through life.",
  "MidResMaleD_11070": "Do you ever wish you could ride a Hippogriff? I've ridden one of course. Several, in fact. I just wondered if you – knew what it was like?",
  "MidResMaleD_11071": "My uncle knows Kogawa so I can't imagine I won't get good marks. And my aunt knows Black's wife so all in all I'd say I'm well set.",
  "MidResMaleD_11072": "Last week I performed a Knee-reversal hex on a second-year. It was an utter triumph.",
  "MidResMaleD_11073": "My older sister came here. Said she carved her initials into the fireplace of our common room but I think she made it up.",
  "MidResMaleD_11074": "I tried to hide a Puffskein once. In the corner of the common room.",
  "MidResMaleD_11075": "While I remember, don't forget to give me that book on ancient runes. Or, in case I don't see you –",
  "MidResMaleD_11076": "Every time I'm there, everyone falls asleep. I don't think that's what a common room is for.",
  "MidResMaleD_11077": "I wish they'd allow us our pets from home. We have a Crup called Mange.",
  "MidResMaleD_11078": "I haven't slept well for ages. I miss my pillow from home. What? Nothing wrong with that?",
  "MidResMaleD_11079": "We have the most annoying of all the prefects, I swear.",
  "MidResMaleD_11080": "Ugh, I was always in trouble, I was. Always something broken in the garden. Ornaments, torn-up lawn.",
  "MidResMaleD_11081": "We had a ghoul in our attic. Groaned all the time; quite the nuisance. Still, we never had spiders.",
  "MidResMaleD_11082": "I've been meaning to ask you, you wouldn't have an extra quill I could borrow, would you?",
  "MidResMaleD_11083": "I'll trade you a spoon's worth of Flobberworm Mucus for a Puffapod.",
  "MidResMaleD_11084": "Where did you get your dragon-hide gloves? I saw you handling that Snargaluff in Herbology. You know my gloves went mysteriously missing?",
  "MidResMaleD_11085": "I wouldn't bother yourself about that. If I were you, I'd be more inclined to acquire myself some Bubotuber pus. I'm sure Garlick could point you in the right direction. Soon get that complexion in better fettle.",
  "MidResMaleD_11086": "If it's seeds I'm after, I'll always go to the Magic Neep. I've upset Madam Green one too many times now. She won't soon be welcoming me back to Dogweed and Deathcap.",
  "MidResMaleD_11088": "Why are we only learning all the boring potions? When are we learning Felix Felicis? Knowing Sharp, he'll probably teach it after we've done our exams.",
  "MidResMaleD_11089": "I don't find Potions bearable at all. And if it's double Potions, I question whether I wouldn't just rather be a Muggle.",
  "MidResMaleD_11091": "I wish they'd let Ronen teach the entire curriculum. Charms is the only class I can stay awake for.",
  "MidResMaleD_11092": "Sometimes I'm not fully sure if Ronen's teaching us a spell or having a practice himself. Don't you find? It's genuinely questionable as to whether the man's at Hogwarts to steer the next generation, or to become the next Uric the Oddball.",
  "MidResMaleD_11093": "She's not the type to carve initials. Except the Quidditch captain's apparently.",
  "MidResMaleD_11094": "Have someone leave it on the mantle in the common room. Don't forget.",
  "MidResMaleD_11095": "My cousin gave me a rune with a Fwooper on it and I want to know what it means.",
  "MidResMaleD_11096": "Could mean I'm destined for greatness. Likely that's it.",
  "MidResMaleD_11097": "Would have been fine if the prefect hadn't found it up their nose one morning.",
  "MidResMaleD_11098": "Didn't see the issue myself but they found it 'quite offensive'.",
  "MidResMaleD_11105": "(frustrated groans)",
  "MidResMaleD_11106": "Sleep with me every night, she would. Oh, don't look at me like that.",
  "MidResMaleD_11107": "I'm not afraid, if that's what you're thinking? I'll take you on right now. Go on. Where's your wand?",
  "MidResMaleD_11108": "It's a wonder they ever have time for actual school work, the amount of time they spend reporting us.",
  "MidResMaleD_11109": "And the worst of it was, the whole time it was a Knarl that'd accidentally come over in my aunt's suitcase from Canada.",
  "MidResMaleD_11110": "And do you think anyone believed me? I was only trying to feed the thing.",
  "MidResMaleD_11111": "I tried an experiment on mine. Nothing of note, but I can tell you –",
  "MidResMaleD_11112": "– if you go into the girl's lavatory, the scorch mark on the sink was nothing to do with me.",
  "MidResMaleD_11113": "(snickering)",
  "MidResMaleD_11116": "What's so fascinating about them?",
  "MidResMaleD_11119": "Perhaps one day I'll sign up for a round.",
  "MidResMaleD_11120": "I wish Hogwarts would teach us how to become Animagi. They do at Uagadou! I'd be a Niffler. Stock up on Galleons.",
  "MidResMaleD_11121": "Still have a bump on my head from Herbology last week. The cotton fell out of my ear during a Mandrake lesson. I came to with my head in an upturned plantpot.",
  "MidResMaleD_11122": "I try to imagine the great witches and wizards of the past who once sat in the same chairs as we now get to sit in in the common room. Most inspiring.",
  "MidResMaleD_11123": "Nothing worse than students practising jinxes on each other in the common room. Can't take a step for fear of having your legs turn to jelly.",
  "MidResMaleD_11124": "I tried doing homework in the dormitory last night but ended up falling asleep. Those beds are simply too comfortable.",
  "MidResMaleD_11125": "Not the best idea to start a study group with the boys from my dormitory. Now we never get a break from each other.",
  "MidResMaleD_11126": "Honestly, the way some of those Slytherins fawn all over Professor Black; it's embarrassing. Even he seems irritated by it. Then again, what isn't he irritated by.",
  "MidResMaleD_11127": "I fell asleep in Transfiguration once. Professor Weasley woke me up and I had drool all over my wand. Couldn't transfigure my way out of that.",
  "MidResMaleD_11128": "I can't wait until I'm a sixth-year – then I won't have to waste my time with Herbology anymore. I'll miss Professor Garlick, mind.",
  "MidResMaleD_11129": "My interest in Herbology stems solely from my desire to excel in potions. If you can't brew with it, don't grow it, I say.",
  "MidResMaleD_11130": "I'd spend the entire day in Hogsmeade if I could.",
  "MidResMaleD_11131": "Rumour is, Professor Hecat used to work for the Ministry. Wonder what she did.",
  "MidResMaleD_11132": "I'd die of embarrassment if my mother taught at Hogwarts. Don't know how Natty manages.",
  "MidResMaleD_11133": "My siblings and I have all been sorted into different houses. Came as no surprise to my father.",
  "MidResMaleD_11134": "Hogwarts has brought me and my siblings closer together. We've had to rely on each other without having our parents about.",
  "MidResMaleD_11135": "My older sisters taught me everything I needed to know about Hogwarts before I stepped foot in the castle – including how to sneak food from in the kitchens.",
  "MidResMaleD_11136": "Got a peek at the Prefects' bathroom last year. I’d miss class for a week to soak in that tub.",
  "MidResMaleD_11137": "Peeves was in a mood the other day. Tossed my quill right on Scribner's desk. Now I have detention for a week.",
  "MidResMaleD_11138": "Just when I think I've learnt how to get around the castle, a staircase moves and I'm lost again.",
  "MidResMaleD_11139": "Isn't Sebastian Sallow's family from Feldcroft? I would have expected him to be from somewhere more posh.",
  "MidResMaleD_11140": "Hogsmeade is the only all-wizarding village I've ever heard of.",
  "MidResMaleD_11141": "So many interesting people from all over the world come through Hogsmeade. You never know who you'll meet. Spotted a vampire from Romania last spring.",
  "MidResMaleD_11142": "Wish I could afford my own broom from Spintwitches.",
  "MidResMaleD_11143": "Spintwitches is my favourite. At least I get to see all the brooms, even if I can't afford one myself.",
  "MidResMaleD_11144": "I don't know what Madam Kogawa sees in Imelda Reyes – she's not that good at flying.",
  "MidResMaleD_11145": "I was destined to be a glorious Beater if Quidditch hadn't been cancelled this year. I was!",
  "MidResMaleD_11146": "I'd make a fine Keeper – with a bit more practice.",
  "MidResMaleD_11147": "It's about time Hogwarts put someone like Black in charge. Perhaps now we can stop all these disgusting Mudbloods from ruining the school.",
  "MidResMaleD_11148": "My parents were thrilled to hear that Black was being put in charge. Our families have been friends for centuries.",
  "MidResMaleD_11149": "If only Black had the power to choose the other professors too. Then we could get rid of Muggle-borns like Garlick.",
  "MidResMaleD_11150": "I sent a love letter to Imelda Reyes once, but I think she thought I was making fun of her because she's been rude to me ever since. When I said she was outspoken, I meant it as a compliment.",
  "MidResMaleD_11151": "No one sends me owls. Can't remember the last time I got one. Not even on my birthday.",
  "MidResMaleD_11152": "I almost bought an owl in Diagon Alley. Went with a cat instead. Odd- coloured eye and it quite appealed to me.",
  "MidResMaleD_11153": "I'd like to send owls – but I have no one to write to.",
  "MidResMaleD_11154": "I still can't manage to Transfigure a match into a needle without it catching on fire.",
  "MidResMaleD_11155": "I asked Amit Thakkar to tutor me in Transfiguration, but he refused. I'm a lost cause.",
  "MidResMaleD_11156": "I spent hours trying to conjure a meat pie when I was a first- year, only to then find out about Gamp's Law. Such a disappointment.",
  "MidResMaleD_11157": "I was worried Transfiguration would be too difficult, but it turns out I have a knack for Switching Spells. Mother says it’s my indecisive nature",
  "MidResMaleD_11158": "You'd think Cressida would be perfectly fine with the myriad spells we're taught at Hogwarts.",
  "MidResMaleD_11159": "I'd like to be a few Galleons richer myself.",
  "MidResMaleD_11166": "Next time, I’ll not wager on Imelda.",

  "MidResMaleE_10186": "I'm right here.",
  "MidResMaleE_10189": "Now, this isn't funny.",
  "MidResMaleE_10190": "I shall report you for this!",
  "MidResMaleE_10191": "Argh! – argh! – look what you've done!",
  "MidResMaleE_10192": "You,  you – vile person!",
  "MidResMaleE_10193": "Where's – where's – my – blanket?",
  "MidResMaleE_10194": "This – s – s – isn't – f – funny.",
  "MidResMaleE_10197": "Fun one that, isn't it?",
  "MidResMaleE_10198": "Whoops – wasn't on purpose.",
  "MidResMaleE_10199": "Oh – forgot how sharp that was.",
  "MidResMaleE_10201": "That's a practice shot?",
  "MidResMaleE_10202": "I reckon a Puffskein'd do more damage.",
  "MidResMaleE_10203": "Just get our wand, did we?",
  "MidResMaleE_10208": "Not clever. Or funny.",
  "MidResMaleE_10209": "Ugh – Professor Garlick – ?",
  "MidResMaleE_10212": "Argh! – plant the thing!",
  "MidResMaleE_10213": "Aargh! – Mandrakes!",
  "MidResMaleE_10223": "Ugh. Give me Horklumps any day.",
  "MidResMaleE_10224": "Er – if you don't mind.",
  "MidResMaleE_10225": "Learned a new spell, have we?",
  "MidResMaleE_10226": "I'm still going to report you!",
  "MidResMaleE_10227": "I've been here for long enough now. Put me down!",
  "MidResMaleE_10228": "Oh – oooh – st – op!",
  "MidResMaleE_10229": "Wha – aaaargh!",
  "MidResMaleE_10230": "I won't be had by a bush!",
  "MidResMaleE_10231": "Ugh – I thought they'd never stop.",
  "MidResMaleE_10232": "Ugh – not sure I still have ears.",
  "MidResMaleE_10238": "Easy there, I don't think that's necessary?",
  "MidResMaleE_10239": "Remind me not to get on your wrong side.",
  "MidResMaleE_10240": "In a bad mood, are we?",
  "MidResMaleE_10251": "Looks like they've got the hang of that.",
  "MidResMaleE_10252": "Ha – wonder if I can go that fast?",
  "MidResMaleE_10254": "A Graphorn? Is that even allowed?",
  "MidResMaleE_10255": "Looking good up there!",
  "MidResMaleE_10256": "Now that's just not sensible at all.",
  "MidResMaleE_10257": "Ugh. There's a reason we have brooms.",
  "MidResMaleE_10258": "Nice one rescuing little Archie Bickle. Don't think I'd have managed that.",
  "MidResMaleE_10259": "Heard you helped Natty rescue a Hippogriff? Very good of you to do that, well done.",
  "MidResMaleE_10260": "Isko Rabe should be buying you a Butterbeer after you rescued him. Quite the heroics.",
  "MidResMaleE_10261": "Hear Rookwood's with the authorities 'cause of you. Reckon I'll stay out your way.",
  "MidResMaleE_10263": "Don't worry about Sallow getting in trouble because of you. That lad was born in detention.",
  "MidResMaleE_10264": "Sallow has a sister, you know? Ill or something, I heard.",
  "MidResMaleE_10265": "Saw you with Gaunt. Don't tell me he's still depressed about being a Slytherin?",
  "MidResMaleE_10282": "Don't you have – clothes?",
  "MidResMaleE_10283": "Well done in that broom race – it's about time someone beat Imelda. Bet she felt that.",
  "MidResMaleE_10304": "Is Fig trying to get you to work for him or something?",
  "MidResMaleE_10305": "I never minded Fig. He was one of the good ones.",
  "MidResMaleE_10308": "I never got to meet Lodgok, but I heard he was a truly honourable goblin.",
  "MidResMaleE_10313": "(cheers)",
  "MidResMaleE_10314": "I should think Hecat must be thrilled with your skills.",
  "MidResMaleE_10315": "Have you used a wand before?",
  "MidResMaleE_10318": "What? What are you doing? What is this?",
  "MidResMaleE_10319": "Black is going to love hearing about this!",
  "MidResMaleE_10320": "Ow! Argh!",
  "MidResMaleE_10321": "Argh! You've burnt me!",
  "MidResMaleE_10322": "This – is n – not – funny.",
  "MidResMaleE_10323": "P – put me by the f – fire.",
  "MidResMaleE_10326": "Oh dear. Best get to the hospital wing.",
  "MidResMaleE_10327": "Aah. Looks like you've hurt yourself.",
  "MidResMaleE_10328": "Do be careful – looks like a nasty cut there.",
  "MidResMaleE_10330": "You think you're so powerful.",
  "MidResMaleE_10331": "What was that? Did a Billywig just breathe on me?",
  "MidResMaleE_10332": "I think I just felt the mark of pitiful magic.",
  "MidResMaleE_10337": "What's next? Daisies?",
  "MidResMaleE_10338": "I shall be telling Garlick about this.",
  "MidResMaleE_10341": "Urgh – I hate these things!",
  "MidResMaleE_10342": "Somebody, shut it up!",
  "MidResMaleE_10353": "You've nerve, don't you.",
  "MidResMaleE_10354": "How very clever.",
  "MidResMaleE_10355": "Do you plan on putting me down?",
  "MidResMaleE_10356": "Tell you what: why don't you put me down and I'll make sure you're only expelled!",
  "MidResMaleE_10357": "Aaa – aaargh!",
  "MidResMaleE_10358": "What – are you – doing?",
  "MidResMaleE_10360": "Oh, goodness – they've stopped.",
  "MidResMaleE_10361": "Ugh – I hope it's dead.",
  "MidResMaleE_10367": "You definitely need to work on being more discreet.",
  "MidResMaleE_10372": "You can't ride a broom without the express supervision of Madam Kogawa.",
  "MidResMaleE_10373": "Ugh! Look at them, riding about like they own the place. Madam Kogawa is not going to like this at all.",
  "MidResMaleE_10375": "Oh, now that's just ridiculous. Riding a Graphorn? Is no one in control of this school?",
  "MidResMaleE_10376": "Does anyone plan to tell this person that they are not supposed to be riding a Graphorn?",
  "MidResMaleE_10377": "A Hippogriff! They're riding a Hippogriff! Well? Is anyone going to arrest them?",
  "MidResMaleE_10378": "A Hippogriff. They think it's acceptable to be riding a Hippogriff! Wait till Black hears about this.",
  "MidResMaleE_10379": "Everyone's talking about how you rescued Archie Bickle – 'the new student, the new student' – ugh.",
  "MidResMaleE_10380": "Is there anyone not talking about how you rescued a Hippogriff from Rookwood?  Don't see the fuss.",
  "MidResMaleE_10381": "I'm sure I could've rescued Isko Rabe had I been made aware of the situation.",
  "MidResMaleE_10382": "Did you really get Rookwood taken in? – did you?",
  "MidResMaleE_10384": "Sallow's in detention because of you. Not a very good friend, are you.",
  "MidResMaleE_10385": "Sallow's sister Anne has some injury – goblin curse or something. That's why she's not at school.",
  "MidResMaleE_10386": "Saw you talking to Gaunt. Nice chap, isn't he?",
  "MidResMaleE_10403": "Oh, for Merlin's sake, where are your clothes?",
  "MidResMaleE_10404": "You defeated Imelda Reyes – in a broom race? Has Kogawa been secretly coaching you?",
  "MidResMaleE_10424": "I can't believe Fig's so interesting that you have to spend so much time with him. Puts me to sleep.",
  "MidResMaleE_10425": "You must be sad about Fig. I know you spent a lot of time with him. I don't know what to say really.",
  "MidResMaleE_10428": "I would never have expected Hogwarts to be attacked. Not in all my life.",
  "MidResMaleE_10441": "What are you laughing at?",
  "MidResMaleE_10442": "Argh!",
  "MidResMaleE_10443": "Leave me alone, Peeves – or I'll call the Baron.",
  "MidResMaleE_10444": "(sigh) Always a joy.",
  "MidResMaleE_10445": "Arthur's got you. It's all right.",
  "MidResMaleE_10560": "Did you see the way they just waltzed in at the end of the Sorting Ceremony last night?",
  "MidResMaleE_10561": "I promise you, more teachers nod at you if you're holding a stack of books. I swear, it's true.",
  "MidResMaleE_10562": "I've been tempted to say I lost my wand just to get out of Weasley's assignments. How's that for Transfiguration?",
  "MidResMaleE_10563": "I say, teach me everything going. In fact, if Hecat doesn't hurry up and teach me the Imperius Curse I swear I shall get on that train and go home.",
  "MidResMaleE_10564": "I can't believe she's seen a Thestral. And why should I be impressed anyway. Anyone can find a dead person to look at. She's a little liar.",
  "MidResMaleE_10565": "I tried a Knee-reversal hex on that small Hufflepuff. I found it rather boring, although in all fairness it only partially worked which did look awfully strange.",
  "MidResMaleE_10566": "I shrunk my mother once. I did. Don't give me that look, you weren't there.",
  "MidResMaleE_10567": "Let's be sure we make some time to study later, then. The common room's a bit rowdy of late so I've taken to using the library.",
  "MidResMaleE_10568": "Hmph. I know what you mean.",
  "MidResMaleE_10569": "There was a rumour that if you knocked on the barrels in the rhythm of a Christmas carol, you'd get a present.",
  "MidResMaleE_10570": "Someone loaned me a book on the International Confederation of Wizards. I was looking forward to reading it –",
  "MidResMaleE_10571": "I'd never risk leaving things in the dormitory without a Muggle-Repelling Charm. What? It's highly logical.",
  "MidResMaleE_10572": "I suppose one could smuggle a pet into the dormitory if one was willing to use a Disillusionment Charm. But is it worth it for a common cat?",
  "MidResMaleE_10573": "In Transfiguration I switched the writing ink with Flobberworm Mucus. I thought it'd be funny. And it was. To me.",
  "MidResMaleE_10574": "All I can say is, don't look inside my note books.",
  "MidResMaleE_10575": "Last time I saw your dragon-hide gloves was at the vegetable patch in the greenhouse. Perhaps Garlick picked them up.",
  "MidResMaleE_10576": "I think Garlick puts that Venomous Tentacula near us deliberately. She does, you see next time.",
  "MidResMaleE_10577": "Have you finished your Herbology essay? Mine's only about half an inch thick; and I found a black beetle on it.",
  "MidResMaleE_10578": "Frankly, I'd rather limit my excursions to Hogsmeade these days. Too much distraction.",
  "MidResMaleE_10580": "The only marks you'll be getting in Potions will be from singeing your hands all the time on your cauldron.",
  "MidResMaleE_10581": "I should think I'll get 'Outstanding' when I do my O.W.L.s. I can sleep through a Potions exam and still pass.",
  "MidResMaleE_10582": "You're not still fretting about your Potions essay, are you? Sharp gave me an A and it was barely half an inch.",
  "MidResMaleE_10583": "It's clear Ronen would have a preferred a life in the theatre.",
  "MidResMaleE_10584": "Madam Kogawa's getting a bit of an easy run of things, isn't she, what with Quidditch being cancelled?",
  "MidResMaleE_10585": "'Oh Professor, I turned myself into someone who hasn't done their homework!'.",
  "MidResMaleE_10586": "Invented by the witch whose cabbage patch had a visit from the first ever Quaffle supposedly.",
  "MidResMaleE_10587": "Gertie Keddle, that was her name. Lived on the edge of a marsh, they say.  Takes all sorts.",
  "MidResMaleE_10588": "I highly recommend it when you want an extra serving of Cauldron Cake; there's nothing they can do. And try to be out when it wears off.",
  "MidResMaleE_10589": "Scribner's got it in for me but at least the place is quiet.",
  "MidResMaleE_10590": "It was a complete lie. Just a trick being played by Hufflepuffs. Very disappointing.",
  "MidResMaleE_10591": "(exasperated groans)",
  "MidResMaleE_10592": "How do we know some stray Muggle-born isn't on the lookout for ways to bring us all down?",
  "MidResMaleE_10593": "I don't understand why they're even allowed to attend.",
  "MidResMaleE_10594": "– but I put it down in the dormitory and for the life of me I can't find it anywhere now.",
  "MidResMaleE_10595": " Why are you smiling? It's going to be a fascinating book!",
  "MidResMaleE_10596": "You'd be hard pressed to find a page that didn't feature a unicorn. I can't help that I'm so good at drawing them.",
  "MidResMaleE_10597": "I'm telling you, you could lose your life in Herbology. Especially when the teacher's got it in for you.",
  "MidResMaleE_10598": "Do you think that's a good omen?",
  "MidResMaleE_10599": "My parents are expecting high marks and spending time in Zonko's isn't exactly helping the cause, is it?",
  "MidResMaleE_10601": "You know it does help to look at the thing while you're stirring?",
  "MidResMaleE_10602": "In my blood, my mother says. From her side, at least.",
  "MidResMaleE_10603": "The way he conducts himself, well, I think if you gave him a chance, he'd trade his wand for a top hat.",
  "MidResMaleE_10604": "Still, I can tell she's very disappointed about the whole thing.",
  "MidResMaleE_10605": "I saw her give Black the evil eyes last week. It's a wonder he didn't turn into a Quaffle on the spot.",
  "MidResMaleE_10606": "Pity more people can't watch the duels.",
  "MidResMaleE_10607": "I can't seem to master the Wiggenweld Potion. Perhaps my stirring technique's a bit off.",
  "MidResMaleE_10608": "Nothing to be learned at Hogwarts that one cannot learn out in the world. Course, there's something to be said for eating the house-elves' quince pie whilst learning.",
  "MidResMaleE_10609": "Wish our common room was bigger. I can never find enough space to spread out my star charts.",
  "MidResMaleE_10610": "They really shouldn't allow food and drinks in the common room. Stepped in a puddle of Butterbeer the other day. Better than a failed potion, I suppose.",
  "MidResMaleE_10611": "I can't even cast <i>Lumos</i> for two seconds to do a bit of late-night reading without my dormmates getting riled up.",
  "MidResMaleE_10612": "We're going to see who can stay up the latest. Sleeping Draughts should ensure my victory.",
  "MidResMaleE_10613": "Got called on to read out loud in History of Magic the other day.  Stumbled over all the words. Think I even bored Binns and that's saying something.",
  "MidResMaleE_10614": "Tried to summon the pepper at  dinner last week and dropped a pudding into our prefect's lap. Not sure who felt it more, me or her.",
  "MidResMaleE_10615": "Do you think Elizabeth would like a Fanged Geranium? They're beautiful and terrifying – a bit like her.",
  "MidResMaleE_10616": "Thought I'd impress Garlick by showing her my Mimbulus mimbletonia. Squirted Stinksap all over myself.",
  "MidResMaleE_10617": "I can appreciate Hogsmeade all year round, but there's nothing like it after a fresh snowfall.",
  "MidResMaleE_10618": "In my opinion, Divination is a load of rubbish. Professor Onai seems so logical. I don't understand how she believes the things she teaches.",
  "MidResMaleE_10619": "Wouldn't be surprised it Professor Binns bored himself to death with one of his history lectures.",
  "MidResMaleE_10620": "My older brothers were all sorted into Ravenclaw. They're terribly accomplished now. I'll never be able to live up to their achievements.",
  "MidResMaleE_10621": "I adore decorating for the holidays. Can never have too many fairy lights, in my opinion. Not sure the fairies would agree, mind.",
  "MidResMaleE_10622": "My family and I travel somewhere every summer. I’m dying to visit Romania. Would love to see a dragon in the flesh.",
  "MidResMaleE_10623": "I wonder how we'd get into Black's office. Not that I’d want to go in, mind you. Well, not if he’s there.",
  "MidResMaleE_10624": "Muggle school is so dull compared to Hogwarts. I’d imagine. Never been to a Muggle school myself.",
  "MidResMaleE_10625": "Hogwarts is a second home to me. Feeling a bit nostalgic about leaving one day.",
  "MidResMaleE_10626": "I should like to retire to a small hamlet when I'm older. One just like Brocburrow.",
  "MidResMaleE_10627": "I adore the hamlets near the coast. They're a bit damp, but ever so picturesque.",
  "MidResMaleE_10628": "Apparently Marunweem was having a bit of a poacher problem. I wonder if that's still the case.",
  "MidResMaleE_10629": "There are some impressive new brooms at Spintwitches.",
  "MidResMaleE_10630": "It's time to trade in my Oakshaft 79 for a newer model.",
  "MidResMaleE_10631": "That Reyes girl thinks she can fly better than anyone. All talk if you ask me.",
  "MidResMaleE_10632": "Wonder what Kogawa thinks of Quidditch being cancelled. Bet she's fuming.",
  "MidResMaleE_10633": "I just know we were finally going to win the Quidditch Cup this year.",
  "MidResMaleE_10634": "Good thing Professor Weasley takes her role seriously since Black clearly has no interest in his.",
  "MidResMaleE_10635": "How much longer do you think Black will be Headmaster? I have family in America. Wonder if I could transfer to Ilvermorny and come back when he's gone.",
  "MidResMaleE_10636": "Black noticed a scuff on his shoe the other day and would not take another step until a house-elf polished it away for him. Horrid man.",
  "MidResMaleE_10637": "Why would anyone bother sending secret love letters? If you want to win me over, just treat me to a Butterbeer at the Three Broomsticks.",
  "MidResMaleE_10638": "I sent an anonymous Howler to Duncan Hobhouse last year because he kept leaving his dirty clothes all over the dormitory. You should have seen the look on his face.",
  "MidResMaleE_10639": "I don't think owls make very good pets. You can't snuggle up to them the way you can with a cat.",
  "MidResMaleE_10640": "I need to catch up on my letter-writing. I think my owl's getting cobwebs.",
  "MidResMaleE_10641": "My brother caused a lot of trouble in Professor Weasley's class when he was at school. He’d idly wave his wand whilst daydreaming and Transfigure someone’s book into a beetle.",
  "MidResMaleE_10642": "I tried to Transfigure my parchment into a blanket. Wanted a little nap. Would've been fine if it hadn't caught fire.",
  "MidResMaleE_10643": "You think Garreth Weasley would be better at Transfiguration considering his aunt teaches the thing.",
  "MidResMaleE_10644": "Professor Weasley's easily my favourite. Her wandwork is exquisite.",
  "MidResMaleE_10645": "Are you going to help Zenobia find her Gobstones?",
  "MidResMaleE_10652": "Vandalism? Really?",
  "MidResMaleE_10653": "Someone's got places to be.",
  "MidResMaleE_10654": "Couldn't pay me to ride a Graphorn.",
  "MidResMaleE_10655": "Who would choose to ride a Hippogriff? They've got to smell awful.",
  "MidResMaleE_10656": "I didn't think you were allowed to wear those outside of bed.",
  "MidResMaleE_10660": "I really should ask Professor Fig about his class.",
  "MidResMaleE_10661": "Pity about Professor Fig.",
  "MidResMaleE_10662": "What would a troll want in Hogsmeade anyway?",
  "MidResMaleE_10663": "Never thought Ranrok would be so bold as to attack the school.",
  "MidResMaleE_10664": "Crossed Wands champion, eh?",
  "MidResMaleE_10665": "Imelda must be losing her touch if someone managed to best her.",
  "MidResMaleE_10666": "Next year I'm winning Summoner's Court champion.",
  "MidResMaleE_10667": "Perhaps I should make some friends this year. Natty seems nice.",
  "MidResMaleE_10668": "Where's your new friend, Poppy?",
  "MidResMaleE_10669": "Sebastian isn't the sort of friend I'd want to have.",
  "MidResMaleE_10670": "Must be nice being friends with Amit.",
  "MidResMaleE_10671": "Can't believe Imelda's managed to make a friend.",
  "MidResMaleE_10672": "Everett's hardly what I'd call respectable company.",
  "MidResMaleE_10673": "Watch out! It's the troll slayer of Hogsmeade!",
  "MidResMaleE_10674": "Can't believe Ferdinand Pratt got me detention.",
  "MidResMaleE_10675": "The Hog's Head crowd will just love Ferdinand hanging there. (chuckles)",
  "MidResMaleE_10676": "Heard you burned Ferdinand's frame. Good one.",
  "MidResMaleE_10677": "If an Auror were here they'd put you away for that.",
  "MidResMaleE_10678": "Forget your keys, did you?",
  "MidResMaleE_10680": "Hogwarts will forever be indebted to you.",
  "MidResMaleE_10681": "Sebastian took that duelling loss rather gamely.",
  "MidResMaleE_10682": "Really mastered that one, haven't you?",
  "MidResMaleE_10683": "Why ever did the music room bells stop ringing in the first place?",
  "MidResMaleE_10684": "Easy!",
  "MirabelGarlick_10639": "Now remember: a wand is not a trowel.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10647": "The dittany seeds you need can be found on the table in the back.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10666": "The edges mustn't curl and turn brown like that.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10667": "Keep at it. A garden requires patience as much as water and sunlight.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10668": "Your weeds possess their own – rugged – form of beauty.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10669": "The Venomous Tentacula isn't so much murderous as it is simply misunderstood.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10670": "There’s plenty of dragon dung in case you run out. Feel free to plunge right in.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10671": "If you plant every day, harvest time is always soon to follow.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10672": "Water, soil, sunlight, and a touch of magic; that’s all your garden needs.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10673": "Students are like plants; they require nutrients from a variety of sources.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10674": "When you grow a plant, you bring joy into the world.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10685": "How wonderful it is to see you again, Lenora, dear! Oh, here. You’ll need these for today’s class.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10686": "A little treat for your auntie.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10687": "Ah, hello!",
  "MirabelGarlick_10688": "Class, please welcome the newest rose in our garden.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10689": "The prudent Herbologist is no more afraid of the Venomous Tentacula than the Bouncing Bulb.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10690": "Now, then. Today we will be acquainting ourselves with the mellifluous tuber known as the Mandrake Root.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10691": "<i>Accio</i>.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10692": "Let’s see if we can make our fibrous friends a bit more comfortable, shall we? First, let's protect our ears.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10693": "Now, everyone grip their Mandrake by the tendrils and give it a firm tug.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10694": "Quickly! Place your Mandrakes in the new pot and pat down the soil!",
  "MirabelGarlick_10695": "The soil should envelop the root like a warm, dirty, blanket, putting the Mandrake right at ease.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10696": "<i>Reparo</i>.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10697": "I’m very sorry about that. Yours was a bit mature, I’m afraid.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10698": "Splendid work, everyone.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10699": "We do look forward to growing together.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10701": "How thrilling it is to have everyone back together again! This year will be filled with enchantment and excitement, but the most important thing cultivated in Herbology is knowledge.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10705": "Firstly, well done with your Mandrake.  They can be rather difficult to – get a grasp of.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10706": "Well, yes. Of course, the cry of a mature Mandragora can be fatal. So remember to keep those ears protected.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10708": "How kind of you. It seems you're already taking to Herbology like a Mandrake to fresh soil.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10737": "Your part in all this floral alchemy is simple. Take the seeds to your potting table, plant them and then wait for harvest time.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10742": "All right then, off you go.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10750": "I suppose Professor Black knows best, but the students are terribly disappointed about Quidditch being cancelled.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10751": "Oh I suppose I should pay closer attention in the next match, if there ever is one.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10753": "I hope there are no students in the hospital wing on account of my Venomous Tentacula.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10754": "Remember, there are no weeds at Hogwarts, just flowers whose acquaintance we've not yet made.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10758": "Wonderful! I hope you gained a greater appreciation for the flora in our lives. I am forever enraptured by it.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10836": "Of course, dear. Professor Weasley has kindly asked that I give you some tasks to ensure that your learning continues to flourish outside of the classroom.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10837": "Once you've completed them all, be sure to return to me, and I'll know that you're ready to learn <i>Flipendo</i>.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10877": "Just yesterday I spent hours pruning my self-fertilising shrubs and Flutterby bushes. Didn't realise how long I'd been at it until the sun began to set.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10878": "Kindness and concern are as necessary in the greenhouse as in the Great Hall.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10879": "To make anything grow we must first understand it. That goes for plants as well as friendships.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10909": "They're in the other greenhouse. It's just at the end of the footbridge leading out of this room. Your classmate, Mr Prewett, has kindly offered to accompany you.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10918": "And good – as you do seem to be quite green-fingered. I'm eager to see your skill in the soil continue to blossom.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10919": "That concludes class. I hope everyone has a wonderful rest of their day.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10952": "Just the person I'd hoped to see.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10954": "They're meant to help you hone your magical skills outside of the classroom – thus preparing you to learn a new charm: <i>Wingardium Leviosa</i>.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10955": "When you're finished with them, come and see me and we'll work on the charm together. I look forward to it.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10956": "I'll be sure to let her know how well you're coming along.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10957": "Well done!",
  "MirabelGarlick_10964": "Well, if there's one thing I love to see more than my plants thriving, it's one of my students doing the same.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10966": "Now, ready to learn <i>Flipendo</i>? Chin up, keep a light grip – and it's all in the wrist. Let's see you give it a go.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10968": "I would like to teach you <i>Wingardium Leviosa</i>. It can be used to levitate objects for a short time. Once you've completed a few prerequisite tasks, do see me after class.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10969": "Wonderfully done!",
  "MirabelGarlick_10970": "If you'd like to practise a bit more, you're welcome to do so here in the greenhouse. Just – mind the plants, please.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10971": "Look at that. You're a natural.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10972": "How would you like to learn the Knockback Jinx, <i>Flipendo</i>? Once you've completed the necessary tasks, come and find me in the Greenhouse.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10973": "Feel free to practise <i>Wingardium Leviosa</i> here in the greenhouse. I've set some crates out for you in the next room.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10974": "You're a natural.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10981": "<i>Wingardium Leviosa</i> requires a bit of concentration and a nice, graceful wand movement. Let's see you try your hand at it.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10982": "Pleased to hear it. Professor Weasley will be too.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10987": "Well done. Once it can be harvested, your dittany will be ready to use in Wiggenweld Potion. I'll let Professor Sharp tell you about that.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10989": "Er – How's that?",
  "MirabelGarlick_10990": "Anyway, I had high hopes for Hufflepuff. I was finally going to learn the Quidditch rules.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10991": "I'm partial to Hufflepuff myself. – What was that?",
  "MirabelGarlick_10992": "I thought I heard something. Perhaps not.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10993": "Hufflepuff? Not Ravenclaw?",
  "MirabelGarlick_10994": "The cabbages do get testy without something to chew. Fortunately, I have a dummy for them to gnaw on. Be a dear and let them have a good chomping.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10995": "Come back and see me when you're finished. Oh, and – mind your fingers. They do bite.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10996": "I'd like you to get some hands-on experience with the Chinese Chomping Cabbages.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10997": "They're in the greenhouse just across the footbridge. Mr Prewett will assist you with them.",
  "MirabelGarlick_10998": "Remarkable plants, aren't they? I hope they weren't too much trouble – don't see any bite marks or – missing digits.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11000": "I'm glad – Herbology is a bounteous subject. Tend to your garden, and it will tend to you.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11001": "I think you'll come to see that the fruit is well worth the labour. As we Herbologists like to say – 'tend to your plants, and they'll tend to you.'",
  "MirabelGarlick_11006": "You can all get started – I need to have a brief word with our new student.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11008": "Dittany's restorative properties make it a vital ingredient in the Wiggenweld Potion, as you all should know from Professor Sharp's class.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11018": "Now, what say we branch out? Introduce you to a different sort of flora – the Chinese Chomping Cabbage.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11034": "Now, for our next task, we'll be planting dittany at our potting tables.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11035": "Now as I mentioned, next we will be planting dittany. Let us find you some seeds.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11036": "You've visited the Magic Neep? Wonderful. A prepared student is bound to bloom.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11037": "Plant the seeds there now and you can return to harvest them later. Even with soil, sunlight, and a bit of magic – they will take time to grow.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11050": "I've arranged for you to have your own potting table here in the classroom. Wasn't easy to spare one on such late notice.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11053": "Well everyone, that's all for today. Class is dismissed. Go forth and blossom!",
  "MirabelGarlick_11054": "How wonderful to see you again.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11056": "So nice to see you again.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11060": "Now, where was I? Oh. Yes. The greenhouse won't keep itself in order –without a nudge from me.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11061": "Perhaps a hybrid – Bouncing Tentacula.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11062": "And with that helpful reminder as to why we should always wear our dragon-hide gloves, I shall end our lesson here.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11069": "You'll find that some plants are better suited to uses outside of a cauldron.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11072": "That's a relief. I mean, about the Venomous Tentacula.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11073": "Ah! To what do I owe this pleasure?",
  "MirabelGarlick_11074": "You will want to focus with this spell. Nothing as mortifying as knocking back a colleague when all you wanted to do was move a few pots.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11075": "When executed correctly, you should be able to pick up boulders as though they were sprigs of Sneezewort.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11076": "Like a weed in a flowerbed, I fear you are out of place.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11077": "I'm afraid I must root you out.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11078": "That wasn't a Bouncing Bulb I heard.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11079": "Do I hear the patter of students' feet?",
  "MirabelGarlick_11080": "My students are all studying – or planting. Glad to see they're not wandering the Faculty Tower.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11081": "I must be hearing things. Too much time engaging with Mandrakes.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11082": "Professor Hecat tells me she taught you <i>Levioso</i>. So you should be ready for a more advanced levitation charm.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11083": "Terribly sorry Mr Clopton.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11084": "Before we plant the seed, we must till the soil!",
  "MirabelGarlick_11085": "How lovely of you to ask. I've always had an affinity for greenery, so this situation is a bit of a dream come true.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11086": "After graduation, I was thrilled to be asked to step in for my old Herbology professor. He'd had a slight accident, you see.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11087": "Hm. Well, he never cared – really cared for the plants. And they could sense it. You'd be surprised how perceptive a plant can be.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11088": "At any rate, the trouble began one day when he cut into a Wiggentree.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11089": "Unfortunately for him, its leaves were hiding a Bowtruckle – you may recall, the marvellous creatures that resemble a twig.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11090": "The little beast gouged the professor's eyes quite fiercely. Terrifying, I'd imagine. Likely for the professor too.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11091": "Well, not quite. After three weeks at St Mungo's, my predecessor regained a tiny bit of his eyesight. He insisted on returning to the greenhouse.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11092": "Within a week, he had – he claims by accident – kicked a Chinese Chomping Cabbage. So it was back to St Mungo's for him.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11093": "Mm. Well, I felt awful for him – but I daresay I felt a bit more sympathy for the cabbage.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11094": "Upon his discharge from the hospital, his indifference to plants had turned to utter disdain.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11095": "He lost what little patience he had left with a particularly temperamental Venomous Tentacula, and, well –",
  "MirabelGarlick_11097": "Very kind of you to say. I do love these gardens and helping my students grow.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11098": "Last I heard, he'd gone to Romania. As rumour would have it, he developed a sudden interest in dragons.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11099": "Hmm. Lovely speaking with you. Have a wonderful day!",
  "MirabelGarlick_11100": "The plants are resting, so now's as good a time as any.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11101": "Oh, how nice of you to ask! Well, let's see. I grew up in London. Right on the Thames.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11102": "To some, yes. I used to dream of living in the country. But, it wasn't until I came to Hogwarts that I felt truly at home.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11109": "You see, as a child, I knew nothing of witches or wizards. You can imagine how astonished I was to receive my letter from Hogwarts!",
  "MirabelGarlick_11112": "Well, we each bloom differently, don't we? Some of us, like Devil's Snare, thrive in the shadows – whilst others crave the attention of a Bouncing Bulb.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11119": "Certainly. What's on your mind?",
  "MirabelGarlick_11122": "– his resulting leave of absence continues to this day.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11123": "Oh, and remember: be kind to your Wiggentrees.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11124": "I used to dream of just that. But it wasn't until I came to Hogwarts that I felt truly at home.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11127": "One can only hope he found more happiness working with them than he did with flora.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11128": "Not to worry! I'll be here if you'd like to talk.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11129": "Of course! Even the chattiest cabbage needs a moment of respite.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11130": "Mind you, it did take some time. And whilst it is my fervent hope that each student eventually feels as at home here as I do, it is not always the case.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11131": "And we each grow and thrive according to our own plan. I was terribly nervous when I arrived at the castle.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11132": "Precisely. And I was remarkably fortunate.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11133": "Oh, but I've given you the wrong impression! On the contrary. I was shown great kindness.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11134": "In fact, a seventh-year took me under her wing during those first days. She remains one of my dearest friends.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11135": "I spent a good deal of time alone in either the greenhouse or the library my first days here.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11136": "It was indeed! How on earth did you know that?",
  "MirabelGarlick_11137": "Oh, darling Mrs Sprottle! She was always astonished I knew as much magic as I did being Muggle-born.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11138": "I was indeed.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11139": "I daresay you'll find that the friends you make here at Hogwarts will last a lifetime.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11140": "Now, I'd best get to my recent delivery from The Magic Neep. Mr Teasdale promised me quite an assortment of seeds this week!",
  "MirabelGarlick_11141": "Lovely to see you.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11142": "Hmm. Well, I suppose that's everything. Do come by for a chat some time. I so enjoy checking in with my new students.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11143": "Flouting the norms of the day, I see! (chirp) I suppose we each bloom in our own way.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11145": "Professor Fig was always so kind to me – and to all of his students. I shall miss speaking with him about Magical Theory and Herbology. What a brilliant mind.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11146": "I'm not surprised the villagers rose up so valiantly against those trolls. I have dear friends in Hogsmeade and they're a talented, courageous lot – not to be trifled with.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11147": "I'm so proud of my fellow professors for all that they did to keep us safe. No one shall take down Hogwarts.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11148": "Professor Weasley said how 'exceedingly well' you've done catching up this year. I'm not surprised at all at how quickly you've bloomed.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11149": "Miss Sweeting seems to have the affinity for magical beasts that I have for magical plants. Such passion for a subject should be encouraged.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11150": "Oh dear. I'm afraid you've rather veered outside of the curriculum.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11152": "I gather you bravely fought for Hogwarts. Such courage has not gone unnoticed. We are forever grateful to you.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11153": "Well done! I might suggest you practise such manoeuvres in a more secluded location.",
  "MirabelGarlick_11154": "Oh! Lovely to see you.",
  "MudiwaOnai_00031": "(frustrated grunt)",

  "MudiwaOnai_10304": "Natty! No!",
  "MudiwaOnai_10305": "Steer them this way. We shall make quick work of them. (Grunts)",
  "MudiwaOnai_10482": "– based upon the knowledge that one's present, and even one's past, may reveal traces of what is to come, what do you see in your own future?",
  "MudiwaOnai_10486": "Seeing the future is only part of what I teach my students. They must also be prepared for what the future may hold.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10487": "When you have finished the tasks, return to me and you will be able to learn <i>Descendo</i>. I shall be waiting.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10494": "Hmm. The future is not etched in stone. It can be carved out by those with very strong wills. And you do seem to possess one.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10495": "But this talk of tomorrow should not divert us from your present success. I shall inform our good Deputy Headmistress of your exemplary performance.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10500": "Very well done. Although I must admit, I did have something of a premonition that you would follow through.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10501": "At times, the future is murky to us all. As with rippling water, one must wait for things to settle before the reflection becomes clear.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10502": "A measured perception, very wise. Nothing worthwhile is ever easy. And that is why such futures are worth striving for.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10503": "Hmm, I see. Know that such omens are not damning, if they can at least – prepare us.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10504": "And if that performance is any omen of what your future may hold, then I for one see great things.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10527": "Hmm, a measured perception. I have found that we triumph most often when we weather hardship together. 'Rain does not fall on one roof alone,' as my husband was fond of saying.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10528": "I see. Well, I knew that you and Sebastian Sallow were close, but now you are even beginning to speak like him.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10529": "Now, as you have no doubt sharpened your perception by completing my assignment, I am curious –",
  "MudiwaOnai_10530": "And you are preparing yourself, even now.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10531": "But danger has not shaken you yet. I caught word of your efforts to return a dragon egg to the clutch of its mother – and a protective mother is no trivial danger, fire-breathing or not. ",
  "MudiwaOnai_10532": "I would only caution you – be careful what you take. The future you carve out cannot be taken back.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10533": "Are you sure you are up for a visitor?",
  "MudiwaOnai_10534": "Very well. But do not overdo it, Natsai.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10556": "Please see me after class once you have completed the tasks I have set for you. I would like to teach you <i>Descendo</i> – useful for pulling objects to the ground.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10559": "That will be all for today. You are dismissed.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10560": "Hello. Did you get my owl?",
  "MudiwaOnai_10569": "This will be a worthwhile experience.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10570": "You have it. Now, why not practise the new spell on the training dummy?",
  "MudiwaOnai_10571": "Excellent! I think you have it.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10572": "I hope those assignments were challenging enough for you.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10573": "Channel your magic towards your target.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10574": "At some point you must stop preparing and put your newly honed skills to the test, outside of the classroom.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10590": "You know what it was, Natsai.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10592": "Careful? Officer Singer disagrees. She sent me an owl telling me that you have been trying to collect evidence of some kind against Dark wizards.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10593": "She berated me for not keeping a closer eye on you, and she is right. I do not want you visiting Hogsmeade for the near future.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10594": "My little gazelle – you are well-intentioned, but you must not meddle in the affairs of dangerous people.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10595": "I must get to class. Perhaps your friend can get you to listen to reason.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10596": "Hence the need for you to complete certain tasks as part of your education.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10597": "I had hoped to speak with you alone, Natsai.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10643": "I do.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10644": "I sensed as much.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10645": "I have enjoyed our conversation.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10646": "Ah. The art of Divination is an important yet often misunderstood branch of magic.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10647": "Now, I know that we both have places to be. Not because I have the Sight, mind you, but because I am a professor and you are a student.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10648": "Those of us who possess the Sight are rare, and, as is often the case with the unique among us, we can frequently be misread – even feared.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10649": "We often do not believe in what we ourselves have not seen. I should hope that you will open your mind.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10650": "When I was granted the opportunity to teach others about my gift and the good it can do, I was most grateful.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10651": "You are a student at Hogwarts, after all. It cannot have escaped you that we in the wizarding world are forever navigating the seemingly inexplicable.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10652": "– and so divining what is to come is not as simple as gazing into a crystal ball or studying the bottom of a teacup.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10653": "Yes. Natsai and I both loved Uganda – and Uagadou – but we are happily settled here now.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10654": "'Intriguing.' That is one word for it. And I am certain you will come to understand many things more deeply in the days ahead.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10655": "I had foreseen such a change, but did not know the details until it occurred. I was glad of the outcome.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10656": "You would be wise to remember that the consequences of our actions are complex –",
  "MudiwaOnai_10674": "– flying on winged beasts. Perhaps unsurprisingly, she will neither confirm nor deny my visions – unless it suits her.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10675": "Of course.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10676": "I can. That is an easy question. We are here because of Professor Weasley.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10677": "But, back to your original question. Professor Weasley had heard of my work and life in Matabeleland – and my time teaching at Uagadou.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10678": "Now, I must return to my work. As I have told Natsai, do be careful. I had a vision earlier this year of her with a friend –",
  "MudiwaOnai_10679": "As I suspected.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10680": "I knew of Professor Weasley. As you may or may not be aware, Professor Weasley's work once took her around the globe.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10681": "Without providing detail that is not mine to share, I can say that she was well-known in our wizarding community for –",
  "MudiwaOnai_10682": "That sounds like Natsai. I am glad she has found a friend in you.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10683": "– well, sharing magical knowledge between countries.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10684": "She was Deputy Headmistress at Hogwarts by then, and when the position of Divination Professor became available, she contacted me.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10685": "Indeed. Although I suspect there is much about each of your professors that would surprise and impress you.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10686": "It was an African sorcerer, in fact, who shared the Unlocking Charm with a certain wizard from London. A thief, rather unfortunately.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10687": "Natsai was as ready as I was for a new adventure. So, off we went.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10688": "Such exchanges of information – Ministry-sanctioned or not – have occurred for centuries.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10689": "Her timing was perfect. I had just foreseen a change in Natsai's and my circumstances and knew that we needed to leave Uganda.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10690": "I suspect there is much about each of your professors that would surprise and impress you.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10691": "That is hardly appropriate school attire.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10693": "Professor Fig seems consumed by his research – it is a wonder he has time left to teach.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10694": "The aura of our school has darkened since Professor Fig's passing.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10695": "I had hoped that Natsai would be safe here, but after the troll attack in Hogsmeade, I am not so sure.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10696": "It is astonishing that Ranrok's Loyalists would dare to attack Hogwarts.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10697": "My stars, stop that immediately!",
  "MudiwaOnai_10699": "Thank you for protecting our school.",
  "MudiwaOnai_10700": "Ah!",
  "MudiwaOnai_10701": "Hello.",
  "MusicConductor_10000": "Come, students. Listen to the art we are about to produce for the pleasure of your ears.",
  "MusicConductor_10001": "Stop a moment and listen to our song.",
  "MusicConductor_10002": "Take a moment to allow our music to soothe your heart.",
  "MusicConductor_10003": "Attention, fellow artists. Another performance, if you would.",
  "MusicConductor_10004": "Eyes on me, musicians. We're about to begin our next piece.",
  "MusicConductor_10005": "Very good. Now, artists, let us begin.",
  "MusicConductor_10006": "We beg silence of you.",
  "MusicConductor_10007": "Quiet, please. We are making art.",
  "MusicConductor_10008": "A moment of your silence and attention shall soon be rewarded.",
  "MusicConductor_10009": "No sour notes, please.",
  "MusicConductor_10010": "Oh, whoever played that note needs to reconsider their profession.",
  "MusicConductor_10011": "Must we go back to practising our scales?",
  "MusicConductor_10012": "Pay particular attention to the strings in this next piece. Your heart will soar.",
  "MusicConductor_10013": "This next composition took some practice, so do listen closely.",
  "MusicConductor_10014": "Another selection for you all. This was composed long before any of us were even painted.",
  "MusicConductor_10015": "Thank you kindly for letting us grace your ears.",
  "MusicConductor_10016": "You are too kind. We thank you. Please, hold your applause.",
  "MusicConductor_10017": "You have our gratitude. It has been our pleasure.",
  "MusicConductor_10018": "I do believe it's the Headmaster. Had I but known, I could have prepared a suitable piece.",
  "MusicConductor_10019": "There shall be no performance until the audience is properly dressed.",
  "MusicConductor_10021": "Unfortunate news about Professor Fig. He was certainly a man of conviction.",
  "MusicConductor_10022": "Perhaps a bit of music might have soothed the rampage.",
  "MusicConductor_10023": "The Dark Arts are hardly artful.",
  "MusicConductor_10025": "If only there were an usher to escort you out of here.",
  "MusicConductor_10026": "Perhaps I can convince the Headmaster to allow a midnight performance sometime.",
  "MusicConductor_10027": "Perhaps a performance is in order. An étude, perhaps? But which one? I shall need to think on it.",
  "MusicConductor_10028": "I should pay old Diggory's portrait a visit. Such a well-informed chap, that one.",
  "MusicConductor_10029": "If you have any opinions about the sort of music I conduct, I suggest keeping them to yourself.",
  "MusicConductor_10030": "I'm afraid that's hardly enough light to conduct a performance, but thank you all the same.",
  "MusicConductor_10031": "Wonderfully percussive sounds, but hardly suitable for an orchestral performance.",

  "NatsaiOnai_10213": "I knew men like him in Uganda. I know how bad things can get if they are not stopped.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10214": "It is a long story – one I promise to share when we have more time. For now, let us do what we came to do.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10215": "Shall we head to the Three Broomsticks?",

  "NatsaiOnai_10242": "Well, I've had better days, but Nurse Blainey says that I am on the mend.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10244": "We should speak with Mr Bickle's friends. I believe I can sneak away without drawing my mother's eye. Meet me near Hogsmeade, and we will devise a plan.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10245": "Something approaches.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10246": "Danger has found us.",

  "NatsaiOnai_10263": "That's the Forbidden Forest on the left. It's off limits to students – as the name implies.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10264": "The professors claim it is too dangerous. I think that calling it 'forbidden' only makes it more alluring.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10265": "Ah – there's Hogsmeade over the crest. Past that ruin.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10267": "That should keep them down.",

  "NatsaiOnai_10334": "Oh, these Rookwood wizards are such a thorn in my hoof!",
  "NatsaiOnai_10335": "Let's see what these awful Rookwood wizards are hiding.",

  "NatsaiOnai_10362": "Go lightly, be as a shadow.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10553": "Here – behind you. There is an open seat here.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10554": "Hello, I am Natty. So you are the new student? Have you met Professor Ronen yet – ?",
  "NatsaiOnai_10557": "Well done back there. You took the loss in stride. Didn't want to go too easy on you.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10560": "Nicely done.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10561": "Oh dear.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10573": "To put it lightly. I remember how I felt when I first arrived.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10577": "I appreciate your confidence.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10598": "Quite impressive!",
  "NatsaiOnai_10599": "Brilliant!",
  "NatsaiOnai_10600": "Well done.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10601": "Keep trying.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10602": "Do not be discouraged.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10603": "Ah, you almost had it.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10604": "That is not bad!",
  "NatsaiOnai_10616": "Not to worry, Mrs Bickle. My father used to say that 'rain does not fall on one roof alone.' We are here to help each other.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10617": "We will find him. He cannot have gone far.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10618": "I used to wander about when I was his age. No idea what I was getting myself into.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10619": "Surely he did not go too much farther.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10644": "A tie game! It turns out we were evenly matched.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10668": "I knew I could rely on you.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10702": "It was a beautiful day. My mother had gone to tend to a neighbour who was ill, and so my father and I were galloping in the savanna.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10704": "We were on our way home when we surprised a group of bandits who had come from our village.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10705": "One of them saw me just as he removed a scarf from his face. He shouted and then aimed his rifle.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10706": "As he fell, my father changed back into his human form. When the bandits saw this, they turned and ran in fear. Magic terrified them.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10709": "No. Vengeance is not what drives me. My father would not want that.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10710": "Well, as you saw, she worries a great deal. She is an excellent Seer, but I think it bothers her to this day that she did not see my father's death coming.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10711": "She misses him, as do I. So I believe on some level she understands my need to seek justice in a small way.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10712": "But that does not mean that she likes it.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10713": "We all have our burdens. My father had a saying about that.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10714": "Exactly.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10731": "You will get what is coming to you!",
  "NatsaiOnai_10732": "You are all going to Azkaban for a very long time.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10734": "Who do you think you are, terrorising people in this way?",
  "NatsaiOnai_10738": "Do you really believe that you are somehow in control here?",
  "NatsaiOnai_10739": "No! No!",
  "NatsaiOnai_10743": "What? No! Do not blame yourself for this.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10747": " He made a choice. Based on instinct. My father.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10748": "You, my friend, are no more to blame for my injuries today than I am to blame for my father's sacrifice years ago.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10845": "Here we go!",
  "NatsaiOnai_10846": "Watch this –",
  "NatsaiOnai_10847": "Let us see this –",
  "NatsaiOnai_10848": "Be sharp –",
  "NatsaiOnai_10853": "Took weeks for me to get anything right when I transferred here. It gets easier, I promise.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10856": "Do not think I will start going easy on you now.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10857": "I know everyone is watching, but try not to be nervous. You are doing quite well.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10858": "Not exactly your typical lesson, is it? Not that I mind.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10859": "You are not making this easy for me, are you?",
  "NatsaiOnai_10860": "I will get you back for that.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10861": "Ouch! Well-played.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10862": "Oh! That was an execution!",
  "NatsaiOnai_10894": "Oh, my. That is a good question. In theory, yes. Although he would worry, as my mother does.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10895": "And I think he would have enjoyed knowing that I had a compatriot like you.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10899": "That is how it's done!",
  "NatsaiOnai_10900": "Yes!",
  "NatsaiOnai_10901": "(relieved sigh)",
  "NatsaiOnai_10902": "There we go!",
  "NatsaiOnai_10903": "I thought I had that.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10904": "Oh dear me.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10905": "Concentrate, Natsai.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10906": "Oh no.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10910": "Please do not worry, Mrs Bickle. We will bring Archie home.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10922": "Psst. Over here. Quietly.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10929": "Everyone will tell you to visit at Christmas, but that's one of the few times of year I would rather be indoors.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10930": "Hogsmeade is beautiful this time of year.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10931": "Oh, I do not mind the cold so much, but it has taken some getting used to. I did not grow up around snow.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10932": "Ancient Runes – if anyone actually used them, we would not be calling them ancient.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10934": "Oh, wait. Over here.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10935": "They are interesting to look at, but if you stew them you can also use them in potion-making.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10937": "You should see all of this at night. The stars are breathtaking. Amit can tell you all about them.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10938": "How could you not want to be out here on a day like this?",
  "NatsaiOnai_10944": "Must be nice to have a mentor like Professor Fig.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10945": "Professor Fig is a bit of an enigma.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10946": "I would spend all of my time exploring if I could.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10947": "I will say that while I certainly learn a great deal in class, much can be gleaned outside of the castle walls.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10948": "Ha! Enough about me. I would much prefer to talk about you instead –",
  "NatsaiOnai_10951": "Ruins of castles like this are scattered all about the Highlands.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10952": "Did you know that Hogwarts is charmed to look like a crumbling ruin to any Muggles who may pass by?",
  "NatsaiOnai_10955": "How are you settling in? I remember the weeks that followed my arrival feeling quite strange.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10956": "I still miss my homeland, but it is beautiful here too – and getting out of the castle and exploring helped me to adjust quite a bit.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10957": "Hogwarts has become something of a home now, I would say. Hopefully it will for you too.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10958": "When I first arrived, people kept telling me that a large squid lived in the lake. I thought they were joking.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10959": "It is a beautiful view, but I feel – uneasy. Something is different this year.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10962": "Is everything all right, sir?",
  "NatsaiOnai_10963": "Mr Moon is such a character. I wonder what he was ranting about.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10965": "Nearly there.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10966": "And here we are!",
  "NatsaiOnai_10967": "It is hard to know where to start.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10968": "We should move along.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10969": "Shall we continue on?",
  "NatsaiOnai_10970": "Hogsmeade awaits. Shall we?",
  "NatsaiOnai_10971": "You know, the sooner we get to the village the more time we can spend there.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10972": "We should be on our way.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10973": "I am ready to leave whenever you are.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10974": "Though I suppose you would not really call it 'elective' when your mother was the one who elected that you take it.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10976": "I cannot tell you how nice it is to breathe fresh air after being cooped up in Ancient Runes.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10977": "Grave mistake to take it as an elective class, believe me.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10978": "Reminds me of a small river in Matabeleland.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10979": "The sound of the stream is so soothing.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10980": "I often spot lacewing flies in this area.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10981": "Everything was so – new and unfamiliar.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10982": "Mr Moon! He is the Hogwarts caretaker. Looks a bit worse for wear.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10984": "There is much to see outside of the castle walls. Not just Hogsmeade.",
  "NatsaiOnai_10985": "I am happy to explore whenever you'd like. Rumours being what they are about goblins and such, it might be nice to have a friend with you.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11006": "There is not much left to do here. I suppose we should catch up with Professor Binns.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11013": "You can do this!",
  "NatsaiOnai_11025": "This is when I settle in and get comfortable.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11032": "Such a small, small man.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11036": "I believe your friendship to be one of the most important in my life.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11038": "I am very impressed. That took quick thinking.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11048": "In an instant, my father bowed his neck to protect me and was hit.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11060": "I remember reading that the statue of Sir Affpuddle waves at students when they stand in front of it.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11081": " I think we are well past 'interesting' at this point.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11082": "I hope you are prepared to lose this match.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11089": "I am glad that you received my owl. We need to stay low and remain quiet.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11096": "I'm glad to hear it.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11103": "Do you think they will listen to a student? Only Officer Singer can start an investigation. The Ministry will come in later.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11106": "First, we must access the castle keep. I'll check the main gate. See if you can find another way in.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11107": "This charm is stronger than I had thought. They do not want anyone getting in.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11132": "How exciting! (laughs)",
  "NatsaiOnai_11134": "Enough to connect Harlow to the crimes. I shall deliver the letter to Officer Singer. She'll have to do something when she sees it.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11138": "My mother will be worried. I must go. Seek me out soon, I shall have much to tell you.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11141": "Summoned it straight out of Harlow's hands. (laughs)",
  "NatsaiOnai_11142": "(laughs) There was no need to worry. I had it all under control.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11148": "Hello Professor.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11152": "I shall wait here for you.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11154": "Did something catch your eye?",
  "NatsaiOnai_11155": "Now, where were we? Ah, yes –",
  "NatsaiOnai_11156": "So, as I was saying –",
  "NatsaiOnai_11157": "What was I saying? Oh –",
  "NatsaiOnai_11170": "Well done. I will be right up.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11171": "I knew you could do it. This way. I will get the door.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11180": "There you are!",
  "NatsaiOnai_11182": "<i>Alohomora!</i>",
  "NatsaiOnai_11185": "It is frustrating that we do not study Apparition until our sixth year. We could get past this gate instantly.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11187": "Do you know that Hippogriff?",
  "NatsaiOnai_11188": "Very well, new plan. I get the evidence and you free that Hippogriff. Agreed?",
  "NatsaiOnai_11189": "This is our chance – go!",
  "NatsaiOnai_11190": "Hello, my friend. You handled that Mandrake well. It seems charms are not your only forte.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11191": "Well, if you thought the Mandrake was thrilling, wait until you meet the Venomous Tentacula.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11192": "I agree. A spell-casting competition using <i>Accio</i> is much more enjoyable than handling a screaming plant.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11193": "In my experience, Herbology has its uses, but Alchemy is much more exciting – and practical. It was a popular subject at Uagadou.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11195": "Anyway, I meant what I said. From what I have seen, you have a knack for all sorts of magic.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11196": "I can only assume your knack for Herbology rivals the skill you demonstrated in Charms class.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11198": "We shall see each other about, I am sure.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11199": "<i>Finite!</i> – hmm, nothing.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11200": "They will not keep us out. We will get this gate open – somehow.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11206": "Very well, but please hurry. We do not want to get caught.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11207": "Did you find a way into the Gatehouse? Well then, get the gate open! We do not have much time!",
  "NatsaiOnai_11208": "I knew men like him in Uganda. I know how bad things can get if they are not stopped.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11210": "Good. Let us continue.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11211": "See if you can find a way into the Gatehouse. Hopefully the gate controls are there and you can use them to open it.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11216": "Exactly.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11221": "I know there is risk involved, but I feel it is worth it. I am glad you seem to think so too.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11234": "You fought well. You are a good duellist.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11236": "I have seen better fight from Streelers!",
  "NatsaiOnai_11237": "There. It is done.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11238": "I understand –",
  "NatsaiOnai_11248": "I do not like the look of them –",
  "NatsaiOnai_11249": "You need Bitterroot.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11250": "Bitterroot! Eat it.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11251": "There – that should do it.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11259": "They should be in Azkaban –",
  "NatsaiOnai_11261": "That was –",
  "NatsaiOnai_11262": "(laughs) What a spell.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11269": "Such curses are forbidden!",
  "NatsaiOnai_11273": "Look what you have done!",
  "NatsaiOnai_11280": "Your first broom. It should serve its purpose for now.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11281": "Now, that is a broom.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11282": "Will you unlock this?",
  "NatsaiOnai_11283": "I will let you unlock this.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11284": "Curious – a lock.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11339": "They know we are here.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11340": "I hope you are ready for them.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11341": "I am ready – I will stand with you.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11342": "I do not think we were very quiet.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11343": "If it were not for your heavy hooves!",
  "NatsaiOnai_11344": "They have seen us – hurry!",
  "NatsaiOnai_11358": "That should help.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11359": "Does that feel better?",
  "NatsaiOnai_11360": "I am thinking about what they could have here –",
  "NatsaiOnai_11361": "Be careful – I would not want them to find us –",
  "NatsaiOnai_11362": "I do not like this –",
  "NatsaiOnai_11401": "This seems dangerous.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11402": "They do not seem friendly.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11403": "We should stay hidden from them, yes?",
  "NatsaiOnai_11411": "You are an excellent flier.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11412": "Excellent broom.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11414": "Is that a Graphorn?",
  "NatsaiOnai_11415": "A Graphorn? They have the strangest of friends.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11416": "You certainly have a knack for that.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11417": "Only they could befriend a Hippogriff –",
  "NatsaiOnai_11418": "The Bickles family owes us a debt – saving her son –",
  "NatsaiOnai_11419": "I am glad those Hippogriffs are finally safe –",
  "NatsaiOnai_11420": "I am very grateful that you saved Isko and I – that was quite frightening.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11421": "People are starting to find out about Rookwood being sent to Azkaban – good.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11423": "Sallow is in detention again.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11424": "It is a shame that Anne Sallow's family took her out of school.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11425": "I would be careful of Ominis Gaunt if I were you – I think he is interested in Dark Magic.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11442": "I like your pyjamas.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11443": "I cannot imagine that Imelda is too pleased at being bested.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11464": "Since you seem very close, my mother and I were wondering – what does Professor Fig teach?",
  "NatsaiOnai_11465": "Please accept my condolences. I know how hard it is to lose someone close to you.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11468": "Goblins attacking Hogwarts – and my mother thought Scotland would be safe.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11493": "But I think he, of all people, would understand my persistence. My father never shied away from a fight for good, no matter how ruthless the foe.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11494": "He – and my mother – raised me to believe that it is a privilege to be able to fight for those who cannot.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11495": "He was. Truly extraordinary. And thank you for your kind words.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11496": "You, my fellow traveller, have enriched my time at Hogwarts beyond anything I could have imagined. Thank you.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11504": "And it is in my gazelle form that I have been able to wander the Highlands rather freely until now. Much to my mother's chagrin.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11505": "Animagi are not born. The process is quite elaborate. It involves holding a Mandrake leaf in one's mouth for an entire month.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11506": "Well, the first time, it can be a bit unnerving. I felt a kind of searing pain and a strong double heartbeat.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11507": "But it gets easier the more you do it. I no longer feel any pain and I must say, I find a sense of comfort in the double heartbeat.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11510": "Then placing the leaf in a crystal phial so that it is imbued with moonlight. Then adding one of your own hairs.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11511": "And that is just the beginning. Self-Transfiguration is common among students at Uagadou. But Professor Weasley considers it much too dangerous to teach at Hogwarts.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11512": "Oh, no. A person's Animagus form is determined by their personality.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11513": "My mother is convinced that my form is a gazelle because I adapt well to any situation.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11514": "I believe it is because I can sense danger and keep my wits about me.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11517": "<i>Alohomora!</i>",
  "NatsaiOnai_11518": "Nice one!",
  "NatsaiOnai_11519": "Well done!",
  "NatsaiOnai_11520": "Watch your back!",
  "NatsaiOnai_11533": "(ululating)",
  "NatsaiOnai_11534": "I know who I would want by my side in a crisis – whether it involves battling Dark wizards or confronting a ferocious vegetable.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11544": "A dark and mysterious manor? We should find out what happened there. Shall we investigate?",
  "NatsaiOnai_11545": "We can get out of this. But be prepared for anything.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11553": "I know, Mother.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11554": "Yes, Mother. I feel fine, and it will do me good to see my friend.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11565": "Clear. Here we go.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11566": "I am in the lead.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11570": "You must be eager to have your own things again – and to see the village.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11572": "Not at all. Professor Weasley tells me that you need to go to Hogsmeade.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11573": "I was glad Professor Weasley asked me to accompany you.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11574": "Yes. I had planned to extend an invitation to you myself. I thought you might enjoy a Butterbeer in the village.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11575": "The timing of Professor Weasley's owl was perfect.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11578": "I heard rumours that Hippogriffs had been spotted nearby.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11584": "Look. From the Forbidden Forest – Hippogriffs! I wonder if something startled them.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11595": "Good. Shall we set off? I intend to give you a first-rate Hogsmeade experience.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11640": "We should walk around a bit more. Perhaps today is the day I finally pick one.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11641": "Experience Hogsmeade at your own pace. We can meet up in the town circle when you are finished.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11647": "Enjoy yourself! I will see you soon.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11648": "Professor Weasley said that you need to get potion recipes, spellcrafts, some seeds and – ?",
  "NatsaiOnai_11652": "The Three Broomsticks is the place for Butterbeer and you can get any sweet you can imagine at Honeydukes.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11653": "I could not choose a favourite shop here. It changes with every visit.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11663": "There you are. Did you find what you needed?",
  "NatsaiOnai_11666": "Of course! You will enjoy Mr Ollivander. And I am keen to see what you will do with a wand of your own.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11667": "Uagadou's history is, well, a bit different than that of Hogwarts – to say the least.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11692": "That is the main keep. My guess is that we'll find Harlow and the letter inside.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11694": "We'll need to be careful once we get –",
  "NatsaiOnai_11695": "I can tell you that you are certain to find everything you need in Hogsmeade.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11707": "Aaiiee!",
  "NatsaiOnai_11715": "I do not see any guards, but we should still try to be as quiet as possible. Harlow is here after all.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11716": "Meet me near the ruins of Falbarton Castle. After dark. Do not tell anyone.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11722": "And I love being able to view the world from a different perspective.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11730": "What did, Mr Moon?",
  "NatsaiOnai_11755": "Aaaaaah!",
  "NatsaiOnai_11756": "This is amazing!",
  "NatsaiOnai_11757": "Whooooooooooo!",
  "NatsaiOnai_11759": "What an extraordinary introduction to Hogsmeade. I would say that we – and you in particular – have earned at least one Butterbeer.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11760": "I am well, but I have been worried about you, my friend – with Ranrok and Rookwood and Harlow after you.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11765": "Took me weeks to become proficient with <i>Accio</i>.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11766": "I transferred here from Uagadou just before my fourth year.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11767": "Until next time.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11768": "This 'Grimbald Weft' sounds like a helpful fellow. But a hero of the rebellion? Hmmm.",
  "NatsaiOnai_11769": "Perhaps a bit gentler?",
  "NatsaiOnai_13000": "Are you ready to put an end to Harlow?",
  "NatsaiOnai_13001": "Hopefully by the time you return, I will be able to move a bit more freely.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13002": "Did they see us?",
  "NatsaiOnai_13003": "What was that goblin doing with Victor Rookwood?",
  "NatsaiOnai_13004": "The goblin from the <i>Daily Prophet</i>? I knew I'd seen him somewhere!",
  "NatsaiOnai_13005": "Quickly. Let's get inside the Three Broomsticks.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13023": "I sense he is close.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13026": "I don't know, but – what other choice did I have? You were in danger.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13028": "Are you ready to finish Harlow?",
  "NatsaiOnai_13029": "(nervous yell)",
  "NatsaiOnai_13030": "(surprised gasp) (nervous breaths)",
  "NatsaiOnai_13034": "I must learn more about Mr Bickle's friends and why Harlow is after them.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13035": "You'll be hearing from me as soon as I know something.  Thank you for your help today.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13043": "Self-Transfiguration is not taught at Hogwarts. So, I am 'gently discouraged' from practising it. However – I am an Animagus.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13044": "It is. I love transforming, but Mother is less enthusiastic about it.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13048": "So frustrating.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13055": "We need to know how they are being blackmailed by Rookwood and Harlow.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13056": "We need to know how they are being blackmailed by Harlow.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13062": "We are making progress, and we will succeed.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13063": "Thank you again for saving me. You deserve all of the praise you have received.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13066": "I – what does that mean?",
  "NatsaiOnai_13067": "Is that the magic you used fighting the trolls in Hogsmeade?",
  "NatsaiOnai_13071": "I will say that I have never seen him in such a state.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13076": "Look out!",
  "NatsaiOnai_13077": "Watch out!",
  "NatsaiOnai_13078": "What was that?",
  "NatsaiOnai_13079": "I like it! Do more of it!",
  "NatsaiOnai_13080": "Keep at it! We have to wear him down!",
  "NatsaiOnai_13081": "Look! He's faltering!",
  "NatsaiOnai_13082": "We need to make sure he stays that way!",
  "NatsaiOnai_13083": "I will see what he wants.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13084": "I think so. We shall see who shows up.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13085": "I know, Sebastian. I know.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13086": "And then he was gone. And it was all my fault.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13087": "A few years later, we left to come to Scotland.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13088": "He died protecting me. If I had been capable of protecting myself, he would still be alive today.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13089": "My mother and I tried to go on without him, but it became too much for us there.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13090": "He should still be here, and it's my fault that he isn't.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13091": "I have learned of a wizard who is being harassed by Harlow. He may be able to provide the evidence we need to take Harlow down. We should speak with him together. Meet me at his home.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13092": "Good game back there! I must admit, I think I underestimated you.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13093": "My mother received an offer to teach Divination here.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13094": "Before I knew it, we had left Uganda and were halfway around the world at a new school in a new country.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13095": "Uagadou School of Magic is the largest wizarding school in the world. So, yes. Bigger than Hogwarts.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13096": "But it never seemed intimidating or overwhelming to me. It always felt like home.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13097": "Its address is 'Mountains of the Moon.' It is not so much a castle as a beautiful edifice carved out of the mountainside.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13098": "I remember the first time I saw it. The mist was so thick I could hardly make out anything at all.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13099": "And then it just materialised before me, this enormous school that seemed to be floating in mid-air.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13100": "Hmm. Mostly, yes. But I did have to learn how to use a wand when I arrived here. Hardly anyone at Uagadou uses one.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13101": "Oh, yes.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13102": "No, no, not at all. Wizarding magic cast without a wand is just as powerful.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13103": "I find wandless magic to be much more instinctive. Not to mention quite convenient if one is without their wand.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13104": "I must admit, however, that I am growing quite fond of using a wand. It seems very dramatic.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13105": "Thank you for asking. I do miss Uagadou, but I am glad to be here at Hogwarts.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13106": "Ah, I think Professor Ronen wants to talk to you. Better not keep him waiting.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13107": "Hello! Looking for me?",
  "NatsaiOnai_13108": "Ohhh!",
  "NatsaiOnai_13109": "We were just talking about you!",
  "NatsaiOnai_13110": "Everyone has been talking about you defending Hogsmeade from that troll attack.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13111": "And I shall never forget watching Sirona stand up to Rookwood and Harlow in the Three Broomsticks.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13112": "Both of you have inspired me to take a stand of my own.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13113": "I am well, thank you. I was there – and saw what happened with Rookwood and Harlow at the Three Broomsticks. I have been worried about you.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13114": "I realised something that day in Hogsmeade.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13115": "You displayed such courage fighting that troll. And Sirona wasn't intimidated one bit by Rookwood and Harlow.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13119": "I am not going to sit by and watch them destroy my new home.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13134": "In the meantime, remember: I am here if you need me.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13136": "It is. And I will have more questions.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13143": "As promised, I did some investigating to find out what Harlow is up to. I followed him to the Hog's Head.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13145": "That letter is the tangible proof that Officer Singer needs. It is why I followed Harlow here and why I wrote to you. I need your help to retrieve it.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13161": "I will say I did not expect to see him cast the Killing Curse at us. He won't forget this. Be on your guard.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13162": "Poppy will be relieved to know that Highwing's safe. I came to the right person for help.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13163": "Now, tell me, where did you meet these Hippogriffs?",
  "NatsaiOnai_13164": "Poppy Sweeting knows a Hippogriff? (chuckling) Of course she does.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13166": "That Rookwood's looking for a phoenix. Not sure where he will find one. (chuckling) But it also included Harlow's orders to inspect that castle for the poachers.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13176": "Men like Rookwood and Harlow are the reason my mother and I left Matabeleland.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13177": "Rumour has it that Theophilus Harlow runs Rookwood's day-to-day operations.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13178": "Taking him down would cripple Rookwood's entire enterprise.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13179": "I spoke with her. She was polite, but perhaps understandably would not discuss details with a student.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13180": "I overheard some of Rookwood's lot talking about a massive poaching operation that Harlow is planning.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13181": "I was thinking that we could investigate a bit. Try to get the evidence that Officer Singer needs.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13183": "I am going to watch and listen. Find out precisely what Harlow is up to. I shall reach out when I know more.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13185": "I had heard they were seen in Hogsmeade together.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13187": "All the more reason they must be stopped.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13188": "If you don't mind my asking, why were they looking for you?",
  "NatsaiOnai_13189": "We did not speak about it at the time, but I am hoping now you might tell me why they were looking for you.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13190": "Hmm. A bit odd – the two of them pursuing a Hogwarts student so intently.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13191": "For now, it is safe to say that Rookwood and Harlow are a threat to both of us – to all of us. Which is why I wanted to speak to you.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13192": "But whatever the reason, you were clearly in danger.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13193": "When I took the letter we found to Officer Singer, she told me about Mr Bickle.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13194": "He had been doing the same thing we are – providing Officer Singer with evidence to take down Harlow.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13195": "I had hoped to speak with him about what he had found, but – we were too late.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13197": "I found comfort in it. I still do. I think those of us who have witnessed death deserve some comfort.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13199": "He was likely running from Harlow – distracted.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13200": "I was with my father when he died. My mother was away, and I felt quite helpless.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13201": "My father was a wonderful man. I – ",
  "NatsaiOnai_13204": "I thought we would have found Archie by now.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13207": "Men like Harlow would not think twice about killing a child. We must find Archie quickly.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13208": "She thanked me, but she clearly felt that it was not enough.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13209": "It is a shame that Hippogriffs cannot speak. Your friend Highwing could provide all the evidence against Harlow that we need.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13210": "We will need something more.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13214": "It is specific to me. (sigh) I am the 'unusual creature' in Hogsmeade she mentioned.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13215": "That is how I have managed to spy on Rookwood and Harlow.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13216": "She says that no creature – especially one as rare as a gazelle – should be bounding about where poaching has become so prevalent.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13217": "(sigh) She claims that she has foreseen tragedy befall me in my gazelle form.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13218": "But she has used her Sight to control me too many times. I no longer believe it.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13219": "I agree. I have never considered quitting – even for a moment.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13220": "You could have fled the moment you discovered that Rookwood, Harlow and Ranrok were after you, but you did not.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13221": "I choose to act as you have. I must deal with Rookwood and Harlow, not hide from them.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13222": "I choose to act as you have. I must deal with Harlow, not hide from him.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13223": "My mother cannot know where I am all the time.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13224": "That may be safe, but I do not believe that it would be best. Do you?",
  "NatsaiOnai_13226": "I am allowed to leave the castle. I am always careful, Mother.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13227": "But, Mother –",
  "NatsaiOnai_13228": "If someone had 'meddled' in Matabeleland, Father would still be with us!",
  "NatsaiOnai_13229": "This may be a good time for <i>Revelio</i> again.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13230": "We must discover which way he went. <i>Revelio</i> will show us his path.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13231": "He would not have done this to his own hideout. Someone came here looking for him.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13233": "We must gather information from the friends of Mr Bickle that Archie and Mrs Bickle mentioned –",
  "NatsaiOnai_13234": "They may know what evidence Mr Bickle had against Harlow, or they may have evidence of their own.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13236": "I suggest that you speak with each of them, while I head to the Hog's Head. I saw some Ashwinders heading there –",
  "NatsaiOnai_13237": "– and as my mother would never go near the Hog’s Head, she is less likely to learn of my activities than if I were to wander the village questioning its residents.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13241": "I do not know about Mr Rabe, but his wife, Daisy, is often in Hogsmeade, as is Agabus Philbert.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13242": "And Otto Dibble – he works at Gladrags so you will likely find him there.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13243": "Meet me here after you have spoken with them.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13244": "Of course.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13247": "Be prepared for a fight. These Ashwinders must pay.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13248": "Let's find Officer Singer and put an end to Harlow once and for all.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13258": "My mother will not like this. Thank you again for rescuing me. We shall speak soon.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13261": "You may not realise it, but you are the talk of the school since you saved me that day.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13262": "I told my mother in the hope that she would be more forgiving of what I have been up to if it came from me.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13263": "She likely told other professors, and – news travels quickly.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13264": "Unfortunately, she might, in fact, have been even less forgiving than I'd hoped.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13265": "She has not. Harlow is as strong as ever. Someone needs to stop him. Whether it is us or Officer Singer.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13275": "There are times when my father's absence drifts to the back of my mind, and I feel peace for a day or two.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13276": "But this is not one of those times. I miss him. I miss running with him. I miss Matabeleland.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13277": "You have done plenty. In fact, many of my good days are good because of you.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13278": "I find myself reliving the moment more often than I would like.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13279": "I believe I would feel less helpless if I could truly put an end to Harlow and the rest of Rookwood's miserable lot.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13280": "The bad days, however –",
  "NatsaiOnai_13281": "That is what my mother says. But he died protecting me, and I cannot help but feel guilty over that.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13282": "– and Ranrok! You've done a great deal of good that is a benefit to all.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13283": "With Harlow on the prowl, there can be no real peace. Each day he remains free, he does more damage, leaving people like Archie Bickle to suffer the consequences.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13284": "And that will benefit many for years to come.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13292": "I received an owl from Mrs Bickle. She wondered if we were having any luck going after Harlow. Suggested we could gather evidence from a friend near Manor Cape.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13296": "Precisely.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13302": "If he thinks we are aware of his plans, he may call off the ambush. We should behave as he expects us to.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13303": "Brilliant!",
  "NatsaiOnai_13310": "Harlow's reign ends today.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13312": "And – one other thing. Harlow mentioned you to his colleagues. They did not mistake you for someone else, did they?",
  "NatsaiOnai_13313": "And after you told me that Rookwood and Harlow were after you, I decided that you were the perfect person to join me in taking them down – for good.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13314": "Why did you lie to me? And what do they want with a Hogwarts student?",
  "NatsaiOnai_13315": "When were you at Gringotts?",
  "NatsaiOnai_13323": "I do not know. We should look around.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13324": "I am doing better than it appears. I am only here because my mother insisted – just to be safe.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13325": "I was relieved when she told me that you were all right.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13326": "The moment that I saw Harlow aim his wand at you, well –",
  "NatsaiOnai_13328": "I did what I had to, and I would do it again. I could not simply stand there and let you get hurt.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13329": "Of course not. There was nothing that you –",
  "NatsaiOnai_13330": "Oh. Oh, my. I cannot believe it took me this long to see it.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13331": "That's very kind of you to say. I hope that you are right.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13333": "But we have done it. Rookwood is dead, Harlow is on his way to Azkaban and the rest of them are on the run.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13334": "A few of the dregs will still be about, fighting for their lost cause, but Rookwood's enterprise has fallen apart.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13335": "Thank you, but we make a formidable team.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13337": "Oh, no! Is someone stuck in that well?",
  "NatsaiOnai_13338": "We should take a closer look at that tree. I think it's the one from that map you found in the well.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13339": "We should look around.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13343": "I have never followed floating candles into the Forbidden Forest, but I have spent a bit of time here. Keep your wits about you.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13344": "Well done! The forest is full of surprises.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13345": "I am ready to follow the map if you are.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13346": "Don't let Augustus Hill see you in that. He'll think you have been shopping elsewhere.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13347": "I wonder if those are meant to mark something.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13350": "We are stronger than Harlow, and he knows it. That's why he's resorting to this sort of trickery. We must go.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13358": "<i>Revelio</i> may be our only hope of finding out which way he went.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13359": "If it is Harlow that's pursuing him, I only hope you're right.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13360": "I believe so. He supposedly has evidence against Harlow. We need to speak with him.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13361": "A fork in the road. We will need <i>Revelio</i> again.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13362": "Multiple sets of footprints. Harlow caught up to him here. This is not good.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13363": "I did not expect this tent to be so large on the inside. That complicates things a little.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13379": "You wanted to speak with me, Mother?",
  "NatsaiOnai_13380": "Your message mentioned your concern about an unusual creature that was spotted in the woods near Hogsmeade.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13381": "That could have been anything.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13382": "My mother would like to speak with me. I believe she has learned about some of what we've been up to. I am hoping she may be easier on me if you are there.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13393": "Ashwinders! We were right!",
  "NatsaiOnai_13394": "She never listens to me.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13396": "They went this way. ",
  "NatsaiOnai_13397": "Mrs Bickle said that her son's hideout is south of the hamlet, in the forest.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13410": "– Agabus Philbert, Otto Dibble and Mr and Mrs Rabe.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13411": "We simply need to know whatever they know.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13418": "We shall have to keep a look out for more of these. I wonder how many there are.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13419": "Would you please meet with me in the Great Hall? I have come upon a difficult time, and I need a friend.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13420": "Some days are more difficult than others.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13424": "I do not believe it did. Harlow intends to ambush us.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13425": "Keep an eye out. Harlow is likely around here somewhere.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13430": "It is good to see you, my friend.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13431": "As the Ashwinders were locking me up and threatening my life, it did occur to me that my mother may have been right.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13432": "If she knew any more about what I've done, she would never let me out of her sight again.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13433": "Soon, you and I will put an end to the Ashwinders, beginning with Harlow.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13434": "Soon, you and I will put an end to the Ashwinders. Rookwood is already gone. Harlow will be next.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13435": "And once he is gone, we will turn our attention to Rookwood.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13436": "Each day they remain free, they do more damage, leaving people like Archie Bickle to suffer the consequences.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13441": "Thank you. I believe we will get them. Beginning with Harlow.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13446": "What on earth?",
  "NatsaiOnai_13447": "I – what does that mean?",
  "NatsaiOnai_13448": "Is that the magic you used fighting the trolls in Hogsmeade?",
  "NatsaiOnai_13449": "It is. And I will have more questions.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13450": "For now, it's safe to say that Rookwood and Harlow are a threat to both of us – to all of us. And we can help to take them down – for good.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13452": "I already sent her an owl to let her know that we were 'following a lead' given to us by Mrs Bickle.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13454": "I cannot tell you how thrilled I am that we were finally able to defeat Harlow.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13455": "This has all been a bit much, hasn't it?",
  "NatsaiOnai_13456": "Knowing that he is locked in a cell in Azkaban makes all that we have been through worthwhile.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13457": "Safer, yes – but now we must deal with Victor Rookwood.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13458": "I suppose I will need to be released from the hospital wing first.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13462": "I suppose it was instinct, yes. I could not simply stand there and let you get hurt.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13468": "You are the talk of the school since you saved Mr Rabe and I from the Ashwinders. We have come so far. We should discuss the next steps in our plan to stop Harlow.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13469": "Ah, I have been meaning to speak with you.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13471": "You found us! I knew you would realise I had left my wand for you. Speak to Mr Rabe. He will tell you what you need to do.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13472": "Of course, you have put an end to Rookwood!",
  "NatsaiOnai_13473": "Indeed she will. But, so be it. I am tired of hiding it from her.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13475": "I shall pursue them until they are finished. And I think she knows that – as do you.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13476": "My mother needs to understand that I will not be safe from the Ashwinders until everyone is.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13477": "An enchanted well and a tree full of treasure. I told  you it was good to get out of the castle now and then.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13478": "You are here. Good.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13487": "Thank you. I believe we will get him.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13488": "I wonder if anyone can see us from the castle.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13489": "Poor Adelaide – she's very worried. I will gladly help to search for Mr Oakes.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13490": "Adelaide mentioned her uncle Rowland's camp may lie near Brocburrow – past the river.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13491": "If this is Mr Oakes's campsite, we're in for trouble.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13492": "Should we be bold or discreet? There is more than one way to enter.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13493": "If Mr Oakes was here, there is no sign of him now.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13494": "Oakes is an experienced trader. He marked that map for a reason.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13495": "His journal left behind? This cannot be good.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13496": "I know this castle. I can't believe it's been taken over by Loyalists.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13497": "A part of me had hoped it would be more cheerful on the inside.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13498": "Boiler doors usually need to be lit to operate. This one is probably no exception.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13499": "That furnace could be promising.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13500": "Try lighting that furnace. It must be connected to the boiler door.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13501": "I saw a boiler door on our way down. Perhaps we should take a closer look there.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13516": "We have got some spectators. The trials are popular.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13517": "I noticed him reading a letter. All I could see was that it was signed by and bore the seal of Victor Rookwood.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13519": "Mr Oakes was lucky. Ranrok's lot would never have freed him.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13520": "I saw movement higher up in the keep. We should find our way there.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13521": "A ladder – that's what we need.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13533": "We need to find the tomb near Brocburrow and place Samantha's family crest on a sarcophagus there.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13534": "Seems our feet have not been cursed. That is a good sign, I suppose.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13535": "I was not expecting to find a troll here. Although I should not be surprised.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13536": "Samantha will be glad to hear that the crest has been returned. I certainly hope it reverses the curse.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13537": "I suppose we know what happened to Mary Portman now. She was breeding the spiders.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13538": "This must be Aranshire. We had better keep an eye out for spiders.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13539": "A ladder. Not sure I want to know where this leads.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13540": "That is the last of the spider sacs.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13541": "I hope that's the last spider.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13542": "Well done. I believe it is dead.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13559": "Be on your guard.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13568": "I do not like you using spells like that.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13569": "Do you need some help?",
  "NatsaiOnai_13570": "Feel better?",
  "NatsaiOnai_13571": "Is there a reason you are breaking things?",
  "NatsaiOnai_13572": "Should I be breaking things too?",
  "NatsaiOnai_13573": "Are you having a bad day?",
  "NatsaiOnai_13574": "I assume you have a good reason for breaking that.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13575": "Oh, you startled me.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13576": "What was that for?",
  "NatsaiOnai_13577": "Why are you doing this?",
  "NatsaiOnai_13578": "That is a fine broom you have.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13604": "Remind me not to challenge you to a duel.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13628": "They got what they deserved.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13629": "Good riddance.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13630": "That's the last of them.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13631": "Another spider squashed.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13632": "Battling trolls is hard work.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13657": "Should we attack?",
  "NatsaiOnai_13658": "Be wary. This could turn into a fight.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13659": "They are everywhere. Be careful.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13660": "Hold on! I am coming to help you!",
  "NatsaiOnai_13670": "Who does not love to speed by on a broom?",
  "NatsaiOnai_13671": "I knew you could ride a Hippogriff, but I did not expect to see you on a Graphorn!",
  "NatsaiOnai_13672": "Hippogriffs are such majestic creatures. Thanks to you I understand the joy of flying on one.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13673": "Professor Fig died a hero – nothing more honourable than that.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13675": "Why would trolls attack Hogsmeade? What were they after?",
  "NatsaiOnai_13676": "I could not have imagined Ranrok and his Loyalists could drill into Hogwarts.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13677": "Do not do that.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13678": "I do not like it when you use Dark magic.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13679": "Why would you use that spell?",
  "NatsaiOnai_13680": "You should not use Dark Magic.",
  "NatsaiOnai_13684": "Look out!",
  "NatsaiOnai_13710": "Oh – hello my friend!",
  "NatsaiOnai_13711": "Good to see you.",

  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10222": "Oh, going on 400 years now!",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10223": "I tell you, her teeth have never been straighter.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10224": "Henry the Seventh. Now the eighth, that's a story –",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10225": "Forty-five hacks, not one less!",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10226": "Oh, terrible nickname. I despise it.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10227": "All the way from Dorset. Only took the train.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10228": "Ah, now this year's are a lovely lot. Except some of the fifth-years.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10229": "I wouldn't believe it either, had it not gone straight through me.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10230": "There's always one, isn't there?",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10231": "They always want to know. And the truth is, I simply can't explain. None of us can.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10237": "Do stay behind me. It's Sir Patrick we want.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10238": "Hello Sir Amset. Do let us pass. We've brought a little something for Sir Patrick.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10239": "All in good fun! Once Sir Patrick lets me join the Headless Hunt I'll be right there with them. This offering is sure to win him over.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10240": "Rest assured, you'll have your information from young Jackdaw in no time, wherever he may be.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10241": "How about the next best thing, Sir Patrick?",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10242": "Eh, we've brought you a gift.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10243": "It's Richard Jackdaw. Where can we find him?  May we speak to him?",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10244": "Oh, sir, you jest.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10270": "Why are you leaving empty-handed? Has the beef not gone off yet?",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10271": "Leaving so soon? You haven't got the rotten roast beef.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10272": "Trust me, where we're going, we'll need that rotten beef.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10278": "The Headless Hunt wouldn't hurt a fly, let alone a student. Just a group of fun-loving headless ghosts.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10279": "We shall meet Sir Patrick and the Headless Hunt in the dead of night at the Hogsmeade graveyard. That beef is our key.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10280": "I know about the book you found and its missing pages. I may be able to help.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10300": "Uh, sir, there's another matter I wish to discuss with you, if I may.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10301": "But sir, I –",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10302": "Farewell, my young friend. Perhaps your luck with these chaps will be better than mine.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10311": "That is correct. Rotten roast beef.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10317": "Follow me, if you will. It's not too far.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10318": "I'd be happy to take you to him – if you'd be so kind as to perform a small favour for me along the way.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10319": "If one floats through it just right, one can almost taste it.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10320": "Yes. It's nothing, really. I'd be grateful if you could simply go into the kitchen and procure a little rotten roast beef.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10321": "Ah. You're back. No trouble, I take it?",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10322": "It's simple, my young friend. My ghostly form cannot carry it.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10323": "Here we are. Tickle the pear and head on in.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10324": "I am already imagining the sweet aroma of rotten roast beef.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10325": "It's nothing, really. I'd be grateful if you could simply pop into the kitchen and procure a bit of rotten roast beef.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10326": "This may be a leap, but I believe I know who ended up with those pages.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10327": "Yes. In the painting. I'll wait right here. Do try not to get in the way of the house-elves.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10328": "Yes. Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, at your service.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10329": "Indeed I was.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10330": "You there. Yes, you. I wonder if you might come with me for a moment.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10331": "Now, if you'd be so kind as to collect the roast beef, I shall explain everything else in due course.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10332": "Glad to hear it. Kind elf, Feenky.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10333": "Now, let's get that beef to Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore and you'll be one step closer to finding those pages.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10335": "Terribly sorry. I'm getting ahead of myself.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10336": "Sir Patrick organises the Headless Hunt – a group of headless ghosts who gather for various, er, headless activities.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10337": "Yes. You'll see. Anyway, I don't know how, but a member of that hunt, Richard Jackdaw, had the pages when he was alive.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10338": "My plan is to take the rotten roast beef to Sir Patrick so that he'll allow me – us – to engage with the hunt and speak to Jackdaw.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10339": "Shall we?",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10340": "Wonderful. You won't regret it.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10341": "Ready?",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10342": "It is, in a way. You see, I've been trying to gain access to the hunt for quite some time.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10343": "Offering the beef to Sir Patrick may help me in that regard. While, of course, also helping you.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10344": "I'm certain they will be welcoming to you, however – in no small part due to the rotten roast beef you will come bearing.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10346": "Allow me to do the talking. They can be a rather supercilious lot.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10347": "Marvellous! Simply marvellous! I've never seen the Headmaster so regal.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10348": "Actually I have come to think of it. His way really, isn't it?",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10349": "You wouldn't mind having a little sweep over mine would you?",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10350": "Yes, yes of course, I'm familiar. It's just that – there have been attempts over the years to dust my statue.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10351": "But no one has ever cared enough to do the task properly.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10352": "Yes all right. No need to pile it on. Anything to do with the Bloody Baron always looks impeccable.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10353": "And Helena and the Fat Friar. But me, I'm left – dusty.  Nearly Dusted Nick.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10354": "Yes, no need to dwell. Scrope, I'm certain the Headmaster wouldn't mind.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10355": "Are you saying that to annoy me? Oh beheading servants, yes, I see your point. Never mind!",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10356": "Choose your battles, I say! I shall be polished another day!",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10357": "Word gets around amongst the ghosts. You were spotted with Mr Sallow in the Restricted Section.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10358": "Don't worry, your secret's safe with me.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10359": "You're sure to turn some heads dressed like that.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10364": "Dark Arts are best kept far outside the castle walls.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10378": "I can't say I ever thought Ranrok stood much of a chance. Just a lot of bluster and noise.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10385": "Now really, was that necessary?",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10392": "I beg your pardon.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10399": "Don't think your nocturnal activities go unnoticed. The eyes of Hogwarts never sleep. (yawn)",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10402": "One can't be too careful after dark.",
  "NearlyHeadlessNick_10405": "Ah, the good ol' days. Oh to have a hand in a bit of harmless destruction.",

  "NellieOggspire_10889": "Well, you turned out to be something of a hero, didn't you?",
  "NellieOggspire_10890": "Ever since she arrived, everyone's been raving about how Natty is 'so talented'. After seeing her today, it appears they're right.",
  "NellieOggspire_10891": "Don't mind me. I find it helpful to change my point of view now and again. Put things – in perspective.",
  "NellieOggspire_10895": " I'm Nellie, by the way. Nellie Oggspire. I've heard rumours about what happened to you on your way to Hogwarts. Is it true? About the dragon?",
  "NellieOggspire_10896": "Crikey! I can't believe it! How thrilling! And also terrifying.",
  "NellieOggspire_10898": "How awful for you. And of course, that poor man from the Ministry.",
  "NellieOggspire_10899": "Anyway, you've certainly brought some much-needed excitement to Gryffindor – and Hogwarts, for that matter.",
  "NellieOggspire_10902": "You never know. Bye for now.",
  "NellieOggspire_10906": "Well, hello!",
  "NellieOggspire_10907": "Er, that you escaped a dragon attack. Isn't that enough?",
  "NellieOggspire_10908": "Hm. It's something I've always done. Since I was little. My mother once found me on the roof when I was five. Still has no idea how I got there.",
  "NellieOggspire_10910": "Once I made it to the top of Gryffindor Tower. From the outside. Without a broom.",
  "NellieOggspire_10911": "But – still. You got to see a dragon.",
  "NellieOggspire_10912": "But, with all the strange hallways and rooms in the castle, and everything lurking in and outside the grounds, you don't need to scale a tower to see something incredible here.",
  "NellieOggspire_10916": "Goodness, no. And I've never heard of one attacking a carriage like that. Not enough meat in a carriage, I'd think.",
  "NellieOggspire_10919": "I'll say. I think you've already earned a reputation for fearlessness.",
  "NellieOggspire_10920": "Shame it's over. I was just getting started.",
  "NellieOggspire_10921": "Were you able to follow one of the Daedalian Keys?",
  "NellieOggspire_10922": "Brilliant. What did you find in the cabinet?",
  "NellieOggspire_10924": "I call them 'house chests'. I've seen the one in Gryffindor and heard they're also in the other common rooms as well. Keep an eye out.",
  "NellieOggspire_10925": "Looks like some sort of house token. I bet it unlocks house chests!",
  "NellieOggspire_10926": "Looks like a Gryffindor house token. I bet it unlocks our house chest!",
  "NellieOggspire_10927": "I do hope you continue on. For so much effort the prize must be something grand.",
  "NellieOggspire_10933": "Most of us arrive via train or boat – not having just escaped the jaws of a dragon! Of course it's got people talking.",
  "NellieOggspire_10937": "Why is everyone so highly strung? It's perfectly safe. ",
  "NellieOggspire_10938": "Word travels fast at Hogwarts.",
  "NellieOggspire_10939": "The Daedalian Keys are back. Aren't they brilliant?",
  "NellieOggspire_10940": "The Daedalian Keys are back!",
  "NellieOggspire_10941": "The Daedalian Keys. Surely you've seen them flying about.",
  "NellieOggspire_10942": "I hope you do! In fact, I think I heard one of the keys in the Astronomy Tower. You should listen for them.",
  "NellieOggspire_10943": "You should try to catch one.",
  "NellieOggspire_10944": "If you can manage to get the key into the cabinet lock – not an easy task – you may find a reward.",
  "NellieOggspire_10945": "Rumour is that a former headmistress, Professor Mole, conjured them to protect the contents of certain locked cabinets years ago.",
  "NellieOggspire_10946": "Professor Black couldn't be bothered to disenchant the keys and they appear every few years.",
  "NellieOggspire_10949": "What I heard is that it had something to do with keeping Peeves out of things. But that may or may not be true.",
  "NellieOggspire_10952": "Yes! I'm sorry, I'm just – I'm Nellie, by the way. I'm just so excited that the Daedalian Keys are back.",
  "NellieOggspire_10953": "Ugh. I've tried and I can't even get past the first cabinets.",
  "NellieOggspire_10954": "Perhaps you'll have better luck. I'd love to know what's in the cabinets.",
  "NellieOggspire_10955": "I hope you follow a few keys at least. If you manage to open a cabinet, I'd love to know what you find – if anything.",
  "NellieOggspire_10957": "When you spot or hear a flying key, you're to follow it back to its cabinet. Inserting it in the lock is the tricky part.",
  "NellieOggspire_10958": "I hope you follow some. If you open a cabinet, I'd love to know what you find – if anything.",
  "NellieOggspire_10959": "Each key will lead you to a locked cabinet somewhere in the castle.",
  "NellieOggspire_10960": "He's a poltergeist. I thought they could go almost anywhere!",
  "NellieOggspire_10969": "Sir Nicholas, our house ghost, is looking for you. You can find him near the Great Hall.",
  "NellieOggspire_10970": "I'll wait here until it's over. No sense in getting hit by a stray wand blast.",
  "NellieOggspire_10971": "You won't take the title!",
  "NellieOggspire_10972": "Oh! Wonderful! What did you find?",
  "NellieOggspire_10973": "Brilliant! Well, thank you for solving that mystery for me. I always wondered what those keys would lead to.",
  "NellieOggspire_10974": "Oh! Wonderful! What did you find?",
  "NellieOggspire_10975": "Brilliant! Well, thank you for solving that mystery for me. I always wondered what those keys would lead to.",
  "NellieOggspire_10976": "I call them 'house chests'. I've seen the one in our common room, and heard they are also in the other common rooms. Keep an eye out.",
  "NellieOggspire_10977": "Surely you can go faster than that.",
  "NellieOggspire_10978": "Riding a Graphorn? Why didn't I think of that?",
  "NellieOggspire_10979": "I'm going to do that one day. All I need is a Hippogriff.",
  "NellieOggspire_10980": "Why are you in your night clothes? I hope Black doesn't see you.",
  "NellieOggspire_10981": "I can't believe Professor Fig's gone – that he gave his life as he did.",
  "NellieOggspire_10982": "Wish I hadn't missed the trolls in the village. I could have definitely taken one on.",
  "NellieOggspire_10983": "Those Loyalists have been awful all year. Such a relief that they've been dealt with.",
  "NellieOggspire_10984": "What you did in Crossed Wands was fantastic! Your duelling skills are quite advanced.",
  "NellieOggspire_10985": "The Dark Arts shouldn't be toyed with. You can't possibly know what you're doing.",
  "NellieOggspire_10986": "Question is, do I want to know what you're up to?",
  "NellieOggspire_10988": "What are you playing at?",
  "NellieOggspire_10989": "Oh, pardon me.",
  "NellieOggspire_10990": "Having a bit of fun, are we?",
  "NeridaRoberts_10364": "I heard Professor Weasley transfigured the book with all her test answers into an owl to stop students from cheating.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10365": "I'm sure our beasts are safe here. But I do worry about them – especially after the troll attack.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10366": "I had heard about these odd stone tables out in the Highlands. Perhaps that's what Professor Shah was talking about.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10386": "Why did I never learn how to swim?",
  "NeridaRoberts_10387": "I'd sink like a stone –",
  "NeridaRoberts_10388": "I really should look into Gillyweed. Although, I'd still need to swim. ",
  "NeridaRoberts_10409": "Seems I'm out of the tournament, thanks to you.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10410": "Ugh, why do we have to take Astronomy? It's not even magic.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10411": "Goodness, no. Though I'm beginning to think I really should learn how to swim.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10412": "Can't very well be 'Liaison to the Merpeople' if I don't know how to swim.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10413": "Well, not technically – no. At least not yet. The position doesn't actually exist at the moment, but I have a plan to change that.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10414": "I'm Nerida by the way. Nerida Roberts.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10417": "You do? Oh, thank you. Of course, I haven't exactly done anything just yet.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10418": "They seem to be open to it so far.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10422": "Well, we've consistently deigned merpeople as being beneath us despite the many similarities between our cultures.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10423": "Oh, so many things. I want to know everything I can about them. After I've mastered swimming, I'd perfect my Mermish, of course.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10424": "The merpeople, yes.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10425": "I can't begin to tell you how brilliant they are. I mean, rumour is that tales about them have infiltrated even the Muggle world.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10426": "You'd really do that? Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10427": "I can't wait to hear about what you find. One day soon I'll see for myself, I just know it.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10428": "Merlin's beard. It's marvellous.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10430": "I'm going to show it to everyone, including the Ministry. Should I hand deliver or send by owl?",
  "NeridaRoberts_10431": "Now, if I'm not mistaken, I think you can dive down to their cave from just there in the water.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10432": "One can hardly blame them for declining 'being' status by the Ministry years ago. Who are we to classify those of such beauty and intelligence?",
  "NeridaRoberts_10433": "Oh, that's wonderful news! I was so worried I'd left it too long and they'd seen it as a slight.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10435": "Thank you, again, so much. You may have just helped improve relations between wizardkind and merpeople for decades to come.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10436": "And I'd share with them anything they wanted to know about wizardkind. My hope is that by understanding each other better, both of our societies could grow.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10437": "The oldest known merpeople, Sirens, come from Greece. And, of course, Scotland has Selkies and Ireland is home to Merrows.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10438": "I could go on for ages about them – their glorious underwater communities, domestication of sea life, their art and music – it's a travesty how little is understood about them.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10441": "What? Why would you do that? That gift was a gesture of goodwill. A symbol of hope. I was going to show it to the Ministry!",
  "NeridaRoberts_10442": "I would – if I knew how to swim.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10443": "I just hope you haven't set relations between wizardkind and merpeople back decades.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10444": "Oh. Good. You scared me for a moment.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10453": "We didn't officially meet, but we duelled in the Crossed Wands club.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10456": "And you.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10457": "I presented them with a gift a few weeks ago and they wanted to leave me one as well, in one of their caves. Reciprocity and an offer to visit.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10458": "The last thing I want is for them to think I'd shunned their gift. Diplomacy is a delicate dance.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10459": "Our relationship with them is already so tenuous.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10461": "Likely already named them too.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10462": "I am. And they're as misunderstood and disregarded by wizardkind as goblins and centaurs are.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10463": "I tried telling them I couldn't swim, but I'm afraid that bit got lost in translation. Mermish really is tricky.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10464": "I feel that if goblins and centaurs have liaison offices at the Ministry, then the merpeople should have one too.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10465": "May I – see it?",
  "NeridaRoberts_10466": "I'm hoping you'll be able to dive down and retrieve the gift they left me.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10467": "I can't wait to study this.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10468": "That's it. I shall definitely need to learn how to swim. Or use a Bubble-Head Charm.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10469": "Thank you again for retrieving that Mermish artefact for me! Fascinating. Truly fascinating.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10470": "I hope you're enjoying your 'gift' from the Merpeople. Not that you'd appreciate it.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10471": "I really don't think you're allowed to do that.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10472": "I'd much rather be underwater than in the sky.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10473": "Good for them. Most people would be too scared of a Graphorn.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10474": "It's too bad Kelpies aren't as popular as Hippogriffs.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10475": "I don't know if you know this but  you're still in your pyjamas.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10476": "Such a pity. I never even got to speak to Professor Fig.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10477": "I wonder what the Ministry has to say about the troll attack on Hogsmeade.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10478": "Ranrok's loyalists did more damage than they could possibly know.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10479": "Crossed Wands was so much fun, wasn't it?",
  "NeridaRoberts_10480": "I don't think that's a spell you're supposed to know.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10481": "Ooh – what's in there?",
  "NeridaRoberts_10483": "Don't laugh, but I've never been any good at that one.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10484": "Did I tell you I've been in touch with the Ministry about the artefact? Still haven't heard back.",
  "NeridaRoberts_10485": "Oh! Beg your pardon.",
  "NiamhFitzgerald_10000": "You found me. But you cannot undo what's been done. The magic of the stone can only conjure a shadow of my former self.",
  "NiamhFitzgerald_10002": "I am here. In this place, you may call me Niamh.",
  "NiamhFitzgerald_10003": "You shall be witness to a fable. Pay attention. Things are not always as they seem.",
  "NiamhFitzgerald_10006": "You have outrun Death thus far, but have yet to find me. Keep searching, but this time you will be unable to hide.",
  "NiamhFitzgerald_10007": "You are far from finished. Pass through the mourners ahead. Nothing is what it seems.",
  "NiamhFitzgerald_10008": "You must move swiftly and cautiously. Use the tools you encounter to find me.",
  "NiamhFitzgerald_10009": "The first you will need is a cloak.",
  "NiamhFitzgerald_10013": "But there is no light without shadow as there is no shadow without light. Simply because you can eliminate darkness does not always mean that you should.",
  "NiamhFitzgerald_10014": "Remember that as you witness my memory.",
  "NiamhFitzgerald_10017": "In this place, as in life, Death takes many forms. Avoid each of them at all costs.",
  "NiamhFitzgerald_10019": "Wield the wand you see before you. Do not squander its extraordinary power.",

I presume you’re not secretly a Legilimens, but I wonder that you seemed to know my thoughts better than I did myself. \n\nThat day in the Three Broomsticks when you spotted me huddled in a corner, staring blankly at an untouched Butterbeer and an empty bit of parchment, my quill dripping ink woefully onto the floor, and you came to sit with me – well, I shall never forget it. \n\nI recall a sudden sense of relief – as if someone had cast a Levitation Charm on me – when you told me about how nervous you'd been to come to Hogwarts. I looked at you and it seemed beyond my imagination to think of you as anything but the confident, contented witch sitting before me. \n\nIn the days that followed, I marvelled at how you charmed – in the non-magical sense, I mean – everyone around you without apology – embracing who you were and who they were. It was as though a candle had flickered on for me. I realised that I could choose that path as well.\n\nNow that my school years are ending, the frightened first-year witch I had been seems worlds away. \n\nAnd I know it’s because you saw yourself in that despairing creature in the corner of the pub and so generously extended yourself to her. \n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMirabel\n\nP.S.

And as Eunon changed, so did the results of his work: the hedges he nurtured grew vicious and volatile. \n\nThe wedding of Eunon and Artemisia was a curious affair, for Artemisia’s Muggle father and Eunon’s Muggle family were all invited. It is believed that Eunon’s family would have avoided the affair altogether if not for rumours of Artemisia’s considerable dowry which, unbeknownst to them, was not a pile of gold but a single, golden medallion",

  "OgleThePortrait_10012": "Watch the tile – under your feet, you'll set off a, ugh, something foul. Oh, please be careful.",
  "OgleThePortrait_10013": "The Headmaster shows no compassion. I deserve a location that warrants pride, not one that wreaks of manure.",

  "OminisGaunt_10545": "Seems Slytherin liked to play games.",
  "OminisGaunt_10548": "That sounded promising.",

  "OminisGaunt_10612": "I haven't spoken it in ages, but I'd wager if I speak it now, the door will open.",
  "OminisGaunt_10618": "I know. She was my aunt.",

  "OminisGaunt_10653": "Ha! You're definitely in the right house.",
  "OminisGaunt_10656": "I'm sure. How horrible. I can only imagine.",
  "OminisGaunt_10657": "Well, it's good to have you in Slytherin. Do let me know if I can be of any help as you navigate your first days here.",
  "OminisGaunt_10658": " Yes. But I've never heard of a mermaid showing up outside our common room window.",
  "OminisGaunt_10659": "Pleasure was all mine. Don't be a stranger.",
  "OminisGaunt_10660": "Not something I'm especially proud of, mind you. He was obsessed with blood status. A pure-blood maniac.",
  "OminisGaunt_10661": "Anything to do with the Dark Arts should be avoided. It's too risky.",
  "OminisGaunt_10662": "I can't agree, and I'll not say a word more. I'm sorry.",
  "OminisGaunt_10677": "Of course not! I only know about it because of my favourite aunt – Noctua. She thought like I do. Didn't agree with the family on the use of Dark Magic.",
  "OminisGaunt_10683": "This – is where she died. This is where we'll die. I shouldn't have listened to either of you.",
  "OminisGaunt_10684": "Do let me know if I can be of any help as you navigate your first days here. Though I doubt you'll need it.",
  "OminisGaunt_10685": "It is fun to play along, though. Been known to keep some first-years on the lookout for hours.",
  "OminisGaunt_10686": "Unfortunately, most of his descendants do not fall far from that tree.",
  "OminisGaunt_10690": "Someone was actually listening.",
  "OminisGaunt_10699": "Yes! It is! I thought you knew me better!",
  "OminisGaunt_10728": "It's ironic. When I left home, I vowed to leave the Dark Arts behind. And, yet, here I am. Stand back.",
  "OminisGaunt_10729": "I'm a Parselmouth – I can hear and speak to snakes. Nearly all known Parselmouths are descended from Salazar Slytherin.",
  "OminisGaunt_10737": "Don't lie to me. No one 'stumbles' upon that room. Sebastian told you, didn't he?",
  "OminisGaunt_10740": "Hmm. I see what you've done here. And, I confess, you've convinced me. I didn't think it possible.",
  "OminisGaunt_10760": "I hope I – we don't regret this.",
  "OminisGaunt_10761": "It's two heads are better than one.",
  "OminisGaunt_10762": "I hope we're ready for this.",
  "OminisGaunt_10765": "You might not want the ability to speak Parseltongue. It's often associated with Dark wizards.",
  "OminisGaunt_10774": "Aunt Noctua went down this path with good intentions and lost her life. I don't want the same to happen again.",
  "OminisGaunt_10779": "My Wiggenweld Potion's utter rubbish. Wish I could just replace it with one from J. Pippin's.",
  "OminisGaunt_10783": "Poor Aunt Noctua.",
  "OminisGaunt_10788": "Look in a mirror, Sebastian.",
  "OminisGaunt_10791": "Then Salazar Slytherin is not yet finished with us.",
  "OminisGaunt_10793": "I overheard you and Sebastian, and I won't do it. The Cruciatus Curse is pure torture. I would know.",
  "OminisGaunt_10796": "Should have known he would have told you. (sigh) And one always has a choice.",
  "OminisGaunt_10797": "The spell won't work unless you mean it. That's true of all Unforgivables. If it must be done, then one of you must cast it.",
  "OminisGaunt_10799": "I'll decide what's for my own good.",
  "OminisGaunt_10801": "You're a liar, Sebastian. I heard everything. You swore you'd never engage in anything to do with Dark Magic again.",
  "OminisGaunt_10802": "You don't know when to stop, do you?",
  "OminisGaunt_10805": "I am not letting this go.",
  "OminisGaunt_10808": "I know what I heard. You knew I wouldn't agree with this. Going after that relic is not a good idea.",
  "OminisGaunt_10811": "We were lucky – we could have died – we must swear never to do this again.",
  "OminisGaunt_10812": "Please, Sebastian.",
  "OminisGaunt_10814": "I meant what I said before. We swear right now never to engage in anything to do with Dark Magic again.",
  "OminisGaunt_10824": "It would mean a lot.",
  "OminisGaunt_10826": "It is. That's why I can't understand Sebastian's recklessness. I've practically lost Anne. I cannot lose Sebastian too.",
  "OminisGaunt_10829": "When you witness suffering like that at your own hands – you never forget it.",
  "OminisGaunt_10830": "I was taught the Cruciatus Curse as a child. My family's tradition involved torturing Muggles.",
  "OminisGaunt_10831": "Unforgivable Curses won't work unless you really mean them. I had to want to cause pain. And for that, I shall never forgive myself.",
  "OminisGaunt_10832": "When I refused, I tasted the agony of the curse myself. Eventually, I did what my family asked.",
  "OminisGaunt_10833": "Salazar Slytherin did. He's to blame for many unimaginable things.",
  "OminisGaunt_10842": "That spell's the reason I have no family left. You and Sebastian will need to sort out another solution.",
  "OminisGaunt_10844": "I've been getting an uneasy feeling about this place. We shouldn't linger here. Let's find a way out, please.",
  "OminisGaunt_10846": "Sebastian doesn't even realise it, but he's as irresponsible and reckless now as his parents were years ago. It's why they died.",
  "OminisGaunt_10849": "Mr and Mrs Sallow were professors. Spent nearly every waking moment in the cellar library – noses buried in books.",
  "OminisGaunt_10853": "Anne and Sebastian were upstairs when it happened. They heard a sudden crash and ran downstairs – but it was too late.",
  "OminisGaunt_10855": "Their parents had crumpled to the floor. A defect with the lamp in the cellar caused the room to fill with an undetectable toxin.",
  "OminisGaunt_10861": "I'm glad you understand.",
  "OminisGaunt_10863": "No, you're not. If you won't put it back, then I will.",
  "OminisGaunt_10865": "We need to stand together – convince Sebastian this is wrong.",
  "OminisGaunt_10867": "Everything. I heard you encourage Sebastian to take the relic.",
  "OminisGaunt_10868": "Something has to. I need your help.",
  "OminisGaunt_10869": "Good. We're agreed. We don't allow him to leave here with the relic.",
  "OminisGaunt_10870": "I'm sorry, my mind is made up.",
  "OminisGaunt_10871": "What are you suggesting?",
  "OminisGaunt_10872": "I feel that's what we agreed to in the scriptorium. I'm being taken for a fool.",
  "OminisGaunt_10878": "I might be. How could I choose to stand by and watch him do this?",
  "OminisGaunt_10881": "Do what you have to do. Cast it. Before I change my mind.",
  "OminisGaunt_10895": "<i>Revelio</i> may help.",
  "OminisGaunt_10896": "Perhaps all three braziers need to be lit at the same time.",
  "OminisGaunt_10898": "Is time a factor? Try lighting all three braziers with <i>Confringo</i> before any have gone out.",
  "OminisGaunt_10900": "Then look closely at each gate for clues.",
  "OminisGaunt_10903": "I can't believe we're here.",
  "OminisGaunt_10904": "You two go ahead – let me know what's in it. I'll wander around a bit.",
  "OminisGaunt_10905": "Everything to do with Salazar Slytherin seems promising, until it's too late.",
  "OminisGaunt_10908": "Wait, Anne. Please.",
  "OminisGaunt_10911": "I'm glad you're here.",
  "OminisGaunt_10912": "The place is crawling with Inferi.",
  "OminisGaunt_10921": "Stop. You did what you had to do, and I agreed. It might well have salvaged my friendship with Sebastian for the moment.",
  "OminisGaunt_10922": "Stop. You swore you wouldn't let Sebastian take this one step further, yet here we are.",
  "OminisGaunt_10923": "For the moment. I thought we'd gone too far before, but Sebastian is in real trouble now.",
  "OminisGaunt_10924": "Sebastian must not be in his right mind.",
  "OminisGaunt_10925": "Inside the catacomb. Frankly, I was surprised you weren't with him.",
  "OminisGaunt_10926": "Anne's worried. She said Sebastian promised her that I would be there if she went to meet him in the catacomb. But now he's asking her to join him immediately and to come alone. She says he doesn't sound himself. Meet us at the catacomb as soon as you can. I hope that my quill has conveyed my message clearly.",
  "OminisGaunt_10928": "Our focus now needs to be Sebastian. He's in trouble.",
  "OminisGaunt_10929": "I'm going back into the catacomb to find him. Anne's right – he and the entire hamlet are in danger.",
  "OminisGaunt_10931": "I should have stopped him before. Sebastian's in real trouble now.",
  "OminisGaunt_10932": "We're about to face worse. Let's find Sebastian, quickly.",
  "OminisGaunt_10933": "Just ahead. In the Great Room.",
  "OminisGaunt_10935": "There weren't this many Inferi before.",
  "OminisGaunt_10937": "Hold on a moment.",
  "OminisGaunt_10940": "I need to get to Hogwarts. I must get to Professor Black first. Twist the story a bit. Make him think it's a family fight.",
  "OminisGaunt_10942": "I'll be back as soon as I can. See if you can talk some sense into Sebastian.",
  "OminisGaunt_10943": "As Anne and I frantically barricaded the Inferi to keep them from escaping, Sebastian kept mumbling about healing Anne.",
  "OminisGaunt_10945": "When Anne said she couldn't stay here, I didn't realise what she meant.",
  "OminisGaunt_10946": "When she first saw the Inferi, she thought Sebastian was being attacked. But then he showed her the relic and said he'd learned how to use it.",
  "OminisGaunt_10948": "Not exactly. He's controlling them. This is powerful Dark Magic. Creating Inferi is incredibly difficult, but controlling them –  ",
  "OminisGaunt_10951": "Be careful.",
  "OminisGaunt_10952": "Fine. If I trust him on this, I'm trusting you, too. The Dark Arts seem harmless until it's too late.",
  "OminisGaunt_10954": "Remember: this is what I was telling you about the Dark Arts. They come with a cost. You may well regret making this choice.",
  "OminisGaunt_10955": "Go, then. Leave with the relic. I'll not say a word more.",
  "OminisGaunt_10965": "I don't want to lose Sebastian, but I don't think we have a choice.",
  "OminisGaunt_10975": "She's devastated. She just buried your uncle. Alone.",
  "OminisGaunt_10979": "What a mess. I can't believe it. After I last saw you, I went straight to Hogwarts.",
  "OminisGaunt_10982": "She was beside herself with grief. Part of her wants Sebastian to face the consequences – another part can't bear the thought of it.",
  "OminisGaunt_10988": "Before I had time to talk to Black, I heard from Anne. I rushed to Feldcroft and found her with Solomon's body.",
  "OminisGaunt_10989": "You breathe a word about this place to anyone and not even your precious Professor Fig will be able to help you.",
  "OminisGaunt_10990": "You breathe a word about this place to anyone and not even your precious Professor Fig will be able to help you.",
  "OminisGaunt_10991": "Why should I trust you? You just betrayed Sebastian.",
  "OminisGaunt_10992": "I don't need you to tell me about my oldest friend, thank you very much.",
  "OminisGaunt_10993": "I know what you meant. Sebastian gets himself in enough trouble. He doesn't need your help.",
  "OminisGaunt_10994": "My father is friends with the Headmaster and I'm not afraid to exploit that connection if I need to.",
  "OminisGaunt_10995": "My father is friends with the Headmaster. I'm not afraid to exploit that connection if I need to.",
  "OminisGaunt_10996": "Hello Sebastian. Wait.",
  "OminisGaunt_10997": "I was so worried about Sebastian, I didn't even realise – Anne's gone to get Solomon!",
  "OminisGaunt_10998": "I wish I hadn't been. If we do this, we may never see Sebastian again.",
  "OminisGaunt_11000": "Very well. Leave it to me. I'll tell the Headmaster.",
  "OminisGaunt_11002": "Have you broken something?",
  "OminisGaunt_11003": "Taking out your frustrations, are you?",
  "OminisGaunt_11004": "Not sure you need to be quite so destructive.",
  "OminisGaunt_11019": "It's a wonder Professor Fig has time to teach a class at all. He never seems to be in the castle.",
  "OminisGaunt_11020": "Can't imagine how the other professors must be feeling after losing Professor Fig.",
  "OminisGaunt_11021": "I think I shall delay my next trip to Hogsmeade, what with mad trolls on the loose and all.",
  "OminisGaunt_11023": "Seems Ranrok's threat was even greater than the most pessimistic of us expected.",
  "OminisGaunt_11025": "Lucan Brattleby must have nearly wet himself when you won every single Crossed Wands battle.",
  "OminisGaunt_11026": "Honestly can't believe you won all three trials against Imelda. I didn't think she could be beat.",
  "OminisGaunt_11027": "I heard you were quite the spectacle at Summoner's Court. You have some prowess.",
  "OminisGaunt_11028": "Where did you and Natty disappear to? Cressida's been trying to track her down.",
  "OminisGaunt_11029": "Pleased Poppy found a friend in you – she won't let you down.",
  "OminisGaunt_11030": "Certainly spending a lot of time with Sebastian, aren't you? Just don't get carried away.",
  "OminisGaunt_11031": "Careful – if you spend too much time with Amit, you'll start to like studying.",
  "OminisGaunt_11032": "Imelda's quick, and not just on a broom. Glad you two have become friends.",
  "OminisGaunt_11033": "You and Everett seem as thick as thieves.",
  "OminisGaunt_11034": "Heard you're defending Hogsmeade against trolls – you know, there is such a thing as trying too hard.",
  "OminisGaunt_11035": "Can't believe Ferdinand's portrait's back in the Three Broomsticks! Thought we were rid of him for good.",
  "OminisGaunt_11036": "Ferdinand's portrait ended up in the Hog's Head? Ugh, they'll likely adore the little toadstool over there.",
  "OminisGaunt_11037": "That insufferable mouthpiece – about time Ferdinand's portrait is gone from the Three Broomsticks.",
  "OminisGaunt_11038": "Do you know what you're doing?",
  "OminisGaunt_11039": "None of that is tolerated around here.",
  "OminisGaunt_11040": "The Dark Arts is not something to trifle with.",
  "OminisGaunt_11041": "That is cause for concern.",
  "OminisGaunt_11042": "Breaking in, are we?",
  "OminisGaunt_11043": "What is it that you're up to?",
  "OminisGaunt_11044": "You're quite the covert little thief, aren't you? Well done.",
  "OminisGaunt_11048": "We are all in your debt for stopping Ranrok and his Loyalists. Thank you.",
  "OminisGaunt_11049": "Don't get too cocky simply because you had one victory over Sallow. He never backs down from a fight.",
  "OminisGaunt_11050": "Be careful, won't you?",
  "OminisGaunt_11051": "What are you playing at?",
  "OminisGaunt_11052": "No one around here is going to stand for that.",
  "OminisGaunt_11053": "What in the – ? What are you trying to do?",
  "OminisGaunt_11054": "I'm pleased the bells are ringing again.",
  "OminisGaunt_11055": "I can't believe we found ourselves trapped in that Scriptorium. Never again.",
  "OminisGaunt_11056": "Heard you and Sebastian traversed a mountain in Loyalist territory. You know, that sort of thing could have got you both killed.",
  "OminisGaunt_11065": "Careful.",
  "OminisGaunt_11066": "You again?",
  "OminisGaunt_11067": "Watch where you're going there.",
  "OminisGaunt_11071": "She'd heard of this 'scriptorium' and thought its contents might shed some light on him. She even found the secret entrance – in this very corridor.",
  "OminisGaunt_11072": "She wrote regularly to my father about her efforts to gain access, and then she simply vanished. No one else ever tried to enter.",
  "OminisGaunt_11073": "I'm hoping you're having second thoughts.",
  "OminisGaunt_11074": "Aunt Noctua said the same. It may take practice to solve it.",
  "OminisGaunt_11076": "Search each corridor – it may not be obvious which leads where.",
  "OminisGaunt_11077": "Sebastian – not now. We need to get to that scriptorium.",
  "OminisGaunt_11078": "That's why I said this could be dangerous. Aunt Noctua kept my father informed until she vanished.",
  "OminisGaunt_11079": "Impressive. Nice work.",
  "OminisGaunt_11080": "This whole place is troubling, but, for my aunt's sake, we cannot stop now.",
  "OminisGaunt_11081": "I'm as guilty as the worst of my family.",
  "OminisGaunt_11082": "There's bound to be a match to the symbols.",
  "OminisGaunt_11084": "I will.",
  "OminisGaunt_11085": "I suppose after all this, I am grateful to know what happened to her. Thank you.",
  "OminisGaunt_11087": "Sebastian and Anne were helpless. They had no magic yet.",
  "OminisGaunt_11088": "Please. Avoid anything to do with that spellbook.",
  "OminisGaunt_11089": "I was hoping we'd get a moment to speak.",
  "OminisGaunt_11090": "I appreciate you telling Sebastian not to keep this from me, but going after that relic is not a good idea.",
  "OminisGaunt_11091": "Go and see Sebastian. Before I change my mind.",
  "OminisGaunt_11099": "Farewell, for now. I shall be in touch.",
  "OminisGaunt_11100": "I'll give you some time to think, Sebastian.",
  "OminisGaunt_11102": "What is it? What have you and Sebastian been up to now?",
  "OminisGaunt_11103": "(sigh) I suppose that makes sense. It's just – Sebastian's been pestering me lately about something and I'm frustrated with him.",
  "OminisGaunt_11104": "He told you about that?",
  "OminisGaunt_11105": "Yes, well, he seems to think it contains the answer to saving Anne. I think it's likely full of Dark Magic that is better left untouched.",
  "OminisGaunt_11106": "In fact, she'd hoped to convince my family that there was more to Salazar Slytherin than worshipping pure-blood status.",
  "OminisGaunt_11107": "Very well, I shall tell you what I know. Fetch Sebastian. I'll wait.",
  "OminisGaunt_11108": "Between the two of us?",
  "OminisGaunt_11110": "I hope Sebastian pursues this no further. But, if you think he might, please, let me know.",
  "OminisGaunt_11112": "That's why I can't understand Sebastian's recklessness. I've practically lost Anne. I can't lose Sebastian too.",
  "OminisGaunt_11113": "What in the world are you suggesting? <i>Imperio</i>?",
  "OminisGaunt_11114": "This is insanity. I can't believe you would ask this of me.",
  "OminisGaunt_11115": "This is insanity. I can't believe you would ask this of me.",
  "OminisGaunt_11116": "I'm – I – Fine. This is unfathomable. But I suppose if you want that responsibility, it may just save what is left of – of my friendship with Sebastian.",
  "OminisGaunt_11117": "I'm – I – Fine. This is unfathomable. But I suppose if you want that responsibility, it may just save what is left of – of my friendship with Sebastian.",
  "OminisGaunt_11118": "I recognise that voice. You're the new fifth-year.",
  "OminisGaunt_11119": "I recognise that voice. Heard you talking to Garreth Weasley in Potions class. You're the new fifth-year.",
  "OminisGaunt_11120": "Remember: this is what I was telling you about the Dark Arts. They come with a cost. You may well regret making this choice.",
  "OminisGaunt_11121": "You'll see. We need to hurry.",
  "OminisGaunt_11122": "Sebastian – Anne can't bear the thought of turning you in, but –",
  "OminisGaunt_11123": "We've both heard that before.",
  "OminisGaunt_11124": "I – I understand what you're saying. Perhaps you're right. As much as I believe that Sebastian should pay for his actions –",
  "OminisGaunt_11125": "– we'd only be punishing Anne as well. I hope we're doing the right thing.",
  "OminisGaunt_11126": "I'll talk to Anne. If it comes from me, she'll agree with this decision.",
  "OminisGaunt_11127": "Never imagined we'd attend a funeral for one of our professors.",
  "OminisGaunt_11128": "I heard a rumour that he confronted you outside of Ollivanders. Sounds as if you faced quite a fight.",
  "OminisGaunt_11129": "Wait – what are you saying?",
  "OminisGaunt_11130": "This – this can't be. The night Anne was cursed, all she saw were goblins.",
  "OminisGaunt_11131": "I can't believe it was Rookwood all along.",
  "OminisGaunt_11132": "Thank you for coming.",
  "OminisGaunt_11133": "(sigh) It will never be the same without him. Just standing here in the Undercroft without Sebastian feels wrong.",
  "OminisGaunt_11136": "I'm glad you came to Hogwarts.",
  "OminisGaunt_11137": "Glad Weasley spoke for Fig – she honoured him. He'll be well remembered.",
  "OminisGaunt_11138": "I only wish we could have done the same for Solomon Sallow. I need to go and check on Anne soon.",
  "OminisGaunt_11139": "As we discussed, I spoke with Black. Sebastian's with the Headmaster now – but perhaps there's a way to get word to him. When I find out, I'll send an owl.",
  "OminisGaunt_11140": "I have news about Sebastian. Meet me in the Undercroft as soon as you can.",
  "OminisGaunt_11141": "So he cursed her. So cruel. Rookwood got what he deserved.",
  "OminisGaunt_11142": "Thank you for telling me. Anne – and Sebastian – deserve to know, and it should come from me.",
  "OminisGaunt_11143": "I was. Black let me talk to Sebastian before he left.",
  "OminisGaunt_11144": "At first, he wouldn't believe it. Then he realised it all made sense. Unfortunately, his anger only grew – towards goblins and Dark wizards.",
  "OminisGaunt_11145": "Anne was shocked too – but in some sense relieved to know the truth about who was responsible. I think it brought her some peace.",
  "OminisGaunt_11146": "Although Anne wanted to turn him in, I think now she's torn. I confess I know how she feels. As much as we all wanted Sebastian to face the consequences of his actions – ",
  "OminisGaunt_11147": "He's been expelled – and will soon face trial at the Ministry.",
  "OminisGaunt_11148": "She does. Sebastian was my best friend. I can't imagine Hogwarts – or anywhere – without him.",
  "OminisGaunt_11149": "I know you two had grown close. That you were helping each other with more than just finding a cure for Anne. He never gave specifics, but I know it was important.",
  "OminisGaunt_11150": "I hope so too.",
  "OminisGaunt_11151": "We did. I just wish things had turned out differently.",
  "OminisGaunt_11152": "He meant – means – a lot to us both. I hope we get the chance to tell him that one day.",
  "OminisGaunt_11153": "I know we had a bit of a rocky start, but you've proven yourself – as a friend.",
  "OminisGaunt_11154": "Well, you'd be using it on clothing to be precise, Sebastian. You know it won't work on humans.",
  "OttoDibble_10026": "I hid the note behind the counter and offered to help him. He stared at me for a moment, then asked me to check on an order he'd placed.",
  "OttoDibble_10027": "It all happened so quickly. In an instant, he took a very expensive scarf from the counter, pocketed it, and smiled.",
  "OttoDibble_10028": "I've been able to cover for his requests until now with some creative bookkeeping.",
  "OttoDibble_10029": "But I can't keep it up for much longer. I'm terrified to say anything. I could never live without Rosie.",
  "OttoDibble_10030": "It's on Rosie's special pink stationery. It has her monogram at the top: R.H. That's how Mr Hill would know it was real.",
  "OttoDibble_10032": "Well, as I mentioned, creative bookkeeping. And, I've also been trying to cover the costs with my own savings, but I'm running out of money.",
  "OttoDibble_10045": "We haven't told Mr Hill yet. I daresay he has higher hopes for her.",
  "OttoDibble_10047": "It was a note from Rosie Hill. Mr Hill's daughter. You see, we've been, well, secretly engaged these past six months.",
  "OttoDibble_10054": "Of course, none of this bodes well for my efforts to improve my circumstances and be worthy of Rosie.",
  "OttoDibble_10064": "He's a lovely man. But, when it comes to Rosie, I fear he loses all perspective. He'd see this as a grave betrayal.",
  "OttoDibble_10068": "It started a few weeks ago. I was distracted – reading a note – when you know who came into the shop.",
  "OttoDibble_10069": "I went into the storeroom to check on what turned out to be a non-existent order. When I returned, he was holding the note.",
  "OttoDibble_10070": "Harlow advised me in no uncertain terms that my relationship with Rosie – not to mention my employment here – depended upon my cooperation.",
  "OttoDibble_10071": "He said, 'your secret is safe as long as I can supply my lady friend with delightful items like this every so often.'",
  "OttoDibble_10073": "Please tell me he didn't take it. Perhaps it's been here all along.",
  "OttoDibble_10074": "Now, hurry off before Mr Hill returns. Where was I?",
  "OttoDibble_10077": "As for Rosie's letter – should you happen upon it – I have committed it to memory. You may destroy it immediately.",
  "OttoDibble_10080": "The Ashwinders have ceased pestering me. I suspect that's your doing. Thank you from me and Rosie both. We're just leaving for our honeymoon – after we tell Mr Hill of our recent marriage. Wish me luck!",
  "OttoDibble_10082": "I do mind. I can't have Mr Hill overhearing. Ask your questions – quickly!",
  "OttoDibble_10083": "I've nothing to say about him. Er, may I interest you in a stunning cravat today?",
  "OttoDibble_10084": "You know the Bickles? All right. But we must be discreet. Can't have Mr Hill hearing this.",
  "OttoDibble_10086": "I would love nothing more than to see him rotting in Azkaban. But be careful. He's an awful man, and incredibly dangerous.",
  "OttoDibble_10087": "I'd lose my job instantly – and Rosie as well.",
  "OttoDibble_10088": "He's a good man. But even he wouldn't  understand about Harlow.",
  "OwenWynn_10018": "Up!",
  "OWL_AVM_02_01_HorntailHall": "Natty told me about your run-in with the poachers. I have some news about them as well. Can you meet me soon? I fear that some of what I uncovered has to do with you.\n\nPoppy",

  "PadraicHaggarty_10090": "It was too much to hope for anyway. Hmph. I appreciate what you did uncover.",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10091": "Thank you. You don't know how much this means to me.",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10092": "Catrin's a disappointment for certain. But I never wanted to believe she was behind this. Now, thanks to you, I won't have to.",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10093": "Mother's rolling in her grave, she is.",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10094": "If one more person asks me about her – ",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10095": "Must've snuck in after I fell asleep.",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10096": "Besides, the thief – my sister – only strikes at night – coward. Long past your bedtime.",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10097": "Ah, hello. The name is Pádraic Haggarty and this is my shop. What may I help you with?",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10098": "All of my life. My sister and I were raised here. I stuck around – she had other plans.",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10099": "I sell all manner of beast products. I always found beasts interesting, and there's quite a market for them.",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10100": "I've been near it, but never in it. I could likely find some valuable beast products, but it's not worth the risk.",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10102": "Fancied I could make a profession out of it.",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10103": "Ranrok's Loyalists are not ones to be messed with.",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10105": "Certainly, that'd be fine. What would you like to know?",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10106": "Hmph. I suppose that's only fair. Very well, we'll call it a reward. Sounds more decent that way.",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10107": "I've got my heirloom back – and I'm able to look my neighbours in the eye now –",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10108": "– thanks to you proving it was a Niffler and not my sister who stole from us.",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10109": "I'll be able to look my neighbours in the eye now, thanks to you proving my sister wasn't the one who stole from us.",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10110": "Pity you weren't able to find my family heirloom.",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10111": "Glad I'll be able to look my neighbours in the eye now. Pity about that heirloom, though.",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10112": "What a strange world we live in. S'pose they can't send a Niffler to Azkaban. At least I got my heirloom back.",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10113": "You as well. What can I help you with?",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10114": "Those certainly don't look like any school robes I've ever seen.",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10115": "You the one that helped Agnes with her Niffler? Glad she got it back. Hate having those beasts roaming around stealing things.",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10116": "My sister was always up to that type of magic. No good will come of it, mark my words.",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10118": "I'd rather you didn't practise your spells here.",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10119": "What brings you to Irondale today?",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10120": "Thank you for your patronage.",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10121": "It's good luck for me you stopped by today.",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10122": "Afraid you'll need deeper pockets for that.",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10123": "Glad you were able to stop by.",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10124": "What can I help you with today?",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10125": "Keep an eye out.",
  "PadraicHaggarty_10126": "Careful, there.",
  "PatrickRedding_10098": "Testing the limits of society, are we? One would think clothes hadn't been invented.",
  "PatrickRedding_10099": "I daresay that Harlow fellow got what he deserved.",
  "PatrickRedding_10100": "Never knew butterflies were attracted to treasure. Must've missed that one in Beasts.",
  "PatrickRedding_10101": "The Dark Arts? I shall have no such vileness on these premises.",
  "PatrickRedding_10103": "Not in here! Not in here!",
  "PatrickRedding_10104": "Welcome. Plenty of goodies here so take your time. Here if you need me.",
  "PatrickRedding_10105": "Oh, been stung by a Billywig, have we?",
  "PatrickRedding_10106": "Careful. Don't destroy things you can't repair.",

  "Peeves_10058": "Peevesy has a brand-new game – just beware the open flame!",
  "Peeves_10059": "Why do students always frown? Peeves should burn the castle down!",
  "Peeves_10060": "Potions is dull and Charms is dire. Nothing's as clever as playing with fire!",
  "Peeves_10061": "Peevesy has a special knack – it's tormenting Professor Black.",
  "Peeves_10067": "What's wrong, ickle student? Afraid of a staircase?",
  "Peeves_10068": "Ooh, how fun! A slide! You must try it.",
  "Peeves_10069": "Students think they're oh-so-clever, Peevesy's game's the best one ever!",
  "Peeves_10070": "You cannot win, but don't be shy. For I can't wait to watch you try!",
  "Peeves_10071": "Care to race?",

  "Peeves_10078": "Ooo, so sensitive!",
  "Peeves_10079": "Now, now, no need to get your wand in a twist!",
  "Peeves_10080": "Did Peevesy give diddums a startle?",

  "Peeves_10113": "Goblins, werewolves, where were you, in the goblin rebellion of sev’teen fifty-two?",
  "Peeves_10114": "Oh, what fun, I won’t say my goodbyes; I shall cheer for the boy who says you’re telling lies!",
  "Peeves_10115": "Ooooh! Fight, fight! It’s a bold attack. Was the Minister a Boot, or the Minister a Flack?",
  "Peeves_10116": "In trouble you will be, but you can’t give Peeves a smack! She says it’s a Boot, and he says it’s a Flack!",
  "Peeves_10117": "It wasn’t Boot and it wasn’t Flack. But you’re all in trouble with Professor Black!",
  "Peeves_10118": "Weeeeeee!",
  "Peeves_10119": "Here I've come from the toilet bowl, where she said I could swim did Eupraxia Mole.",
  "Peeves_10120": "As long as 'twere only one time per week, I can plunge the boys' lavatory – not for the meek!",
  "Peeves_10121": "He tried to stop me did Rancorous Carpe. Sought to trap me, confine me, inside of a jar –",

  "Peeves_10123": "It was granted my privileges be handsome indeed, or I'd fire up the cannon and so she agreed –",

  "Penny_10000": "Oh! Penny is so pleased. Penny was hoping you would be the one to purchase it.",
  "Penny_10003": "Goodness. What a kind thing to say. Penny will do all that she can to make this a success.",
  "Penny_10004": "There is much to do. The last tenant left in a bit of a rush, so we'll need to clean up and do some repairs.",
  "Penny_10005": "Penny is ready!",
  "Penny_10006": "Hello! Pardon me.",
  "Penny_10007": "Hello again! Penny imagines you have lots of things to sell – and Penny is never happier than when she is helping to run a shop.",
  "Penny_10008": "Oh, Penny is so glad you're back!",
  "Penny_10010": "Oh, Penny is certain that's a brilliant idea. Officer Singer will know what to do.",
  "Penny_10012": "(deep exhale) Oh! Please forgive Penny. Penny is forbidden from telling you anything.",
  "Penny_10014": "Nothing like a bit of hard work!",
  "Penny_10015": "This will surely be the most successful shop in Hogsmeade.",
  "Penny_10016": "Can't wait to see how wonderful it's going to look when we're all finished.",
  "Penny_10017": "Between the two of us, we should have this place up and running in no time.",
  "Penny_10018": "Ooh! Penny can already see the potential!",
  "Penny_10019": "Goodness, this is a lot of work! But well worth it!",
  "Penny_10021": "Probably just a Doxy or two. Not to worry. Penny will deal with them later.",
  "Penny_10024": "Such a racket! Penny is certain it will die down.",
  "Penny_10027": "Perhaps the noise is a lost Bowtruckle. Penny will have a look after we've cleaned.",
  "Penny_10028": "Penny's the name. Penny's mistress is selling this shop – and Penny is most eager to start working with the new owner!",
  "Penny_10032": "You can find Mistress Mason at her home on the north edge of the village.",
  "Penny_10033": "All kinds! Anything from Essence of Dittany to Mooncalf fur.",
  "Penny_10063": "Penny cannot imagine there is anything of value in that old chest.",
  "Penny_10068": "Oh, thank you! Thank you! Penny never thought she would be given clothing and become a free elf.",
  "Penny_10069": "Of course, Penny will be staying on and managing the shop for you.",
  "Penny_10075": "Oh! Well – that is good news!",
  "Penny_10076": "It is wonderful to see you back here!",
  "Penny_10079": "Of course! Penny's happy to help.",
  "Penny_10080": "All kinds! Anything from Essence of Dittany to Mooncalf fur.",
  "Penny_10081": "Oh, the previous tenants were not – uh – able to manage very well. They seem to have given up rather quickly.",
  "Penny_10087": "Wonderful!",
  "Penny_10089": "It is most certainly nothing that you and Penny can't handle together. Shall we?",
  "Penny_10095": "If you want the shop, and Penny hopes that you do, you should talk to Penny's mistress as soon as you can. Her name is Cassandra Mason.",
  "Penny_10098": "You'll be able to give Penny almost anything that you want to sell. It will be no work at all for you once the shop is up and running.",
  "Penny_10099": "Penny cannot be certain, as Mistress Mason so rarely confides in her.",
  "Penny_10100": "Oh, the previous tenants were not – uh – able to manage very well. They seem to have given up rather quickly.",
  "Penny_10101": "Penny is perfectly capable of helping clean and repair, so the shop will be ready for business in no time!",
  "Penny_10103": "Oh, this is splendid news, indeed. You won't be sorry!",
  "Penny_10104": "Oh, before he died, Penny's previous owner, Master Mason, trusted her to do all sorts of things to help him with his shop.",
  "Penny_10105": "Penny supposes it is a bit unusual for a house-elf to possess such skill. But Master Mason commanded it and Penny was happy to oblige.",
  "Penny_10108": "She has had rotten bad luck with the last few tenants.",
  "Penny_10109": "Penny was beginning to think yet another shopkeeper was going to end up in St Mungo's.",
  "Penny_10110": "However, she repeatedly mentions how tired she has become of trying to let the shop.",
  "Penny_10112": "It might surprise you to know that Penny can sell practically anything.",
  "Penny_10113": "Oh, but think of the Galleons you could earn!",
  "Penny_10114": "If a buyer exists for something, then Penny can sell it. And get the best price. Just ask Mistress Mason.",
  "Penny_10115": "(deep inhale)",
  "Penny_10116": "(deep exhale)",
  "Penny_10117": "Penny is fine. Sometimes Penny simply needs to remind herself to stop talking.",
  "Penny_10118": "(deep inhale)",
  "Penny_10119": "Penny does hope you talk to Mistress Mason soon!",
  "Penny_10121": "(deep inhale)",
  "Penny_10122": "(deep exhale)",
  "Penny_10124": "Penny does hope she gets to work with you.",
  "Penny_10125": "Oh, before he died, Penny's previous owner, Mr Mason, trusted her to do all sorts of things to help him with his shop.",
  "Penny_10126": "Penny supposes it is a bit unusual for a house-elf to possess such skill. But Mr Mason commanded it and Penny was happy to oblige.",
  "Penny_10127": "Mr Mason was a wonderful master.",
  "Penny_10130": "Penny is so sorry. Penny wanted to tell you everything. Truly. Surely Officer Singer will know what to do.",
  "Penny_10131": "Penny will wait right here.",
  "Penny_10132": "If a buyer exists for something, then Penny can sell it. And get the best price.  Just ask Mistress Mason.",
  "Penny_10133": "(deep inhale)",
  "Penny_10134": "(deep exhale)",
  "Penny_10135": "But Penny is perfectly capable of helping to clean and repair, so the shop will be ready for business in no time!",
  "Penny_10136": "Master Mason was a wonderful master.",
  "Penny_10138": "Penny is so relieved. Penny had the most difficult time keeping the truth from you.",
  "Penny_10139": "Penny is too.",
  "Penny_10140": "Mistress Mason wanted Penny to be sure and give you this key. It opens a chest in the back room of the shop.",
  "Penny_10141": "(deep inhale)",
  "Penny_10142": "(deep exhale)",
  "Penny_10143": "Penny must get back to work now.",
  "Penny_10144": "Penny wonders if you should open the chest.",
  "Penny_10149": "Penny is confused. Penny thought that if you came back, you would own the shop.",
  "Penny_10150": "Penny promises to work as hard as she can for such a kind, new owner.",
  "Penny_10151": "Yes? Penny is happy to do anything her new owner needs.",
  "Penny_10152": "Of course!",
  "Penny_10154": "But – all Penny has ever wanted to do is run a shop with a friend – and sell to the villagers in Hogsmeade.",
  "Penny_10155": "Hello! I was wondering if you would be interested in having your own shop – and a house-elf to help you with it.",
  "Penny_10156": "All that's left is for you to choose a sign for your new shop and Penny will take care of the rest!",
  "Penny_10157": "Excellent choice! Have a look outside.",
  "Penny_10158": "Oh dear, Penny can tell someone's very upset.",
  "Penny_10159": "Sometimes Penny doesn't understand witches and wizards.",
  "Penny_10160": "Defeating Harlow. Penny wonders what it must be like to be so brave.",
  "Penny_10161": "Oh, naughty Penny. Penny is most sorry for whatever she has done.",
  "Penny_10163": "Penny does not like such magic.",
  "Penny_10164": "Ah, Penny is so very happy to see you.",
  "Penny_10165": "Oh, Penny's day just became much brighter.",
  "Penny_10166": "Oh, Penny is surely more lucky than any house-elf to be visited by you.",
  "Penny_10167": "Oh, Penny will fetch a good price for what you'd like to sell!",
  "Penny_10168": "Penny wishes you safe and wondrous travels.",
  "Penny_10169": "Oh, perhaps today you have something you'd like Penny to sell for you?",
  "Penny_10170": "Oh! Penny was surely careless.",
  "PercivalPippin_10084": "Welcome to J. Pippin's Potions.",
  "PercivalPippin_10085": "Though – I don't believe I've seen your face here before either.",
  "PercivalPippin_10092": "You'll have read it on the sign of course, but grandfather always made me say it in full.",
  "PercivalPippin_10097": "Feel free to take a look at the rest of my inventory or come back another time if you're in a rush today.",
  "PercivalPippin_10099": "They may not be as showy as spellwork, but make no mistake, they are just as powerful. They can heal, destroy, protect – you'll discover all of this soon enough.",
  "PercivalPippin_10100": "How may I help you today?",
  "PercivalPippin_10101": "You're the student she sent the owl about.",
  "PercivalPippin_10102": "Is it really? Well, Parry Pippin at your service. And this is J. Pippin's Potions – Potions for All Ailments.",
  "PercivalPippin_10103": "I set your things aside immediately. I suspected if you're anything like I was at your age, you'd want your potion supplies.",
  "PercivalPippin_10104": "Is it not the most fascinating art, potion-making? Rivals anything you can do with a wand, I've always said.",
  "PercivalPippin_10105": "As it's your first time in, I should mention that it's not just potion recipes I sell.",
  "PercivalPippin_10106": "I also offer ready-made draughts for all manner of uses – and I unveil new ones from time to time. Pop in when you can so you don't miss out on anything.",
  "PercivalPippin_10107": "But for now, let's get you those recipes, shall we?",
  "PercivalPippin_10108": "Yes, I do. A capable student such as yourself should have no trouble making the trip to Keenbridge. It's just south of Hogwarts.",
  "PercivalPippin_10110": "Fatimah Lawang ordered a few Invisibility Potions.",
  "PercivalPippin_10111": "I used to go myself, but lately Fatimah has taken to turning every visit into an argument.",
  "PercivalPippin_10112": "You there! How would you like a job?",
  "PercivalPippin_10113": "Care to make a delivery for me?",
  "PercivalPippin_10114": "A moment of your time?",
  "PercivalPippin_10115": "Constantly complaining about the quality of my stock. How can I maintain excellence when she orders so often – giving me no time to brew?",
  "PercivalPippin_10116": "If you'd take this rather irritating task off my hands, I'd happily allow you to claim the delivery fee from Fatimah.",
  "PercivalPippin_10117": "Here are the Invisibility Potions she requested. Hopefully she won't give you too much trouble.",
  "PercivalPippin_10118": "You've no idea how grateful I am. Truly.",
  "PercivalPippin_10119": "Indeed.",
  "PercivalPippin_10120": "Fatimah Lawang in Keenbridge requested some Invisibility Potions.",
  "PercivalPippin_10121": "She turns every one of my visits into an argument, but hopefully she won't give you the same trouble.",
  "PercivalPippin_10122": "If you take them to her for me, you can keep the delivery fee.",
  "PercivalPippin_10123": "Very good. And did she cause you any trouble?",
  "PercivalPippin_10124": "Glad to hear it. And thank you again for your help.",
  "PercivalPippin_10125": "I do truly appreciate your help. And at least it's done with.",
  "PercivalPippin_10126": "Likewise! Worth every bit of that delivery fee to have someone capable deal with that witch.",
  "PercivalPippin_10127": "Oh, thank goodness. When I heard the bell I thought you were Miss Lawang – not that she deigns to come here.",
  "PercivalPippin_10128": "Good day to you. I require assistance with a delivery and thought you might be interested. Please visit me at J. Pippin's Potions if you'd like to earn a few coins.",
  "PercivalPippin_10136": "She's a talented Potioneer in her own right. I daresay, I wouldn't mind having a look at her potion recipes one day.",
  "PercivalPippin_10137": "Is this – Fatimah's recipe book?",
  "PercivalPippin_10138": "I suppose that's business for you. Very well, I shall increase your pay, but I'm not at all pleased about it.",
  "PercivalPippin_10139": "Some things are sacred amongst potioneers. I shall return it to her immediately.",
  "PercivalPippin_10140": "I appreciate what you're saying, but you have much to learn about respecting the property of others.",
  "PercivalPippin_10141": "Thank you, again, for delivering those potions to Madam Lawang. Saved me a lot of time and trouble.",
  "PercivalPippin_10143": "Do take care.",
  "PercivalPippin_10144": "Dressed to impress, I see.",
  "PercivalPippin_10145": "With Harlow gone, perhaps things will calm down a bit.",
  "PercivalPippin_10146": "Hear you found a bit of treasure in the forest. Was never one for adventure myself.",

  "PercivalPippin_10151": "Come on in. Healing potions are a speciality here should you need any.",
  "PercivalPippin_10152": "Welcome. Do let me know if I can be of any assistance at all.",
  "PercivalPippin_10153": "Hello there. In the market for potions, are we?",
  "PercivalPippin_10154": "We have everything a young student might need when it comes to potions. Have a good look around.",
  "PercivalPippin_10155": "A wise decision. Thank you.",
  "PercivalPippin_10156": "Very good. Never hurts to keep my stocks replenished.",
  "PercivalPippin_10157": "It would appear that you don't have enough for that.",
  "PercivalPippin_10158": "I hope to see you again. Farewell for now.",
  "PercivalPippin_10159": "What can I do for you today?",
  "PercivalPippin_10160": "Ah hello. I often find it easier to concentrate after the bustle of the day as well. Take your time.",
  "PercivalPippin_10161": "If you should need anything, don't hesitate to ask.",
  "PercivalPippin_10162": "Pardon me.",
  "PercivalPippin_10163": "Someone's in need of a Calming Draught.",
  "PerditaStrix_10000": "If only someone would come to my aid.",
  "PerditaStrix_10001": "Would you mind helping a poor old witch?",
  "PerditaStrix_10002": "You there! Can you help me?",
  "PerditaStrix_10003": "I would so appreciate a little help.",
  "PerditaStrix_10004": "You may well ask – I'm convinced I saw a Grim. An omen of death!",
  "PerditaStrix_10005": "You've changed your mind?",
  "PerditaStrix_10006": "Oh, you're a gem, you are. I’ll be sure to be very careful – and you be careful too.",
  "PerditaStrix_10007": "Safe. Careful. Yes, that makes sense. And you’re sure you don’t – no. Very well.",
  "PerditaStrix_10008": "I’m not safe. But – if it can’t see me, I’ll be all right, won't I?",
  "PerditaStrix_10009": "All I need is an Invisibility Potion. Yes. That's what I need.",
  "PerditaStrix_10010": "I can see you don’t believe me. Fine. Then my blood will be on your hands.",
  "PerditaStrix_10011": "No Grim is going to get me – thanks to you, kind child.",
  "PerditaStrix_10012": "I must insist that you accept this small token of my gratitude for your thoughtfulness.",
  "PerditaStrix_10013": "Hopefully the Grim – or whatever it has foretold – doesn't get me first.",

  "PhineasBlack_10964": "I would think that after all the trouble you caused me with Osric you would be eager to make amends.",

  "PhineasBlack_10991": "Allow me to finish.",
  "PhineasBlack_10992": "– the loyalty of Helga Hufflepuff –",
  "PhineasBlack_10993": "– the wisdom of Rowena Ravenclaw –",
  "PhineasBlack_10994": "– and the ambition of Salazar Slytherin.",
  "PhineasBlack_10995": "And so, the winner of this year's House Cup –",
  "PhineasBlack_10996": "Ah. Yes. Thank you, Professor Weasley.",
  "PhineasBlack_10997": "I suppose we have our winner.",
  "PhineasBlack_11006": " <i>Glacius</i>.",
  "PhineasBlack_11007": "Well?",

  "PhineasBlack_11009": "Putting my reputation at risk with your infantile antics.",
  "PhineasBlack_11010": "The wise rabbit doesn’t seek to outrun the tortoise – because it’s not necessary. On your way.",
  "PhineasBlack_11011": "And you: stay out of their way.",
  "PhineasBlack_11014": "Professor Eleazar Fig. I daresay he was a beloved professor to many of you. Certainly, a – long-standing colleague to his peers.",
  "PhineasBlack_11015": "A famed adventurer and renowned seeker of knowledge, he built a reputation –",
  "PhineasBlack_11016": "– charging into the unknown – brazenly disregarding both discretion and safety. Providing, perhaps, a rather unfortunate lesson for us all.",
  "PhineasBlack_11017": "His devotion to adventure was rivalled only by his dedication to Hogwarts – and, of course, to his wife, Mari-, MIRiam, whom we lost much too soon as well.",
  "PhineasBlack_11022": "Ahem. To Professor Fig.",
  "PhineasBlack_11030": "Fig – nice of you to join us.",
  "PhineasBlack_11031": "The Sorting Ceremony's over.",
  "PhineasBlack_11032": "Complications?",
  "PhineasBlack_11033": "(groan) Enough. Goblins. I've no time for rumours, Fig. And I'm rapidly losing whatever patience I had left.",
  "PhineasBlack_11034": "If you're lucky, we might still be able to get you sorted this evening.",
  "PhineasBlack_11035": "Professor Weasley! We've one more to be sorted.",
  "PhineasBlack_11036": "Oh, and one more thing –",
  "PhineasBlack_11037": "Due to the unfortunate injury on the pitch in last spring's final, this year's Quidditch season has been cancelled.",
  "PhineasBlack_11038": "Enough. It's not as though I've banned flying altogether. But – don't tempt me.",
  "PhineasBlack_11039": "You are here to focus on your academic futures. I'm sure you all have plenty to do before classes begin tomorrow.",
  "PhineasBlack_11040": "I said – I'm sure you all have plenty to do before classes begin tomorrow.",
  "PhineasBlack_11041": "Professor Weasley – would you be so kind as to show our new student to their common room?",
  "PhineasBlack_11043": "Today's youth are devoid of dignity. I despair for the future.",
  "PhineasBlack_11047": "Terribly unfortunate about Fig. Truly. But now we must move on; learn from his mistakes.",
  "PhineasBlack_11048": "Frankly, I'm surprised trolls hadn't attacked Hogsmeade before. Idiotic beasts have no sense whatsoever. Deserve what they got.",
  "PhineasBlack_11049": "Hogwarts was never in danger. The castle is and always has been well-protected under my stewardship.",
  "PhineasBlack_11050": "I hear you completed the 'Field Guide' Professor Weasley arranged for you. Least you managed to get something done this year.",
  "PhineasBlack_11051": "Miss Onai does tend to wander off, from what I understand. You'd do well to encourage her to stay close to the castle.",
  "PhineasBlack_11052": "I shall never understand Miss Sweeting's interest in beasts. They serve for potion ingredients, the occasional overcoat – but not much else.",
  "PhineasBlack_11053": "Mr Sallow seems to have a good head on his shoulders. You could do worse for a friend.",
  "PhineasBlack_11054": "You've been stargazing with Mr Thakkar, I hear. I do wonder if that's the best use of your time.",
  "PhineasBlack_11055": "I suspect Miss Reyes does not suffer fools gladly. It's a wonder she's made such time for you.",
  "PhineasBlack_11056": "Mr Clopton is not known for his good judgement. I spy one more Dungbomb in these halls and I shall come after the pair of you.",
  "PhineasBlack_11057": "Interesting display. I should be a bit more careful about using such magic in the castle, if I were you.",
  "PhineasBlack_11059": "No idea how you found yourself involved in the failed coup beneath the castle, but, you didn't lose the battle so – well done. I suppose.",
  "PhineasBlack_11060": "Oh, someone's clearly begging for detention.",
  "PhineasBlack_11061": "If you pay as little attention in class as to the world around you, I confess, I worry for your O.W.L.s.",
  "PiersPemberton_10048": "Not sure what happened, but evidently there was quite a commotion out at the Tower north of Hogsmeade.",
  "PiersPemberton_10049": "Why would anyone care enough to remove my Demiguise statues?",
  "PiersPemberton_10050": "What? Who are you? Why do you ask?",
  "PiersPemberton_10051": "Thank you. A lot of craftsmanship and care went into them. I assume.",
  "PiersPemberton_10052": "Ha! Good. That was the idea.",
  "PiersPemberton_10053": "I – Yes. I did. It was a ploy to give that pathetic oaf Moon a taste of the grief he caused me years ago.",
  "PiersPemberton_10054": "Even when we were at school he was a cowardly bully. Gave me a horrible nickname – which I shan't repeat.",
  "PiersPemberton_10055": "It was too much. Even if I do take satisfaction in that his life's destiny was to be a lowly caretaker.",
  "PiersPemberton_10057": "I know. You should've seen his face when that Boggart appeared. Priceless! That's when I knew what I needed to do.",
  "PiersPemberton_10060": "I simply didn't want to encounter him anymore. So I shrewdly put a Boggart in his path, to learn his greatest fear.",
  "PiersPemberton_10061": "It worked brilliantly – until you started clearing them out.",
  "PiersPemberton_10065": "(sighs) Fair point, I suppose. If they've terrified him as you say, he may have learnt his lesson.",
  "PiersPemberton_10066": "I was thrilled when we left school and he seemed gone for good. Then I started seeing him around Hogsmeade.",
  "PiersPemberton_10067": "They will pay for this. Those statues took time and effort.",
  "PiersPemberton_10068": "You are the one who's been pilfering them!",
  "PiersPemberton_10069": "Ahem. Ah. Well. Fitting Moon would enlist a student. Too cowardly to do it himself. Hasn't changed a bit.",
  "PiersPemberton_10070": "I then created the Demiguise statues to  keep him in his place, so to speak. The moons were an inspired play on his name.",
  "PiersPemberton_10071": "I suspect you are the one who has been interfering with a rather personal matter. The Demiguise statues – and the moons contained therein – were placed as they were for good reason. You should not meddle in the personal affairs of others.",

  "playerfemale_18844": "[[Never mind.]] Actually, perhaps another time.",
  "playerfemale_18845": "[[I focus best in a room that is dark and mysterious.]] I'd like the Room to feel mysterious and eerie, as if I'm in the Forbidden Forest, surrounded by shadows.",

  "playerfemale_19863": "[[My own shop and elf would be brilliant.]] Oh, it would be wonderful to have a place to sell things and someone to help me.",
  "playerfemale_19864": "[[I'll talk to your mistress.]] All right. I shall go and find Madam Mason.",
  "playerfemale_19865": "[[What could I sell?]] What kind of things would I be able to sell in the shop?",
  "playerfemale_19871": "It's my pleasure. You deserve it.",
  "playerfemale_20041": "I am indeed a student, but I could very well be able to help you.",

  "playerfemale_21859": "[[She was an innocent victim.]] I'm so sorry, Mr Dunne. She was an innocent victim.",
  "playerfemale_21861": "[[She was the victim of her own greed.]] It seems poor Mary was breeding spiders in her home for profit – and vastly underestimated their propensity to multiply.",
  "playerfemale_22313": "[[I'm ready to go.]] I'm eager to get to Hogsmeade.",
  "playerfemale_22320": "[[So there really is an Ollivanders here?]] There's an Ollivanders in Hogsmeade?",
  "playerfemale_22336": "[[Let's talk to the centaurs.]] Sounds as if we need to go and talk to the centaurs.",
  "playerfemale_22349": "[[I'm glad you understand.]] That's good to hear. It's a lot to take in all at once.",
  "playerfemale_22353": "Professor, what should I be doing again?",
  "playerfemale_22356": "[[Why not keep the egg?]] I don't suppose you've thought about keeping it, have you?",
  "playerfemale_22359": "Are you in some sort of trouble?",
  "playerfemale_22360": "[[Of course.]] Yes! I have some right here. Please, take it. And be careful.",
  "playerfemale_22361": "[[I don't have any.]] I'm afraid not. I'd help you if I could, but I don’t actually have anything with me.",
  "playerfemale_22362": "[[I don't believe you need it.]] You should be able to take care of yourself. I’m not giving you anything.",
  "playerfemale_22363": "Still looking for that Thunderbrew?",
  "playerfemale_22386": "[[That sounds simple enough.]] That sounds straightforward enough.",
  "playerfemale_22388": "[[This seems dangerous.]] You're making this sound simple. But, this is a dragon after all.",
  "playerfemale_22418": "[[I'm holding my own.]] Thank you, but I've been holding my own.",
  "playerfemale_22439": "[[Yes, Gryffindor.]] Yes!",

  "playerfemale_22442": "[[Yes, Slytherin.]] Yes!",
  "playerfemale_22443": "[[I belong in Gryffindor.]] I believe that Gryffindor is a better fit for me.",
  "playerfemale_22444": "[[I belong in Ravenclaw.]] I'm certain that Ravenclaw is the house for me.",

  "playerfemale_22681": "The moths match the shapes I saw on the door.",
  "playerfemale_22709": "[[Wait. Why am I here?]] Feenky, isn't it? I know I came in here for something. What was it?",
  "playerfemale_22747": "[[Of course.]] I can take the crest to Marmaduke's sarcophagus for you.",
  "playerfemale_22749": "[[Where did the curse come from?]] Why was Marmaduke's tomb cursed?",
  "playerfemale_22791": "Hello, Mr Dibble. I had a few more questions, if you don't mind.",
  "playerfemale_22803": "[[About the note –]] Could you give me a bit more detail about the note – that might help me to identify it should I come across it?",

  "playerfemale_22922": "You told me the librarian would be gone by now.",
  "playerfemale_22924": "[[Why do we need the key?]] Wait, why do we need a key? Isn't there a spell for this?",
  "playerfemale_22925": "[[Good idea.]] You distract; I get the key. Understood.",

  "playerfemale_22943": "[[What were you thinking?]] What on earth possessed you to do something like that?",
  "playerfemale_22963": "Thank you, Professor Hecat. Glad to have the opportunity to practise.",
  "playerfemale_22978": "[[I like the sound of that.]] Can't say no to that. What did you have in mind?",

  "playerfemale_23030": "Sebastian?",
  "playerfemale_23055": "[[She made me nervous.]] Honestly, she was a bit intimidating.",
  "playerfemale_23056": "[[Sounds intriguing.]] You've intrigued me. Very well, lead the way.",
  "playerfemale_23059": "[[Should I be worried?]] I'm not sure. What's this all about?",
  "playerfemale_23068": "[[He clearly needs help.]] How awful. I can see why you're upset; he definitely needs some help.",
  "playerfemale_23069": "[[He deserved it.]] If I'm honest, I'd say he had it coming.",

  "playerfemale_23135": "I'm happy to tell you that I returned the crest to Marmaduke's sarcophagus just as you asked.",
  "playerfemale_23136": "[[Nothing I couldn't handle.]] Just a measly old troll. Nothing significant.",
  "playerfemale_23137": "[[A troll almost killed me!]] Well, there was a troll in the tomb!",
  "playerfemale_23245": "Hello sir. I'm looking for –",

  "playerfemale_23382": "[[How about Natty?]] I'd like to go with Natty.",
  "playerfemale_23391": "[[I'll think about it.]] It does sound intriguing – but I need to consider my finances first. I'll come and find you if I'm interested.",
  "playerfemale_23402": "But what about curfew?",
  "playerfemale_23403": "Hello, Mr Moon. I have the moons you asked me to collect.",
  "playerfemale_23405": "[[I think I know all I need.]] I have nothing more to ask.",
  "playerfemale_23413": "[[I'm already exhausted.]] Wonderful. I can only imagine what we might find in there.",
  "playerfemale_23427": "[[I enjoyed it.]] Actually, I enjoyed it. I couldn't help but catch your enthusiasm.",
  "playerfemale_23443": "A sarcophagus. This must be Marmaduke.",
  "playerfemale_23444": "Should've known a Herbologist would use Devil's Snare.",
  "playerfemale_23446": "Well Marmaduke certainly left behind more than plants.",
  "playerfemale_23469": "[[Yes, I enjoyed the search.]] Yes, I rather enjoyed seeking him out.",
  "playerfemale_23471": "[[It was just an old skull.]] Why didn't you tell us it was just his skull?",
  "playerfemale_23504": "Poor Tobbs. Left here alone with the spiders.",
  "playerfemale_23506": "I am sorry to tell you this, Deek – but Tobbs is gone. It seems he was unable to avoid the spiders in the end.",
  "playerfemale_23508": "Did you say 'tickle the pear'?",
  "playerfemale_23524": "What seems to be the problem?",
  "playerfemale_23525": "Still in the market for an Invisibility Potion?",
  "playerfemale_23526": "[[I’m all out.]] I’m afraid I’m all out of Invisibility Potion. I suggest finding somewhere safe and being especially careful.",
  "playerfemale_23527": "[[I have some.]] Well, as it happens, I have what you need. Here. Not sure it'll help you though. Be careful, won't you?",
  "playerfemale_23528": "[[Your logic is flawed.]] The Grim, if you saw one, is an omen. Omens don't attack you. So I doubt an Invisibility Potion will do you much good.",
  "playerfemale_23529": "What is it? What’s wrong?",
  "playerfemale_23530": "Goblins got you yet? Or did you find some Maxima Potion?",
  "playerfemale_23531": "[[I don’t have any.]] I don’t have any of that. Perhaps you could try in Hogsmeade, or one of the hamlets?",
  "playerfemale_23532": "[[Here you go.]] You’re right; the world’s not safe at the moment. It’s best to take precautions. Here. Use it wisely.",
  "playerfemale_23533": "[[No charity.]] If you can’t defend yourself, you’d be better off staying out of their way. I’m not giving you charity.",
  "playerfemale_23534": "Everything all right?",
  "playerfemale_23535": "Not dead from that spider attack yet?",
  "playerfemale_23536": "[[I've run out.]] I was sure I had some, but it seems not. Afraid I'm not able to help. Good luck with the, er, spiders.",
  "playerfemale_23537": "[[I’ll help you.]] Spiders do tend to appear in ruins. Here, I have enough to spare. Stay away from the ruins though.",
  "playerfemale_23538": "[[You don't need it.]] You seem perfectly fine. Not a scratch. You don't need any Wiggenweld Potion.",
  "playerfemale_23544": "Officer Singer? I have some information you might be interested in.",
  "playerfemale_23545": "Cassandra Mason sold me her shop and then tried to drive me mad in a haunted dungeon.",
  "playerfemale_23604": "[[I'm game.]] If that's what I need to do to speak to Jackdaw, I'll do it.",

  "playerfemale_23618": "[[The shop looks a bit worse for wear.]] Why are the premises in such disarray?",
  "playerfemale_23629": "[[I'll go.]] It seems this may help us both. I shall do it.",

  "playerfemale_23646": "[[How did you lose your head?]] I think I can guess how you died – but who did it to you?",
  "playerfemale_23649": "Samantha, is everything all right?",
  "playerfemale_23657": "I brewed an Edurus Potion as you asked, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_23658": "Not much for the cold, are you?",
  "playerfemale_23662": "That sounds a bit – mysterious.",
  "playerfemale_23664": "I'm getting used to things. What about you? Do you finally feel settled?",
  "playerfemale_23668": "I believe you.",
  "playerfemale_23669": "I'll keep that in mind, Natty. Thank you.",
  "playerfemale_23681": "[[Let's go.]] Actually – why not? I can beat your record.",
  "playerfemale_23682": "[[Not now.]] I actually don’t have time for this right now. Perhaps another day.",
  "playerfemale_23683": "Still up for that broom contest?",
  "playerfemale_23689": "[[Let's go.]] I'm ready to fly.",
  "playerfemale_23690": "[[Not now. I'll come back later.]] Now's not the best time. I'll see if I can come back later.",
  "playerfemale_23699": "[[I'm ready for the challenge.]] We'll soon see how I fare, won't we? I'm ready.",
  "playerfemale_23700": "[[I'll be back later.]] Not just yet. Perhaps later? I’ll come back when I’m feeling up to it.",
  "playerfemale_23702": "We’re still on for the trial, aren't we?",
  "playerfemale_23712": "Glad I could be of service.",
  "playerfemale_23713": "So how did you manage to get on the librarian's bad side?",
  "playerfemale_23717": "Oh, is your sister in Slytherin too?",
  "playerfemale_23718": "But you can see them?",
  "playerfemale_23720": "A little. It's positively enormous.",
  "playerfemale_23721": "Oh? Any you'd like to share with the class?",
  "playerfemale_23722": "Has she? That's nice to hear.",
  "playerfemale_23724": "Pardon me, Professor. What am I supposed to do with the dittany seeds?",
  "playerfemale_23742": "[[That's kind of you to say.]] I've been fortunate. Beginner's luck.",
  "playerfemale_23754": "[[Why that wand?]] Is there anything special about the wand?",
  "playerfemale_23755": "[[Why did he steal it?]] Why would the thief have taken the wand?",
  "playerfemale_23767": "[[What's in the cave?]] What will I find in the cave?",
  "playerfemale_23768": "[[Who cut off your head?]] Did someone in the cave cut off your head?",
  "playerfemale_23866": "Professor Binns, I found the statue of Sir Affpuddle.",
  "playerfemale_23880": "Well, my feet didn't turn into beets. That's a good start.",
  "playerfemale_23881": "That should reverse the curse. Hopefully.",
  "playerfemale_23883": "Professor!",
  "playerfemale_23887": "[[I'm ready to leave now.]] Shall we?",
  "playerfemale_23888": "[[I'd like to explore before we leave.]] I think I'd like to look around a bit first.",
  "playerfemale_23889": "From the outside, you'd never guess this place even existed in here.",
  "playerfemale_23890": "[[I'm finished.]] I believe I am.",
  "playerfemale_23891": "[[I'm not finished.]] Not quite yet. Just a few more minutes.",

  "playerfemale_23919": "Poppy, where are you taking me?",
  "playerfemale_23942": "What's going on?",
  "playerfemale_23945": "Hello Professor. You wanted to speak with me?",
  "playerfemale_23946": "[[I enjoyed it.]] It was wonderful. I believe I'm really going to enjoy this class.",
  "playerfemale_23947": "[[Beasts make me nervous.]] It was all right, but honestly I find the beasts' unpredictability unnerving.",
  "playerfemale_23975": "[[Why did you take the wand?]] Why would you steal Mr Ollivander's family wand?",

  "playerfemale_24058": "Another shopkeeper? St Mungo's? I think you should explain, Penny.",
  "playerfemale_24087": "[[I'm terrified of spiders.]] You wouldn't know it by how many I've killed lately, but honestly I'm terrified of spiders.",
  "playerfemale_24088": "[[Spiders don't bother me at all.]] Spiders don't bother me at all. You'd be impressed by how many I've dispatched lately.",
  "playerfemale_24115": "Hello, Adelaide. How are you and your uncle doing?",
  "playerfemale_24119": "[[Thank you. How kind.]] That's very kind of you, Amit. Are you sure you won't need it?",

  "playerfemale_24148": "[[Welcome back.]] There you are – welcome back.",
  "playerfemale_24149": "[[Let's not insult the angels.]] I wouldn't go so far as to say that.",

  "playerfemale_24158": "[[I'd like to know more about Deek.]] Can you tell me a bit more about Deek?",
  "playerfemale_24160": "Can you tell me where I might find Grimbald Weft?",
  "playerfemale_24161": "Where can I find that friendly knight you mentioned earlier?",

  "playerfemale_24197": "Excuse me, Mr Sallow –",
  "playerfemale_24225": "Thank you, Miriam. For everything.",
  "playerfemale_24281": "I have the telescope. It's nicer than I had expected.",

  "playerfemale_24337": "Let's take a look around, Amit. See if we can find any plans.",
  "playerfemale_24344": "I am indeed.",
  "playerfemale_24352": "Look at the size of this mine. Lodgok, where are you?",
  "playerfemale_24353": "This place is teeming with Ranrok's Loyalists. I have to keep my wits about me.",
  "playerfemale_24354": "What came over Lodgok? Coming here alone.",
  "playerfemale_24355": "This cart ought to get me deeper into the mine.",
  "playerfemale_24356": "How deep will this take me, I wonder?",
  "playerfemale_24358": "That has to be the end up ahead.",
  "playerfemale_24360": "Just like Gringotts, but I'm in the driver's seat this time.",
  "playerfemale_24364": "I'd better light these boilers if I want to go any further.",
  "playerfemale_24365": "<i>Incendio</i> should be enough to light these flames.",

  "playerfemale_24654": "It looks as if Tobbs was here some time ago. He must have headed deeper into the cave.",
  "playerfemale_24672": "That didn't sound particularly reassuring.",
  "playerfemale_24677": "What do you think?",
  "playerfemale_24680": "Right. So back to your frame – ?",
  "playerfemale_24726": "They're even more aggressive than I'd expected.",

  "playerfemale_24790": "[[The shop looks a bit worse for wear.]] Why are the premises in such disarray?",
  "playerfemale_24791": "[[How did you become so good at selling?]] How are you so good at selling? Seems unusual for a house-elf?",
  "playerfemale_24792": "[[Not at all.]] I have a knack for this sort of thing, if I do say so myself. If I can meet your terms, I hope that you'll sell to me.",
  "playerfemale_24793": "[[My age is irrelevant if I have the money.]] I am quite capable of owning a shop, I can assure you. I should think you'd be happy to have a buyer.",
  "playerfemale_24794": "For what it's worth, she doesn't seem to have spotted us yet.",
  "playerfemale_24795": "Hmm. An 'exceedingly fair price' for a shop and an elf? What's the catch?",
  "playerfemale_24798": "From a distance.",
  "playerfemale_24799": "I don't suppose she'd listen to reason?",
  "playerfemale_24800": "I beg your pardon?",
  "playerfemale_24801": "There she is again.",
  "playerfemale_24802": "She isn't making it easy!",
  "playerfemale_24803": "Can't the curse be broken?",
  "playerfemale_24804": "Looks like everyone's gone. Better head to the common room.",
  "playerfemale_24810": "I suppose some introductions are in order.",
  "playerfemale_24821": "Thank you, Professor. But – what do you mean it will 'keep track' of what I'm learning?",
  "playerfemale_24823": "Hmm. A small favour in exchange for getting those pages?",
  "playerfemale_24824": "I beg your pardon – roast beef? Rotten roast beef?",
  "playerfemale_24827": "[[He was out of line.]] I'll admit I wasn't expecting him to be so angry.",
  "playerfemale_24832": "[[He's not that bad.]] Surely he can't be that terrible? Can he?",
  "playerfemale_24833": "[[I agree. He's awful.]] He truly is rather foul, isn't he?",
  "playerfemale_24834": "How lucky for us.",
  "playerfemale_24883": "What is it?",
  "playerfemale_24885": "Let's hurry.",
  "playerfemale_24908": "Yes, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_24928": "Pardon me, Mr Sallow.",
  "playerfemale_24944": "How is that?",
  "playerfemale_24945": "What is this place?",
  "playerfemale_24953": "Where are we, Deek?",
  "playerfemale_24959": "Not powerful enough. Perhaps <i>Depulso</i> will do.",
  "playerfemale_24974": "[[You did the right thing.]] You did what you had to do.",
  "playerfemale_24981": "I never thought I'd see the inside of Azkaban for myself.",
  "playerfemale_24988": "[[What precisely did you see in the stars?]] You said you 'divined a series of events' before our paths crossed. What were they?",
  "playerfemale_24989": "[[How do you know the symbol is where the Snidgets are?]] What makes you so sure the symbol is where the Snidgets are?",
  "playerfemale_24996": "I hope Adelaide's Uncle Rowland is all right. She seems very worried.",
  "playerfemale_24998": "Adelaide said that her uncle kept notes of his trades – maps. Perhaps these landmarks will lead me to him.",
  "playerfemale_24999": "This is the spot on the map. I'd best have my wits about me.",
  "playerfemale_25024": "Professor, I completed all of your most recent assignments.",
  "playerfemale_25028": "I finished the tasks, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_25030": "I've finished the activities you assigned me, Professor Garlick.",
  "playerfemale_25032": "Reporting back, Professor. Assignments all finished.",
  "playerfemale_25036": "[[I regret using <i>Crucio</i>.]] I know we had to do it to open the scriptorium, but it's not something I'd want to repeat.",
  "playerfemale_25037": "[[I agree, we did what we had to.]] It was hard to do, but casting <i>Crucio</i> was our only option.",
  "playerfemale_25043": "[[I believe I do.]] Yes. An unsuccessful shop would be bad for nearby businesses, I'd imagine.",
  "playerfemale_25044": "[[Why would you assume that I'll fail?]] Ha. Your faith in me is overwhelming. You're sorely mistaken if you think I'm going to fail.",
  "playerfemale_25059": "Greetings! I mean, out of my way, children.",
  "playerfemale_25060": "You call that a shine on those boots? Do better.",
  "playerfemale_25061": "Chewing with your mouth open? Where are your manners?",
  "playerfemale_25062": "Ahem! I wonder almost daily why I accepted this appointment from the Ministry.",
  "playerfemale_25063": "[[She did, indeed.]] Well, yes. She said she did. But I think you might have missed the bit about the dungeon.",
  "playerfemale_25064": "[[Why are you surprised?]] I am perfectly capable of owning a shop. But, more importantly, did you not hear the bit about the dungeon?",
  "playerfemale_25081": "Yes, what is it?",
  "playerfemale_25089": "I actually have some moons for you.",
  "playerfemale_25096": "Hello, Mr Moon.",
  "playerfemale_25109": "[[Why the toast?]] Why did I need the toast to get in here?",
  "playerfemale_25188": "I hope that house-elf can find us in here.",
  "playerfemale_25247": "It's my first time in Hogsmeade actually.",
  "playerfemale_25259": "No, that's not Grimbald Weft.",
  "playerfemale_25260": "Hmm, interesting. But not Grimbald Weft.",
  "playerfemale_25262": "[[Can you see anything from your other frame?]] I don't suppose you have any idea where your stolen frame was taken? Can you see anything from it?",
  "playerfemale_25286": "Oh, no. I have a feeling that house-elf is Tobbs.",
  "playerfemale_25295": "You do know he's screaming in the library as we speak.",
  "playerfemale_25354": "Remind me of the password to my office.",
  "playerfemale_25355": "[[You dare question me?]] How dare you question me? I've a mind to give you a matching set of ears.",
  "playerfemale_25356": "[[I've changed my mind.]] And now I'm telling you that you can tell me.",
  "playerfemale_25358": "Hmm. Right. Of course. I –",
  "playerfemale_25359": "[[It's to do with strength.]] Certainly I remember. It's still 'Stronger Together,' no?",
  "playerfemale_25360": "[[It's to do with my family's reign.]] Of course I remember. It's 'the Black Family Reigns.'",
  "playerfemale_25361": "[[It's to do with purity of blood.]] It's 'purebloods forever' – isn't it?",
  "playerfemale_25362": "Ha! Thank you. Never speak of this conversation with me or anyone else.",
  "playerfemale_25364": "Whatever you wish, Scrope. It's your – treasure.",
  "playerfemale_25401": "Thank you, Natty.",
  "playerfemale_25402": "Thank you.",
  "playerfemale_25403": "Thank you very much.",
  "playerfemale_25454": " How does anyone other than a house-elf manage to get around in here?",
  "playerfemale_25478": "All thanks to Professor Fig's quick thinking. Now what?",
  "playerfemale_25479": "[[Sebastian went too far.]] Sebastian acted rashly, but he acted out of instinct to save Anne.",
  "playerfemale_25481": "[[Sebastian saved his sister.]] Sebastian and I have encountered Ranrok's Loyalists before. That goblin would've killed Anne.",
  "playerfemale_25498": "Professor Weasley said I should ask you about changing the Room's ambiance.",
  "playerfemale_25499": "[[A cool, moonlit ambience sounds perfect.]] I would like the Room to feel as if it's being lit by the moon.",
  "playerfemale_25500": "[[I'd like something natural and earthy.]] I'd like the Room to feel natural and earthy, as though I'm outdoors.",
  "playerfemale_25501": "[[I'd like it to feel warm and cosy.]] I'd like the Room to be warm and comfortable – as if I'm floating inside a mug of Butterbeer.",
  "playerfemale_25502": "[[I focus best in a room that is dark and mysterious.]] I'd like the Room to feel mysterious and eerie, as if I'm in the Forbidden Forest, surrounded by shadows.",
  "playerfemale_25506": "You don't think the rumours about the cave are true, do you?",
  "playerfemale_25507": "Shall we take a closer look?",
  "playerfemale_25509": "I beg your pardon?",
  "playerfemale_25510": "'Scrope'? Who is Scrope?",
  "playerfemale_25511": "Pumpkins? Ah. I think I know just the place.",
  "playerfemale_25513": "[[Hand them over.]] I must insist that you give them to me at once.",
  "playerfemale_25514": "Or just raring for a fight.",
  "playerfemale_25515": "It's a little too warm if you ask me.",
  "playerfemale_25516": "I'm doing my best!",
  "playerfemale_25518": "No, it's not. It's the Hog's Head.",
  "playerfemale_25545": "Hello, Deek. You'll be pleased to know that a little Thestral was born.",
  "playerfemale_25549": "Hello Deek. You wanted to talk to me?",
  "playerfemale_25552": "[[I could burn you.]] I could just burn you and be done with it.",
  "playerfemale_25561": "I've completed all of my tasks, Professor Onai.",
  "playerfemale_25610": "Deek, could you remind me where I need to go to find the phoenix?",
  "playerfemale_25626": "Let's get you back to the Room. Deek's going to be pleased.",
  "playerfemale_25627": "Yes, Deek. And I rescued it from the poachers. I have it here. It's safe.",
  "playerfemale_25636": "[[What might I encounter in the tomb?]] Don't suppose you have any idea what could be waiting for me inside the tomb?",
  "playerfemale_25671": "Yes sir.",
  "playerfemale_25681": "'Toujours pur.'",
  "playerfemale_25688": "Ugh. I suppose I can do that. But why me?",
  "playerfemale_25689": "Lodgok. The sarcophagus had been raided. I found no helmet – only a dead Ashwinder.",
  "playerfemale_25708": "I'll say.",
  "playerfemale_25709": "We'll see about that.",
  "playerfemale_25726": "Gah! These Inferi are horrible.",
  "playerfemale_25727": "They're certainly persistent.",
  "playerfemale_25728": "Stay back!",
  "playerfemale_25729": "Perhaps <i>Accio</i> would help.",
  "playerfemale_25730": "Need to get that platform closer – but how?",
  "playerfemale_25731": "If only I could pull it to within reach.",
  "playerfemale_25734": "It's sealed shut from the other side.",
  "playerfemale_25735": "Oh!",
  "playerfemale_25738": "This is pointless. I need to go.",
  "playerfemale_25739": "I must unseal that door mechanism to escape.",
  "playerfemale_25762": "Intra muros.",
  "playerfemale_25768": "Hello. I'm here to help. I can take you somewhere safe.",
  "playerfemale_25818": "I know.",
  "playerfemale_25820": "Rather good at this, aren't you?",
  "playerfemale_25821": "You're not going to make this easy, are you?",
  "playerfemale_25832": "Nothing lucky about it.",
  "playerfemale_25834": "Scrope!",
  "playerfemale_25839": "I haven't time for any of you at the moment. None. None at all. Move aside.",
  "playerfemale_25840": "If you must speak with me, consult my secretaries, or, uh, what have you. Now, move along.",
  "playerfemale_25848": "Oh, I – uh – places to be, Professor Sharp. Places to be.",
  "playerfemale_25853": "Has anyone seen my ivory-handled hand mirror? Of course you haven't.",
  "playerfemale_25854": "When I witness what passes for magic in these halls, I – er – I simply mourn for the future of the wizarding world.",
  "playerfemale_25855": "Stand proud, purebloods. The future is yours.",
  "playerfemale_25856": "I did? I did. Yes. Well, spit it out, Sharp. I don't have all day.",
  "playerfemale_25886": "The phoenix!",
  "playerfemale_25920": "[[It may have been the wrong choice.]] There was little time to react, but it was an Unforgivable Curse.",
  "playerfemale_25925": "I have been thinking about something Professor Howin said in Beasts class – that I should study as many beasts as I can on my own time.",
  "playerfemale_25926": "But what is 'it'?",
  "playerfemale_25927": "Excuse me, Professor, could you remind me what my assignments were about?",
  "playerfemale_25972": "So far, so good.",
  "playerfemale_25973": "Troll!",
  "playerfemale_25974": "Nothing like an angry troll to bring friends together.",
  "playerfemale_26033": "[[Well, then. Let's go.]] I'll help you find the letter, Natty.",
  "playerfemale_26035": "[[Can't we just go straight to the Ministry?]] Can't we just bypass Officer Singer and go directly to the Ministry?",
  "playerfemale_26036": "Natty, what's going on? Why are we all the way out here?",
  "playerfemale_26053": "Were you able to find the letter?",
  "playerfemale_26054": "It was exhilarating, wasn't it? I wasn't sure we were going to make it out alive.",
  "playerfemale_26066": "Thank you, Madam Thistlewood. I shall do my best.",
  "playerfemale_26069": "No one's been here for ages.",
  "playerfemale_26072": "No, that's not it.",
  "playerfemale_26073": "No. Hmmm. How did you do this, Jackdaw?",
  "playerfemale_26074": "It's no wonder Anne never found that clue.",
  "playerfemale_26075": "Ha! You'll not outfox me, Jackdaw.",
  "playerfemale_26076": "Oh! That's done something.",
  "playerfemale_26077": "Ah. I see how this goes.",
  "playerfemale_26078": "You couldn't outwit me, Jackdaw. Now, where's the clue you left behind?",
  "playerfemale_26079": "No, this isn't the one.",
  "playerfemale_26080": "This isn't quite right. I'd best keep searching.",
  "playerfemale_26081": "This must be the place Minister Diggory mentioned. Helen lives around here somewhere.",
  "playerfemale_26092": "Professor Sharp, could I ask you about my extra assignments?",
  "playerfemale_26093": "Professor, could you remind me of the purpose of the assignments you set for me?",
  "playerfemale_26094": "[[What is the purpose of my tasks?]] Please, could you remind me the purpose of my tasks, Professor?",
  "playerfemale_26095": "Could you remind me of the reason for these extra assignments, Professor?",
  "playerfemale_26102": "I like to think I can be trusted,  but I suppose we'll find out.",
  "playerfemale_26151": "What would you like me to do next, Professor?",
  "playerfemale_26178": "I do hope Sebastian's all right.",
  "playerfemale_26181": "[[Why have others failed?]] It looks to be rather a mess. Why haven't other tenants been able to make a go of it there?",
  "playerfemale_26199": "You mean I'll actually be able to turn invisible?",
  "playerfemale_26229": "I'm looking forward to it.",
  "playerfemale_26230": "You were a Gryffindor?",
  "playerfemale_26233": "This is the entrance?",
  "playerfemale_26235": "I can be quite resourceful.",
  "playerfemale_26270": "[[It is stunning.]] It looks stunning, Lodgok. I see why you wanted it back.",
  "playerfemale_26271": "[[It looks like a helmet.]] It just looks like a helmet to me.",
  "playerfemale_26272": "[[Sounds unnecessarily dangerous.]] Surely another spell could be used to mince daisy roots. Why learn this one?",
  "playerfemale_26274": "You have a new spell to teach me, Professor?",
  "playerfemale_26275": "[[All went perfectly well, Professor.]] Yes, sir. Of course.",
  "playerfemale_26298": "[[She tried to kill us.]] That's rather generous, isn't it? She did try to kill us the entire time.",
  "playerfemale_26332": "Now to see what lies beyond.",
  "playerfemale_26333": "And now back to 'the face of stone and tendrils.'",
  "playerfemale_26369": "I wish I had better news about your uncle and Anne.",
  "playerfemale_26389": "Well, I – thank you Amit.",
  "playerfemale_26395": "Are you all right? Are you – holding your breath?",
  "playerfemale_26396": "She did, indeed.",
  "playerfemale_26401": "Madam Kogawa – about what happened in class –",
  "playerfemale_26435": "[[Of course. Pleasure doing business with you.]] Wonderful. Shall I head directly to the shop?",
  "playerfemale_26436": "[[I'm not sure about this.]] Wait a minute – 'brave'? Perhaps this isn't a good idea.",
  "playerfemale_26437": "[[Oh, all right, then.]] Ah, of course. And you're right. Shall I head directly to the shop, then?",
  "playerfemale_26438": "[[Actually, I think I'll pass.]] Now that I've considered it further, I'd rather not purchase the shop at this time.",
  "playerfemale_26520": "What should I be doing right now?",
  "playerfemale_26551": "[[I'll see what I can find.]] I'll have a look for you. You've certainly given me plenty to go on.",
  "playerfemale_26555": "[[I'll see what I can do.]] I'll try my very best, Mr Dunne.",
  "playerfemale_26571": "A ghost or a poltergeist? Hmm – A non-being can never have been.",
  "playerfemale_26590": "Grata Domum.",
  "playerfemale_26595": "[[I see power.]] I see good things. After all, the future's mine for the taking – and I shall take what I must.",
  "playerfemale_26601": "[[Why are you so terrified of spiders?]] Why is it you can't conquer your fear of spiders?",
  "playerfemale_26607": "Hello, how are you?",
  "playerfemale_26611": "[[Your uncle didn't want you at Hogwarts?]] Why did your uncle want to keep you from Hogwarts this year?",
  "playerfemale_26612": "[[Your uncle sounds awful.]] Your uncle sounds like a bit of a twit.",
  "playerfemale_26614": "[[I'm not sure.]] I honestly don't know, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_26615": "Brilliant!",
  "playerfemale_26637": "This was his old telescope? Looks practically brand new.",
  "playerfemale_26662": "A blockade. Rookwood's poachers are already here.",
  "playerfemale_26666": "More poachers? How many are there?",
  "playerfemale_26670": "If Mary was breeding these things in her cellar – that means there are more underground.",
  "playerfemale_26671": "I'll need to destroy every last spider in that cellar if this is to end.",
  "playerfemale_26672": "This cellar gate looks to be locked. I'll need a key to enter.",
  "playerfemale_26673": "If this was where Mary bred the spiders, they're not here now.",
  "playerfemale_26674": "I hate to think that they see me – but I don't see them.",
  "playerfemale_26676": "Egg sacs! I need to find and destroy all of these before the situation gets even worse.",
  "playerfemale_26713": "Mr Gaunt. Where do you think you're going?",
  "playerfemale_26714": "Taking the day off, eh? Typical student, wasting the hours away.",
  "playerfemale_26715": "Garreth, er, Mr Weasley, what are you doing here? Don't you have – er –somewhere to be?",
  "playerfemale_26716": "I'm looking for my house-elf. Surely you've seen him.",
  "playerfemale_26723": "[[It was. Never used my wand in combat.]] In fact, it was. Perhaps I have a knack for it.",
  "playerfemale_26724": "[[I've had my share of wand combat.]] I've duelled enough. Consider yourself lucky I held back.",
  "playerfemale_26725": "Where am I? Professor Fitzgerald? Can you hear me?",
  "playerfemale_26729": "Highwing!",
  "playerfemale_26732": "Understandable. But why don't you check on her yourself?",
  "playerfemale_26733": "I am sorry about your friend. But you'll be relieved to know that I cleared out the spiders. It's safe to return now.",
  "playerfemale_26736": "Well this isn't a good sign. These spiders have gone somewhere.",
  "playerfemale_26742": "[[Indeed you don't!]] That's the spirit. I wish you the best of luck.",
  "playerfemale_26743": "[[It's not a pretty sight.]] Even so, you'll want to prepare yourself. The place needs something of a – clean up.",
  "playerfemale_26751": "Highwing!",
  "playerfemale_26752": "Blast it.  There's got to be another way to get up to the roof – somewhere.",
  "playerfemale_26754": "[[I see triumph.]] There will be hardship, I'm sure of it. But I see triumph in the end.",
  "playerfemale_26755": "[[I sense danger.]] I can't get rid of this feeling of a coming – danger.",
  "playerfemale_26756": "[[I visited the Owlery.]] Greetings, Mr Ollivander. I visited the Owlery as you suggested.",
  "playerfemale_26757": "It was. But – I don't think either of us could have predicted where I'd end up.",
  "playerfemale_26758": "I met the ghost of Richard Jackdaw himself. He pointed me to the cave where he died, wand in hand.",
  "playerfemale_26763": "Password?",
  "playerfemale_26764": "Hello, Natty. How are you?",
  "playerfemale_26765": "[[Herbology is a fascinating class.]] I never thought magical plants could be so thrilling.",
  "playerfemale_26766": "[[I prefer Charms class, actually.]] I will say that Herbology wasn't as much fun as Charms.",
  "playerfemale_26780": "Thank you, Officer Singer.",
  "playerfemale_26781": "Thank you, Poppy. I'll be gentle.",
  "playerfemale_26782": "I don't know, but they don't look particularly appetising to me.",
  "playerfemale_26794": "Natty, I have some questions.",
  "playerfemale_26795": "[[What do I need to do again?]] Natty, what do I need to do again?",
  "playerfemale_26796": "[[What are your reasons for going after Rookwood and Harlow?]] You seem to be very determined in stopping Rookwood and Harlow. Why?",
  "playerfemale_26803": "[[All right.]] Challenge accepted then.",
  "playerfemale_26804": "[[I don’t want your respect.]] I don’t want respect from the likes of you. All you do is insult people.",
  "playerfemale_26805": "[[Absolutely. Let's go.]] Ready when you are.",
  "playerfemale_26806": "[[Changed your mind about me?]] Does this mean you've changed your mind about me?",
  "playerfemale_26807": "[[Scared everyone else away?]] So – what? You finally scared everyone else away?",
  "playerfemale_26812": "I did indeed find your family wand, but it was in pieces – beyond repair.",
  "playerfemale_26820": "He didn't want you to identify him.",
  "playerfemale_26838": "Now, to find out what happened here.",
  "playerfemale_26839": "A rock formation? That's the first landmark on this map. Now to find the crooked tree.",
  "playerfemale_26840": "A crooked tree, just as the map said. The crumbling tower shouldn't be far from here.",
  "playerfemale_26841": "And the crumbling tower. The spot on the map should be directly south of here.",
  "playerfemale_26842": "Ah. Yes. Mixed with, um, Bubotuber pus makes a fine, er, moustache paste, yes, moustache paste, I find.",
  "playerfemale_26844": "I assure you I am quite healthy, Gaunt. If I need a medical diagnosis, I shall head to St Mungo's.",
  "playerfemale_26845": "I hear you're getting quite good at those concoctions you brew.",
  "playerfemale_26846": "I am watching you, Mr Weasley. Mr Redding, who owns Honeydukes, tells me some of his Billywig stings recently went missing.",
  "playerfemale_26847": "On your way, Mr Weasley.",
  "playerfemale_26865": "What nonsense! Uh – that you would trivialise the health of a student over a silly game.",
  "playerfemale_26866": "[[Please do.]] Good idea. I can even provide the parchment should you need it. Now where is my elf?",
  "playerfemale_26879": "Please, go on.",
  "playerfemale_26900": "[[I'll go again.]] I'm ready to give it another go.",
  "playerfemale_26901": "Hello again, Imelda. This course is a bit far from the castle, isn't it?",
  "playerfemale_26932": "Those marks. They look like the ones over the door.",
  "playerfemale_26933": "I know just the spell to pull that free.",
  "playerfemale_26973": "Ah. Then I am glad to be rid of it myself.",
  "playerfemale_27051": "You are a fierce one.",
  "playerfemale_27052": "I don't think I can take much more of this.",
  "playerfemale_27053": "Well, that doesn't work!",
  "playerfemale_27061": "That ought to give Professor Fig some breathing room.",
  "playerfemale_27062": "I received your owl. What happened with Ominis?",
  "playerfemale_27079": "[[That's incredible.]] Now the nickname makes sense. What an extraordinary ability to have.",
  "playerfemale_27080": "[[How did you become an Animagus?]] Were you born an Animagus or did you learn to become one?",
  "playerfemale_27083": "[[Do you choose your Animagus form?]] Can you choose what form your Animagus will take?",
  "playerfemale_27084": "[[What does it feel like?]] How does it feel to transform into an animal?",
  "playerfemale_27101": "And you declined?",
  "playerfemale_27126": "Ready?",
  "playerfemale_27127": "<i>Crucio!</i>",
  "playerfemale_27128": "I'm ready.",
  "playerfemale_27129": "Aaarrrghhhh!",

  "playerfemale_28575": "What is it?",
  "playerfemale_28577": "Thank you, Garreth. So am I.  Are you related to Professor Weasley?",
  "playerfemale_28579": "[[That must be nice.]] Must be nice having an aunt for a professor.",
  "playerfemale_28580": "[[Then you can do whatever you want.]] You must be able to get away with anything.",
  "playerfemale_28587": "Hello, Lenora. What are you looking at?",

  "playerfemale_28636": "Honeydukes. I can smell the chocolate.",
  "playerfemale_28647": "Now, where would I find the dried Billywig stings for Garreth?",
  "playerfemale_28650": "[[You heard correctly.]] He did say that. He wants me to get more ingredients to brew another potion.",
  "playerfemale_28652": "I suspect that is where I come in.",
  "playerfemale_28655": "Here's the Fwooper feather you wanted.",
  "playerfemale_28656": "That was an interesting class.",

  "playerfemale_28715": "It appears I won't be going up there.",
  "playerfemale_28727": "[[It was terrifying.]] It's true, and I was almost killed. Professor Fig and I were lucky to escape with our lives.",
  "playerfemale_28728": "[[It's true.]] Yes. Our carriage was attacked by a dragon.",
  "playerfemale_28737": "I'm here about the new spell you wanted to teach me, Professor.",

  "playerfemale_28749": "[[Actually, I might just keep this.]] Now that I think about it, 'Puffskein Dunkein,' I think I shall keep this. You need to overcome your cowardice.",
  "playerfemale_28750": "[[Happy to help. Take it.]] Of course. I hope this helps you prove yourself.",
  "playerfemale_28751": "You wanted to speak with me?",
  "playerfemale_28752": "Can you remind me of our arrangement?",
  "playerfemale_28757": "[[I'll see what I can do.]] Very well. If I'm in the area, perhaps I shall take a look.",

  "playerfemale_28766": "[[Very well.]] I'm in. Let's do it.",
  "playerfemale_28767": "[[Not right now.]] Perhaps another time.",
  "playerfemale_28768": "[[I'm game.]] I'm game for another round.",
  "playerfemale_28769": "[[Not now.]] Another time, perhaps.",

  "playerfemale_28784": "[[Good game.]] You played a good game, though, Grace.",
  "playerfemale_28785": "[[It was easy.]] There wasn't much to it.",
  "playerfemale_28786": "[[Yes.]] Let's have at.",
  "playerfemale_28787": "[[Not now.]] Perhaps another time.",
  "playerfemale_28788": "Hello. Are you here for Summoner's Court?",
  "playerfemale_28789": "[[Yes.]] Of course, Charlotte.",
  "playerfemale_28790": "[[Not now.]] Not at the moment, I'm afraid.",
  "playerfemale_28791": "[[I play by intuition.]] I play by intuition. Natural skill and all that.",
  "playerfemale_28792": "[[Practice.]] I practise as much as I can.",
  "playerfemale_28793": "[[I do, in fact.]] Absolutely. Don't count me out yet.",
  "playerfemale_28794": "[[Not now.]] Perhaps another time.",
  "playerfemale_28795": "Natty – I hope I haven't kept you waiting long.",
  "playerfemale_28796": "I've been looking forward to it.",
  "playerfemale_28797": "Hello, Sebastian.",
  "playerfemale_28799": "Really?",
  "playerfemale_28800": "I'm not going anywhere with you!",
  "playerfemale_28801": "Tell Rookwood to find me himself!",

  "playerfemale_28806": "[[Very well.]] I'm ready.",
  "playerfemale_28807": "[[Not now.]] Perhaps another time, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_28808": "[[I'm a natural.]] I suppose there's not much left you can teach me now.",
  "playerfemale_28809": "[[Yes.]] I would. I'd like a chance to improve my record.",
  "playerfemale_28810": "[[Not now.]] Not at the moment.",
  "playerfemale_28812": "What is the reason for these additional assignments, Professor?",
  "playerfemale_28813": "[[I've completed my assignments.]] I've completed my assignments, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_28816": "I completed your assignments, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_28837": "Could you remind me about the reason for the assignments you gave me, Professor?",
  "playerfemale_28838": "I completed your assignment, Professor. I'm ready to learn <i>Bombarda</i> now.",
  "playerfemale_28840": "What was the purpose of these assignments again, Professor?",
  "playerfemale_28841": "Madam Kogawa, I completed the list of tasks you assigned.",
  "playerfemale_28842": "It is. I haven't left the castle since I arrived.",
  "playerfemale_28844": "As am I. Thank you, by the way.",
  "playerfemale_28847": "[[How extraordinary.]] Merlin – of the legend of King Arthur?",

  "playerfemale_28871": "First, let me thank you for what you did in the library.",
  "playerfemale_28872": "It's well disguised.",
  "playerfemale_28875": "I think I've got it.",
  "playerfemale_28884": "Oh, hello. Ominis, isn't it? I believe we have Potions together. And – Herbology?",
  "playerfemale_28886": "[[Sebastian showed me.]] Actually, Sebastian brought me there. But he made it perfectly clear to keep quiet about it.",
  "playerfemale_28890": "You wanted to speak with me, Professor?",
  "playerfemale_28893": "Let's get you back to your frame, little moth.",
  "playerfemale_28894": "The moth stopped. Perhaps I need to keep casting <i>Lumos</i> on it.",
  "playerfemale_28895": "Ashwinders –",
  "playerfemale_28897": "Lenora, I solved the mystery of that painting.",
  "playerfemale_28898": "Ha! I knew there was a connection.",
  "playerfemale_28899": "I should tell Lenora that I solved the puzzle of that empty frame.",
  "playerfemale_28901": "Hmph. A moth. That frame was decorated with moths. I wonder if this one belongs there.",
  "playerfemale_28904": "Thank you. Nice to meet you – was that your cat?",
  "playerfemale_28905": "[[Shame. I think magical beasts are incredible.]] I'm sorry to hear that. I think magical beasts are rather incredible.",
  "playerfemale_28906": "[[I tend to agree with your mother.]] Your mother's right. Magical beasts are more trouble than they're worth.",
  "playerfemale_28910": "[[I'm sorry about that.]] I'm sorry, Professor. I was merely trying to help a friend.",
  "playerfemale_28912": "[[Why do you want to know?]] Yes, but why does that matter to you?",
  "playerfemale_28913": "[[I can get you that feather.]] I'll get you the Fwooper feather, as long as you're certain Sharp won't miss it.",
  "playerfemale_28919": "Strange to think one could be led by butterflies.",
  "playerfemale_28920": "I know the Forest is forbidden, but surely it can't be that dangerous.",
  "playerfemale_28921": "Ha – there they are. She wasn't making it up.",
  "playerfemale_28922": "Well, we've come this far. Miss Willardsey might get an answer about these butterflies.",
  "playerfemale_28923": "Well, well. Look what we have here –",
  "playerfemale_28924": "Pardon me, but were you saying something?",
  "playerfemale_28934": "Hello Miss Willardsey.",
  "playerfemale_28935": "[[Yes. And I was well rewarded.]] They led me into the Forest and revealed a treasure.",
  "playerfemale_28936": "[[Yes. Nothing exciting I'm afraid.]] I did. And I followed them into the Forest, but I'm afraid there was nothing to see.",
  "playerfemale_28941": "Ah yes. We met in the common room.",
  "playerfemale_28946": "[[I thought Merlin was a myth.]] I thought that Merlin and the tales about King Arthur's court were mere myth.",
  "playerfemale_29170": "Is everything all right?",
  "playerfemale_29175": "Can you remind me what you needed help with again?",
  "playerfemale_29177": "Now, which way is the common room?",
  "playerfemale_29187": "[[How fascinating.]] I can see why you're so interested in Merlin. I'd be keen to know more about the Trials.",
  "playerfemale_29188": "[[Seems a bit tedious.]] I'm not sure old vine-covered pillars are worth studying.",
  "playerfemale_29192": "I have the mallowsweet.",
  "playerfemale_29193": "The flames make the pyre sink.",
  "playerfemale_29199": "Hello, Arthur. What was it we were going to do?",
  "playerfemale_29204": "Hello, Arthur. Thought you might like to know that my map led to a doorway hidden within a portrait.",
  "playerfemale_29214": "Pardon me, is everything all right?",
  "playerfemale_29215": "I'm afraid I don't follow – who spoiled things? Also, what bells?",
  "playerfemale_29216": "[[I might be able to help with the bells.]] Perhaps I could help put the bells back up.",
  "playerfemale_29217": "[[What's so important about the bells?]] Is it really that important that the bells go back up?",
  "playerfemale_29218": "[[Did Professor Black really remove the bells for a headache?]] It's certainly an odd decree, even for Black – taking down the bells for a headache.",
  "playerfemale_29219": "[[Why can't you put the bells up yourself?]] If only two bells are left, isn't it fairly easy to tell which goes where?",
  "playerfemale_29223": "About the bells, Evangeline –",
  "playerfemale_29224": "The bells are back up, Evangeline.",
  "playerfemale_29226": "Deek, Professor?",
  "playerfemale_29229": "I'll take that, thank you.",
  "playerfemale_29244": "Hello, Deek. Shall we continue?",
  "playerfemale_29246": "Hello, Deek. Is this the clearing you mentioned?",
  "playerfemale_29248": "Fixtures?",
  "playerfemale_29249": "Mallowsweet?",
  "playerfemale_29250": "It's a long story. But – thank you for your help.",
  "playerfemale_29251": "[[Research. How interesting.]] You're a researcher?",
  "playerfemale_29271": "They seem to be going deeper into the Forest.",
  "playerfemale_29272": "I wonder where they're going – ?",
  "playerfemale_29276": "[[I'm sure you'll get it.]] Don't worry, you'll get it in the end.",
  "playerfemale_29277": "[[Perhaps you just need a bit more practice.]] A little more practice ought to do it.",
  "playerfemale_29278": "[[Your casting needs work.]] I'd say your wandwork could be a bit more fluid.",
  "playerfemale_29280": "Hope this isn't as precarious as it looks.",
  "playerfemale_29289": "[[I wish you luck.]] Well, good luck with it. It was nice to meet you, Cressida.",
  "playerfemale_29290": "[[How hard is it to cast nonverbal spells?]] Is it really that difficult to cast nonverbally?",
  "playerfemale_29295": "[[Nice meeting you, Garreth.]] Well, it was nice meeting you, Garreth. And thank you for the insights on your aunt.",
  "playerfemale_29296": "[[What's that in your mug?]] Are you having Butterbeer for breakfast?",
  "playerfemale_29298": "Goodness!",
  "playerfemale_29299": "[[Nice to meet you.]] I'm sure I'll be seeing you around – either in our common room or when you scale your next tower.",
  "playerfemale_29303": "[[What are people saying about my travels here?]] What exactly are the rumours about my journey to Hogwarts?",
  "playerfemale_29306": "I think I should turn around.",
  "playerfemale_29307": "I should probably turn back.",
  "playerfemale_29308": "Hm. Not sure this is the right way.",
  "playerfemale_29309": "Perhaps I should go the other way.",
  "playerfemale_29310": "This is not the right direction.",
  "playerfemale_29311": "Hm. Better turn around.",
  "playerfemale_29312": "This doesn't seem to be the right way.",
  "playerfemale_29313": "Perhaps the other way's more promising.",
  "playerfemale_29314": "Perhaps I'm heading the wrong way.",
  "playerfemale_29315": "Let's try the other way, perhaps.",
  "playerfemale_29316": "I should come back to this another time.",
  "playerfemale_29317": "I don't think I can do this now. Best to come back.",
  "playerfemale_29318": "Perhaps I'll come back to this.",
  "playerfemale_29319": "I don't think I'm ready for this just yet.",
  "playerfemale_29320": "I don't think I can tackle this just yet.",
  "playerfemale_29331": "[[Sounds intriguing.]] Exclusive and unsanctioned?  Count me in.",
  "playerfemale_29332": "[[Sounds suspicious.]] Unsanctioned? I don't know. School rules are in place for a reason.",
  "playerfemale_29380": "About what we discussed, Nerida –",
  "playerfemale_29391": "O.W.L.s? 'Owls'?",
  "playerfemale_29415": "[[You got me into trouble.]] Professor Sharp wasn't happy. Leave me out of your grand plans next time.",
  "playerfemale_29416": "[[It was nothing.]] Professor Sharp was annoyed but we sorted it out. No harm.",
  "playerfemale_29420": "These dry vines are one spark away from becoming kindling.",
  "playerfemale_29421": "This must be the entrance to the Hidden Herbology Corridor.",
  "playerfemale_29422": "Devil's Snare. Seems to thrive in darkness – perhaps it doesn't care for light.",
  "playerfemale_29423": "Seems the Devil's Snare was protecting a chest of some kind.",
  "playerfemale_29425": "I'm going to have to use <i>Accio</i> to get to those books.",
  "playerfemale_29426": "Got it. Only four more to go.",
  "playerfemale_29427": "That's the last book. Now to take them back to Cressida.",
  "playerfemale_29428": "[[That's amazing.]] That sounds brilliant, actually.",
  "playerfemale_29430": "[[Seems a lot of work just to carry books.]] That sounds a rather complicated way to simply avoid carrying your books.",
  "playerfemale_29432": "[[If I have time.]] I suppose I could help – if I have the time.",
  "playerfemale_29433": "Sebastian told me to see you about a club.",
  "playerfemale_29435": "[[I'll join your club.]] Of course. Duelling's an entertaining pastime.",
  "playerfemale_29436": "[[I'm not sure I'm interested.]] Don't really see the value in organised duelling. Senseless fighting, in my opinion.",
  "playerfemale_29442": "[[I'm ready.]] Get me in the ring.",
  "playerfemale_29443": "[[Not now.]] Perhaps later.",
  "playerfemale_29447": "Hello, Lucan. I wanted to talk to you about Crossed Wands.",
  "playerfemale_29450": "How does Crossed Wands work, exactly?",
  "playerfemale_29463": "[[They can be scary.]] Oh, they seem innocent but their tongues can be most disturbing.",
  "playerfemale_29464": "[[Are you afraid of your own shadow, too?]] Surely you're joking. You can't possibly be afraid of a Puffskein.",
  "playerfemale_29466": "[[I'm not serious.]] Only teasing. We had an arrangement.",
  "playerfemale_29467": "[[You'll learn a lesson from this.]] I'm doing you a favour. Disappointment like this will encourage you to become a stronger person.",
  "playerfemale_29468": "Professor Weasley?",
  "playerfemale_29470": "Hmm. Somewhere away from prying eyes.",
  "playerfemale_29486": "I imagine the bells are just inside in the Bell Tower.",
  "playerfemale_29487": "Ah – found them!",
  "playerfemale_29492": "It seems as if that might come in handy.",
  "playerfemale_29495": "[[No, sir. That's far too generous of you.]] That's very kind of you, Mr Hill, but I can't accept robes that I didn't pay for.",
  "playerfemale_29496": "[[Thank you, sir.]] Thank you, Mr Hill. That's very generous of you.",
  "playerfemale_29513": "[[I've had some good luck.]] I suppose it must seem that way. I'm not sure it's justified; it's often been a matter of circumstance.",
  "playerfemale_29515": "[[What's to be scared of?]] They're adorable. Why would you be afraid of a Puffskein?",
  "playerfemale_29516": "[[That's unkind.]] I'm sorry to hear that. Words can be cruel.",
  "playerfemale_29517": "[[That's actually funny.]] I'm sorry, but you have to admit that's rather clever.",
  "playerfemale_29518": "The 'Hidden Herbology Corridor'?",
  "playerfemale_29556": "Mr Weekes, I was able to set a record on my broom.",
  "playerfemale_29558": "Good news, Mr Weekes. With your upgrade, I was able to set a new record at the Irondale course.",
  "playerfemale_29559": "This looks like the portrait from the map. Now, where's the treasure?",
  "playerfemale_29560": "Ah, a rhinoceros skeleton. I'm on the right track.",
  "playerfemale_29561": "There's the fountain. I'm getting closer.",
  "playerfemale_29587": "Hello, Deek. Can you remind me how to use the nab-sack?",
  "playerfemale_29598": "What am I meant to be doing now, Deek?",
  "playerfemale_29600": "[[What if I can't find any beasts?]] What if I can't find any beasts in their usual habitat?",
  "playerfemale_29605": "[[I'll try to rescue a Jobberknoll.]] Then I shall go and rescue a Jobberknoll.",
  "playerfemale_29610": "Thank you.",
  "playerfemale_29624": "[[I already have one.]] I've already rescued one, actually. Do you have another beast in mind for today?",
  "playerfemale_29627": "Deek – what am I meant to be doing again?",
  "playerfemale_29644": "Thank you.",
  "playerfemale_29647": "[[I wish you had been there.]] Perhaps Professor Fig's friend would have survived if we'd had your help.",
  "playerfemale_29648": "[[We had it handled.]] We handled it. And, I think you're underestimating the nature of a dragon. A broom would've been kindling.",
  "playerfemale_29652": "Are you all right?",
  "playerfemale_29653": "[[I'm sorry to hear that.]] I'm sorry the other students weren't more friendly.",
  "playerfemale_29655": "[[Gobstones? Interesting.]] Gobstones? Sounds like a fun challenge.",
  "playerfemale_29656": "[[Sounds awful.]] I haven't much interest in a game that sprays you with odours.",
  "playerfemale_29659": "[[I can't make any promises.]] I'll see what I can do.",
  "playerfemale_29663": "[[Any ideas as to how to reach them?]]Do you have any suggestions on how to get your Gobstones down from their hiding spots?",
  "playerfemale_29666": "Hello, Zenobia. What did you need help with?",
  "playerfemale_29667": "[[Sounds as if they overreacted.]] Rather an overreaction on their part.",
  "playerfemale_29668": "[[I'd have done the same.]] Sounds as if you caused a smelly situation and they responded accordingly.",
  "playerfemale_29673": "[[Why does everyone hate you?]] Everyone hates you? Why?",
  "playerfemale_29674": "Hello, Zenobia. I found all your Gobstones.",
  "playerfemale_29675": "[[Yes, of course.]] Of course. They are yours, after all.",
  "playerfemale_29677": "[[No, I think I'll keep them.]] I'm afraid I've decided to keep them. That'll teach you to stink up your classmates.",
  "playerfemale_29678": "[[Wonderful idea.]] I'm sure they'd be willing to play after the trouble spent getting them back. It's a fine idea.",
  "playerfemale_29679": "[[Terrible idea.]] That's a horrible idea. No one wants to get that awful stench all over them again.",
  "playerfemale_29681": "Common sense and basic magic.",
  "playerfemale_29683": "[[No, I was only joking.]] I'm only teasing. Of course you can have them.",
  "playerfemale_29684": "[[Yes. I would.]] Yes. Finders keepers I'm afraid.",
  "playerfemale_29693": "[[Farewell, then.]] Goodbye, Imelda.",
  "playerfemale_29696": "This must be locked from the other side.",
  "playerfemale_29699": "The key. Here it is!",
  "playerfemale_29703": "Are potions really that versatile?",
  "playerfemale_29729": "He was a friend of Professor Fig's who merely joined us for the ride.",
  "playerfemale_29732": "[[Nice to meet you.]] It was nice meeting you, Sebastian. I'll let you get back to your book.",
  "playerfemale_29738": "[[What were you reading?]] What book were you reading?",
  "playerfemale_29739": "[[You seem to know a lot about wizard chess.]] Are you a keen wizard chess fan? You knew that boy was going to lose the match.",
  "playerfemale_29743": "Hmm. Perhaps I should have a chat with Ominis.",
  "playerfemale_29748": "A journal entry. Signed by Noctua Gaunt.",
  "playerfemale_29749": "The dial requires focus.",
  "playerfemale_29751": "Matching the symbols did open it.",
  "playerfemale_29752": "Another dial solved.",
  "playerfemale_29757": "We're making progress.",
  "playerfemale_29758": "This journal entry – it mentions getting lost and being unwelcome.",
  "playerfemale_29761": "Ominis – your aunt wanted to change your family's traditions.",
  "playerfemale_29765": "[[Do you fly a lot?]] Do you have a lot of time to fly during school?",
  "playerfemale_29768": "Ominis. A skeleton.  And Noctua's last journal entry. She mentions being trapped here – blocked by an Unforgivable Curse.",
  "playerfemale_29796": "I couldn't help but overhear – did you mention Ranrok's Loyalists?",
  "playerfemale_29797": "Has the situation with Ranrok's Loyalists improved?",
  "playerfemale_29804": "[[What happened to your brother?]] How did your brother Bardolph end up in St Mungo's?",
  "playerfemale_29805": "[[I could run them out.]] I'm unfortunately quite familiar with Ranrok's Loyalists. Perhaps I can do something.",
  "playerfemale_29808": "[[Where have the Loyalists set up camp?]] You said Ranrok's Loyalists have set up camp here. Where, precisely?",
  "playerfemale_29809": "[[Why don't you leave Upper Hogsfield?]] Why don't you simply leave the area for now?",
  "playerfemale_29811": "Hello Madam Beaumont. Good news – I was able to clear out Ranrok's camps.",
  "playerfemale_29812": "[[It was difficult.]] It was harrowing and they dug in their heels, but I managed.",
  "playerfemale_29818": "Excuse me – did you say something about a 'Bardolph Beaumont?'",
  "playerfemale_29819": "Excuse me Mrs Sprottle – any news on Bardolph Beaumont's disappearance?",
  "playerfemale_29820": "[[Perhaps I can keep an eye out.]] I can certainly look out for him.",
  "playerfemale_29825": "Strictly speaking, it has. We were caught.",
  "playerfemale_29828": "Madam Beaumont – might I speak with you?",
  "playerfemale_29829": "Madam Beaumont – any news regarding your brother, Bardolph?",
  "playerfemale_29830": "Mrs Sprottle told me a little about your brother's disappearance.",
  "playerfemale_29833": "[[I'll keep an eye out for him.]] I'll let you know if I see or hear anything about him.",
  "playerfemale_29837": "Past the river – near the Forest. I must be on the right track.",
  "playerfemale_29838": "Madam Beaumont? I believe I have some news of your brother.",
  "playerfemale_29839": "Madam Beaumont, I do have some news of your brother.",
  "playerfemale_29840": "[[I'm afraid he's dead.]] I regret to say that Bardolph had been turned into an Inferius. And – I had to kill him.",
  "playerfemale_29841": "[[He's decided to pursue a new life.]] I'm afraid he's joined the Ashwinders – and has no interest in returning.",
  "playerfemale_29843": "He was wearing a woollen jumper – hand-knitted.",
  "playerfemale_29844": "I'm truly sorry. I wish it had been better news. I wish you well, Madam Beaumont.",
  "playerfemale_29853": "Please, Ominis. I confided in you before about what happened with the Undercroft.",
  "playerfemale_29858": "After you, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_29878": "I officially have all of my supplies.",
  "playerfemale_29879": "Yes, dittany seeds, some spellcrafts and  some potion recipes.",
  "playerfemale_29881": "It worked! Ominis, you possess a rare ability indeed.",
  "playerfemale_29888": "[[I'll get your feather.]] Very well. I'll bring you a Fwooper feather.",
  "playerfemale_29890": "[[I should have helped you.]] It did sound like fun. I shouldn't have been so concerned with getting in trouble.",
  "playerfemale_29891": "[[I'm glad I didn't get involved.]] I'm glad I avoided trouble – Sharp certainly seemed upset with you.",
  "playerfemale_29893": "Noctua references painful and arduous challenges, but also rewards.",
  "playerfemale_29895": "[[I'd rather you ask him.]] You know him better than I do.",
  "playerfemale_29913": "[[Disrupted trade routes made you close?]] You said disrupted trade routes caused you to close Spintwitches?",
  "playerfemale_29918": "A new wand.",
  "playerfemale_29920": "Hello. Mr Weekes, is it?",
  "playerfemale_29942": "I – uh – that wasn't me, Professor. I'm new here.",
  "playerfemale_29945": "[[Bragbor. I know that name.]] Did you say Bragbor? I know that name. Lodgok said he was an ancestor of Ranrok.",
  "playerfemale_29950": "I came as soon as I could.",
  "playerfemale_29960": "[[Perhaps we can avoid detection.]] We need to see what they're doing, but let's not draw their attention.",
  "playerfemale_29961": "There they are up ahead.",
  "playerfemale_29964": "We make a good team.",
  "playerfemale_29967": "How nice. Nothing I haven't seen before.",
  "playerfemale_29969": "Fun is a relative term.",
  "playerfemale_29970": "Thank you, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_29985": "Once again, we could fight our way through – or be discreet.",
  "playerfemale_29986": "Perhaps we can find an alternate route up ahead.",
  "playerfemale_29991": "This mine looks like a tomb.",
  "playerfemale_30001": "Not at all. I'm choosing to see it all as one big adventure.",
  "playerfemale_30004": "I don't see any goblins in these webs.",
  "playerfemale_30009": "Too many. They definitely think there's something here they want.",
  "playerfemale_30010": "It's no wonder spiders give people goosebumps.",
  "playerfemale_30013": "Professor Hecat would be proud.",
  "playerfemale_30017": "We have another fight on our hands.",
  "playerfemale_30019": "Don't know why Gryffindors get credit for bravery. We Slytherins are teeming with it.",
  "playerfemale_30025": "Sebastian – I think I've found something! A canvas piece.",
  "playerfemale_30026": "Unless – we can find another passageway to the Undercroft. Let's have a look around.",
  "playerfemale_30029": "It has to fit.",
  "playerfemale_30036": "Please tell me you recognise the location in this bit of canvas.",
  "playerfemale_30037": "[[Have you ever encountered a dragon?]] I'd imagine most students have never seen a dragon. Have you?",
  "playerfemale_30038": "[[Could have gone worse.]] Well, I don't know about 'meticulous,' but I did as I was asked.",
  "playerfemale_30043": "I'm sorry – what do I need to do?",
  "playerfemale_30050": "[[It was nothing I couldn't handle.]] It is true. But I – we – handled it very well.",
  "playerfemale_30053": "Smashing.",
  "playerfemale_30072": "We're not finished yet.",
  "playerfemale_30084": "Excuse me?",
  "playerfemale_30085": "Oh. Well. Thank you.",
  "playerfemale_30086": "Didn't she stop that dragon skull from crushing you?",
  "playerfemale_30097": "How did you find this place?",
  "playerfemale_30102": "Really? Like what?",
  "playerfemale_30104": "[[It does sound dangerous.]] It sounds like a dangerous spell.",
  "playerfemale_30105": "[[That's ridiculous.]] A proper magical education ought to include all magic.",
  "playerfemale_30108": "Very well.",
  "playerfemale_30109": "It's a tad hot.",
  "playerfemale_30124": "Well, you took the fall for me. And that counts for something.",
  "playerfemale_30135": "[[Memorable? More like terrifying.]] I'd much rather have arrived on time and without a dragon attack en route.",
  "playerfemale_30136": "[[I do like to make an entrance.]] Well, if I'm going to make my mark here, I had to start right away.",
  "playerfemale_30137": "[[I'd be glad to help.]] It's definitely intriguing. I'd like to help you solve this mystery.",
  "playerfemale_30138": "[[If I have the time, but I make no promises.]] I'll see what I can do but I'm fairly busy. I can't promise anything.",
  "playerfemale_30144": "[[Nice meeting you.]] Thank you, Ominis. Very nice to meet you.",
  "playerfemale_30145": "[[Did you suspect you'd be in Slytherin?]] Were you expecting to be sorted into Slytherin?",
  "playerfemale_30146": "[[Do mermaids often appear outside the common room?]] Did that student say he thought he heard a mermaid?",
  "playerfemale_30148": "[[Why thank you.]] That's nice to hear. I have had my share of adventure. I hope my reputation's warranted.",
  "playerfemale_30150": "[[Hm. I suppose they could come in handy.]] I suppose they could prove useful outside of the greenhouse. Nothing wrong with a bit of backup. Even if it is from a cabbage.",
  "playerfemale_30151": "[[Sure, but that's just a dummy.]] Just because those cabbages will chomp on a dummy doesn't mean they'd do the same on, say, a goblin.",
  "playerfemale_30152": "[[I was imagining it already.]] Trust me Leander, I was imagining it the entire time.",
  "playerfemale_30159": "Yes, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_30160": "I tended to the Chinese Chomping Cabbages, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_30185": "What are we meant to be doing?",
  "playerfemale_30187": "[[Don't care much for plants, honestly.]] Thank you, Professor, but looking after plants isn't all that thrilling to me.",
  "playerfemale_30190": "Sounds lovely, but what I really need is this rotten roast beef.",
  "playerfemale_30194": "Not at all. Feenky sends her regards – along with the rotten roast beef.",
  "playerfemale_30196": "[[That's nice to hear.]] I'm flattered to hear that. Sebastian's not a bad duellist either.",
  "playerfemale_30198": "[[I did take him down a peg.]] I seem to have a knack for duelling.",
  "playerfemale_30200": "This is a change of pace from our last outing.",
  "playerfemale_30204": "I'm glad that Professor Weasley arranged for this visit to Hogsmeade.",
  "playerfemale_30205": "Whatever it was, it made very little sense.",
  "playerfemale_30206": "That's a powerful enchantment.",
  "playerfemale_30207": "I'll have to take your word for it, but that does sound disastrous.",
  "playerfemale_30208": "Neither do I, but he made a charming first impression.",
  "playerfemale_30209": "What were you and Ominis speaking about?",
  "playerfemale_30257": "<i>Stupefy</i> ought to make quick work of these pumpkins.",
  "playerfemale_30263": "[[Can most students cast nonverbally?]] Do most students know how to cast nonverbally?",
  "playerfemale_30285": "[[You don't mind students in here?]] Is it all right for students to wander into the kitchens?",
  "playerfemale_30286": "[[Are you restricted to certain foods?]] Are there any restrictions as to what you can make here?",
  "playerfemale_30287": "You're back.",
  "playerfemale_30288": "Listen, Professor. So much happened while you were away.",
  "playerfemale_30289": "Nearly Headless Nick asked me to get some rotten roast beef from the kitchens –",
  "playerfemale_30290": "Yes. And then I had to find Richard Jackdaw's head in the pumpkins so that he'd tell me about how he died.",
  "playerfemale_30291": "He was a student here long ago. Anyway, he told me about a secret cavern. I went there and, right next to Jackdaw's skeleton –",
  "playerfemale_30292": "Eldritch Diggory's portrait in the common room told me about his great-niece, Helen –",
  "playerfemale_30293": "Your friend, Mr Ollivander, sent me an owl asking for help finding an heirloom wand that was stolen from him –",
  "playerfemale_30294": "I received a flurry of messages from Professor Black's house-elf, Scrope.",
  "playerfemale_30295": "– I found the missing pages.",
  "playerfemale_30296": "[[I'd be happy to.]] Sounds simple enough. And who wouldn't want to go to Honeydukes?",
  "playerfemale_30297": "[[It sounds rather untoward.]] I don't know, Garreth. Secret passage to a cellar? Sounds like it's off-limits.",
  "playerfemale_30298": "[[Secret passage? Right up my street.]] Of course. You never know when you might need a quick means of escape from the castle.",
  "playerfemale_30300": "[[I can't wait to see what you brew up.]] You and your concoctions. I don't know how you come up with these things.",
  "playerfemale_30301": "[[Shouldn't you be studying?]] Where do you find the time for this – and your homework?",
  "playerfemale_30303": "[[I'll give it a try.]] I'll see what I can do, Garreth.",
  "playerfemale_30304": "What's down there?",
  "playerfemale_30306": "I wonder if Adelaide's uncle could be down there?",
  "playerfemale_30307": "Hello, Garreth. I have those dried Billywig stings.",
  "playerfemale_30308": "[[Here they are.]] Happy to help. Here you go.",
  "playerfemale_30309": "[[All yours! – for a fee.]] Getting them was more work than I expected. I'd like to be paid for my time.",
  "playerfemale_30320": "Hello. Can you point me in the direction of the rubbish?",
  "playerfemale_30321": "Who knew all of this was going on right beneath our feet?",
  "playerfemale_30322": "I've gained a new appreciation for breakfast.",
  "playerfemale_30323": "There's nothing like a meal prepared by a house-elf.",
  "playerfemale_30324": "It smells glorious in here.",
  "playerfemale_30325": "Hmm. Here's some beef, but it's not rotten. I'd best keep looking.",
  "playerfemale_30326": "Here's a welcome treat. Delicious.",
  "playerfemale_30327": "Pardon me, but can you point me to the rubbish?",
  "playerfemale_30328": "Oof. There's a disgusting smell. I must be getting close.",
  "playerfemale_30332": "[[Can't someone buy them for you?]] Couldn't you have someone buy the dried Billywig stings?",
  "playerfemale_30333": "[[Isn't this stealing?]] Are you asking me to steal from a shop?",
  "playerfemale_30336": "Another note?",
  "playerfemale_30337": "I need to get that note down.",
  "playerfemale_30338": "I need to retrieve that note.",
  "playerfemale_30339": "I don't think I can get to that note – I'll have to bring it to me.",
  "playerfemale_30340": "Ah – the bells must be upstairs.",
  "playerfemale_30341": "One up, one to go.",
  "playerfemale_30342": "I'll have to get those up there somehow – <i>Wingardium Leviosa</i>, perhaps?",
  "playerfemale_30343": "Well, that wasn't too hard. Evangeline should be pleased about this – even if Black isn't.",
  "playerfemale_30346": "[[How will this benefit me?]] I suppose I could. But why should I spend my time on a glorified errand?",
  "playerfemale_30351": "The statues Mr Ollivander mentioned must be upstairs amongst the owls.",
  "playerfemale_30352": "Don't mind me, owls. I'm here to help a friend. Now, where are those statues?",
  "playerfemale_30355": "Empty perches. Could be the right size for jackdaws. Or, statues of jackdaws.",
  "playerfemale_30360": "That's it.",
  "playerfemale_30365": "Not my best.",
  "playerfemale_30374": "You wanted to see me, sir?",
  "playerfemale_30375": "[[Justice must be served.]] I'll do whatever I can.",
  "playerfemale_30377": "[[Murder? Sounds intriguing.]] This could be right up my street. Even we Hufflepuffs enjoy a good mystery.",
  "playerfemale_30379": "How do you know about the book – and the pages?",
  "playerfemale_30385": "Madam Thistlewood? I met your great-uncle in his portrait in my common room. He sent me to speak to you.",
  "playerfemale_30390": "Sir? Why do I need to complete these tasks again?",
  "playerfemale_30394": "Perhaps Sir Affpuddle is upstairs.",
  "playerfemale_30396": "[[That's a shame.]] Pity goblins and wizards can't get along.",
  "playerfemale_30397": "[[I'm not surprised.]] Goblins and wizardkind will never trust each other.",
  "playerfemale_30405": "[[Thank you.]] Thank you. I need to find those pages – to help a friend.",
  "playerfemale_30411": "Let's play Summoner's Court.",
  "playerfemale_30413": "Aha. There's bound to be something up there.",
  "playerfemale_30418": "[[Sounds intriguing.]] Of course, Mr Ollivander. Sounds most up my street.",
  "playerfemale_30419": "[[Happy to undermine authority if it benefits me.]] Undermining the Headmaster and getting something in return? – Continue.",
  "playerfemale_30424": "[[Do you conjure the food here?]] Do you and the other house-elves conjure the food served in the Great Hall?",
  "playerfemale_30429": "Is everything all right?",
  "playerfemale_30430": "I take it you're Alexandra's 'friend'.",
  "playerfemale_30431": "It's done, Alexandra. I – took care of him.",
  "playerfemale_30432": "I feel awful for Alexandra. But the hamlet needed to be saved from that troll.",
  "playerfemale_30433": "Yes. Very nice.",
  "playerfemale_30434": "That's how you do it.",
  "playerfemale_30435": "Excellent.",
  "playerfemale_30436": "There we go.",
  "playerfemale_30438": "Not quite.",
  "playerfemale_30442": "Well, that wasn't ideal.",
  "playerfemale_30455": "Pardon me, is everything all right?",
  "playerfemale_30460": "[[No need to be upset.]] Come now, Leander. There's no need for that.",
  "playerfemale_30461": "[[That wasn't luck.]] I'm not lucky, I'm simply better than you.",
  "playerfemale_30462": "Samantha, about Summoner's Court –",
  "playerfemale_30463": "Hello, Grace. Let's play Summoner's Court.",
  "playerfemale_30464": "Hello Charlotte. Let's play Summoner's Court.",
  "playerfemale_30465": "Professor, I'd like to play a game of Summoner's Court.",
  "playerfemale_30470": "An encampment. This must be it.",
  "playerfemale_30471": "Arn, I have good news. Your carts are on their way back.",
  "playerfemale_30472": "That was quite something.",
  "playerfemale_30474": "Hello, Lucan. Is the next round of Crossed Wands all set?",
  "playerfemale_30475": "[[Ready for another round.]] I'm ready. Let's do it.",
  "playerfemale_30476": "[[Not right now.]] Not at the moment.",
  "playerfemale_30478": "Hello, Lucan. Is the final round of Crossed Wands ready?",
  "playerfemale_30482": "Hello, Lucan. Is the final round of Crossed Wands ready?",
  "playerfemale_30483": "[[Absolutely.]] I certainly am.",
  "playerfemale_30484": "[[Not now.]] I'm not quite ready yet.",
  "playerfemale_30485": "[[Very well.]] Yes, I'm ready now.",
  "playerfemale_30486": "[[Not right now.]] No, I don't think so. Not right now.",
  "playerfemale_30493": "[[It's an honour.]] I'm just pleased to have done as well as I did.",
  "playerfemale_30494": "[[I got lucky.]] It was mostly luck, that's all.",
  "playerfemale_30495": "[[I'm just getting started.]] That was nothing. I'm just getting started.",
  "playerfemale_30500": "He did. We were talking about Hogwarts founders and he mentioned it. Wouldn't say much more, though.",
  "playerfemale_30502": "He did. We were talking about our house founder and he mentioned it. Wouldn't say much more, though.",
  "playerfemale_30505": "Could this be Mr Oakes's campsite?",
  "playerfemale_30506": "Hello? Mr Oakes?",
  "playerfemale_30507": "[[Tell me about the ring.]] Tell me more about this treasured ring.",
  "playerfemale_30508": "Down to the water's edge. Hmm. This had better not be a trick.",
  "playerfemale_30509": "A lift. Must be how I get down. Looks broken though –",
  "playerfemale_30510": "I'm trapped. How am I supposed to get out of here?",
  "playerfemale_30511": "This – looks a bit dangerous.",
  "playerfemale_30516": "What do you mean your own troll?",
  "playerfemale_30519": "Concerning your troll –",
  "playerfemale_30520": "[[Who's Barnabas the Barmy?]] Who's Barnabas the Barmy?",
  "playerfemale_30521": "[[What were you training the troll to do?]] What exactly were you training the troll to do?",
  "playerfemale_30523": "[[Keep practising.]] Chin up, Leander. Keep practising, and you'll get better.",
  "playerfemale_30525": "[[You're clearly not cut out for this.]] Leander, there's no easy way to say this – well, actually there is. You're not cut out for it.",
  "playerfemale_30526": "[[Thank you.]] Thank you. It's been an honour.",
  "playerfemale_30528": "[[I don't know that I deserve this.]] I'm flattered, but I don't deserve such an honour.",
  "playerfemale_30532": "[[I'll see what I can learn.]] I'll try and look into it for you, Adelaide.",
  "playerfemale_30534": "Yes sir.",
  "playerfemale_30535": "Arn. About your carts –",
  "playerfemale_30536": "It's all right; there we go.",
  "playerfemale_30537": "Well, that didn't work. Perhaps something with a bit more force.",
  "playerfemale_30538": "Dead end. Must be another way in.",
  "playerfemale_30539": "That looks as if it might raise the gate.",
  "playerfemale_30540": "I hope Natty stays out of trouble.",
  "playerfemale_30541": "Not the safest place to sneak into.",
  "playerfemale_30542": "So much for my efforts at concealment.",
  "playerfemale_30543": "I hope Natty's having an easier time of it.",
  "playerfemale_30544": "Oh no! Deek was right. We need to save you from these barbarians.",
  "playerfemale_30547": "Yes. She used to be an Auror. Well, she took me to Azkaban to meet Anne Thisbe –",
  "playerfemale_30548": "– and so I went to the Owlery, like he said. And there were all these statues.",
  "playerfemale_30549": "Yes. I thought it was odd too. He asked me to meet him and then told me to take the toast –",
  "playerfemale_30555": "[[Not right now.]] Perhaps later. I have other things to do.",
  "playerfemale_30556": "Quite an experience. But, you see, Anne knew Richard Jackdaw before he died. So I had to find his ghost.",
  "playerfemale_30557": "Yes. Which led me to a secret hideout where I found Richard Jackdaw's ghost –",
  "playerfemale_30558": "– to a cave under the lake. That's where I found Richard Jackdaw's ghost.",
  "playerfemale_30559": "Yes. I thought it was odd too. But then we took the roast beef to Sir Podmore of the Headless Hunt and –",
  "playerfemale_30560": "That did it.",
  "playerfemale_30561": "Why me?",
  "playerfemale_30567": "I know just the spell to repair this armour.",
  "playerfemale_30568": "That wasn't so difficult after all. Now, to find that book.",
  "playerfemale_30569": "Conjuring?",
  "playerfemale_30574": "[[You did what you could.]] There wasn't much you could've done. He was beyond training. Tried to kill me the entire time.",
  "playerfemale_30575": "Hello, Lodgok. Sirona said I might find you here.",
  "playerfemale_30577": "Hello, Garreth. What exactly did you want me to do again?",
  "playerfemale_30578": "I suppose you could call it 'eventful.' I certainly wasn't expecting a troll attack.",
  "playerfemale_30585": "Now that’s more like it.",
  "playerfemale_30587": "What a view.",
  "playerfemale_30588": "Ah!",
  "playerfemale_30591": "Hello. Nice to meet you.",
  "playerfemale_30592": "Nice to see you again.",
  "playerfemale_30593": "[[May I ask about your shop and this hamlet?]] I'd like to ask you a few things, if you don't mind.",
  "playerfemale_30594": "[[I'm just looking.]] Just having a look around, if that's all right.",
  "playerfemale_30595": "[[What can you tell me about this hamlet?]] Would you mind telling me a little about Keenbridge?",
  "playerfemale_30596": "[[What is your background?]] How did you come to live here in Keenbridge?",
  "playerfemale_30597": "[[What can you tell me about this shop?]] What sorts of things do you sell?",
  "playerfemale_30602": "[[I shall keep an eye out.]] I'm sorry this happened to you. I shall certainly keep an eye out for your carts.",
  "playerfemale_30609": "A Demiguise?",
  "playerfemale_30613": "[[I'd be happy to help.]] I'd be glad to help you, Mr Moon.",
  "playerfemale_30614": "[[I don't want to get in trouble.]] The Faculty Tower? I'm not sure I should be going in there.",
  "playerfemale_30615": "[[What's in it for me?]] Why would I do this? Seems all risk and no reward.",
  "playerfemale_30616": "Hmm. I wonder what that does.",
  "playerfemale_30617": "That wasn't too bad.",
  "playerfemale_30618": "Ha! Good, I've got this!",
  "playerfemale_30621": "Brilliant. Count me in.",
  "playerfemale_30624": "[[Yes, I would.]] Yes. Don't count me out yet.",
  "playerfemale_30625": "[[No, thank you.]] Perhaps later.",
  "playerfemale_30627": "[[It is a bit ludicrous.]] I'm inclined to agree with them. Trolls are dangerous creatures.",
  "playerfemale_30628": "[[It's brave of you to try.]] It certainly takes a lot of courage to try, I'll give you that.",
  "playerfemale_30629": "[[What's a spellcraft?]] I've never heard of a spellcraft before Professor. What is it?",
  "playerfemale_30631": "You call that duelling?",
  "playerfemale_30632": "Don't take it so badly.",
  "playerfemale_30633": "Come on, then!",
  "playerfemale_30634": "Care to try me?",
  "playerfemale_30635": "This is starting to hurt.",
  "playerfemale_30636": "Perhaps a potion would help.",
  "playerfemale_30637": "This isn't going well.",
  "playerfemale_30638": "What potions do I have?",
  "playerfemale_30641": "[[Remind me, why can't you remove the statues yourself?]] Why can't you get the Demiguise moons yourself?",
  "playerfemale_30642": "[[Who do you suspect planted the statues?]] Do you know who is behind the Demiguise statues?",
  "playerfemale_30647": "[[I've rescued one already.]] Actually, I've already rescued one.",
  "playerfemale_30648": "[[Of course. What can I do for you?]] Happy to help – especially if you can shed light on the book.",
  "playerfemale_30649": "[[I'd rather not risk trouble with Black.]] I'm not so sure about this. I don't need the Headmaster upset with me.",
  "playerfemale_30650": "What's this all about? Your notes mentioned the book I found in the Restricted Section.",
  "playerfemale_30651": "I'm sorry to hear that. But – how do you benefit if I find the pages?",
  "playerfemale_30654": "[[How did you know about the book I found?]] How did you know that I'd found a book and that it's missing pages?",
  "playerfemale_30655": "[[I'm not sure I'm up to the task.]] I don't know, Mr Ollivander. Perhaps Professor Fig overestimates my abilities.",
  "playerfemale_30656": "Richard Jackdaw?",
  "playerfemale_30657": "[[Why don't you continue searching the Owlery?]] Surely you could continue searching the Owlery.",
  "playerfemale_30659": "[[How did you lose your head?]] I think I can guess how you died – but who did it to you?",
  "playerfemale_30665": "[[I shall head there directly.]] I shall go and see her right away.",
  "playerfemale_30666": "That sounds terrible – but I'm not sure how I can help.",
  "playerfemale_30667": "[[I'll come with you to Azkaban if it will save her.]] What a horrible story. If you think I can help, I'll come with you.",
  "playerfemale_30668": "[[I'm not sure I want to visit Azkaban.]] I'd rather not go to Azkaban. Is there no other way to help?",
  "playerfemale_30669": "[[Anything to see Azkaban.]] I've always wanted to see Azkaban. Count me in.",
  "playerfemale_30670": "A jackdaw. Just as Mr Ollivander said. Seen better days, I fear.",
  "playerfemale_30671": "I recognise those handles. The Summoning Charm should do the trick.",
  "playerfemale_30672": "Birds aren't afraid of heights. Perhaps I should look a bit higher.",
  "playerfemale_30673": "Deek?",
  "playerfemale_30674": "I'm a student. From Hogwarts.",
  "playerfemale_30675": "[[I think I understand.]] Are you saying that the missing pages are in a cave? Near Upper Hogsfield?",
  "playerfemale_30676": "[[Why must you be so cryptic?]] What are you trying to say? That the missing pages are in a cave? Near Upper Hogsfield?",
  "playerfemale_30677": "A vault. In some ruins. Near Upper Hogsfield? I suppose it can't hurt to look.",
  "playerfemale_30678": "But, Madam Thistlewood! I – all right. I'll find it. I'll find Jackdaw's cave.",
  "playerfemale_30679": "Very well. I'm listening.",
  "playerfemale_30680": "[[I'm ready to go.]] Very well. Let's go.",
  "playerfemale_30681": "This must be the place Anne told me about.",
  "playerfemale_30687": "[[I'll retrieve the relic.]] Very well, I'll retrieve the relic if you promise to share Ranrok's plans with me.",
  "playerfemale_30689": "[[This sounds like a trap.]] If I retrieve the relic, how do I know you'll tell me the truth about what Ranrok says?",
  "playerfemale_30693": "There they are. The Ashwinders.",
  "playerfemale_30694": "A retired Auror, Helen Thistlewood, told me about a map you stole from Peeves. And then Anne told me about a cave.",
  "playerfemale_30695": "[[Not well, I'm afraid.]] She was imprisoned in Azkaban for your murder. I fear the Dementors have taken an irreversible toll on her.",
  "playerfemale_30696": "[[You ruined her life.]] She was imprisoned in Azkaban for your murder. Why didn't you exonerate her?",
  "playerfemale_30697": "I'm glad to hear it. Before you go, would I still be able to find the pages with the map Helen mentioned?",
  "playerfemale_30704": "I gave it my all.",
  "playerfemale_30706": "[[Yes, I would.]] I'll give it another go.",
  "playerfemale_30707": "[[No, thank you.]] I think I'd better rest for a bit.",
  "playerfemale_30708": "Nice to meet you, Ominis.",
  "playerfemale_30710": "Hello again, Mr Moon.",
  "playerfemale_30713": "I hear them.",
  "playerfemale_30715": "Pardon? Were you calling to me?",
  "playerfemale_30718": "Miss Moffett, I caught Gwyneira.",
  "playerfemale_30719": "Pardon me sir, I'm here for the spellcrafts Professor Weasley ordered.",
  "playerfemale_30720": "I'm afraid I haven't yet, sir.",
  "playerfemale_30721": "That's certainly something to aspire to, Mr Brown. I look forward to that day.",
  "playerfemale_30723": "Hello, Miss Coffey. How are you?",
  "playerfemale_30724": "[[I'm sorry to hear that.]] I'm sorry to hear that your pet is missing.",
  "playerfemale_30725": "[[It's just a Niffler.]] I shouldn't worry about it. It's only a Niffler.",
  "playerfemale_30726": "[[I'll try and find your Niffler.]] I'll keep an eye out for Rococo.",
  "playerfemale_30729": "What did you need me to help you with, Miss Coffey?",
  "playerfemale_30733": "[[Tell me more about Henrietta.]] Why did Henrietta feel the need to protect her house like she did?",
  "playerfemale_30735": "[[Why don't you get him yourself?]] Why don't you just get Rococo back yourself?",
  "playerfemale_30736": "Wait. How do you know about the book? And that it's missing pages?",
  "playerfemale_30737": "Nice to meet you, Sir Nicholas.",
  "playerfemale_30738": "Sir Nicholas? You were looking for me?",
  "playerfemale_30739": "[[Thank you. I should be going.]] It was nice to meet you. Thank you for the beef.",
  "playerfemale_30740": "This is all rather cryptic, Sir Nicholas. What's going on?",
  "playerfemale_30743": "Made it. Did anyone else see that?",
  "playerfemale_30744": "This is rather fun.",
  "playerfemale_30745": "Brilliant.",
  "playerfemale_30753": "'Headless activities'?",
  "playerfemale_30754": "[[Very well. Sounds intriguing.]] Very well. I'd like to meet Sir Patrick myself – and see this 'Headless Hunt.'",
  "playerfemale_30757": "[[The roast beef wasn't for you?]] I thought the rotten roast beef was for you.",
  "playerfemale_30759": "Pardon me sir, I'm here for the seeds Professor Weasley arranged for me to collect.",
  "playerfemale_30761": "Miss Coffey, I found your Niffler!",
  "playerfemale_30762": "[[Of course.]] I'm sure he'll be happy to go home.",
  "playerfemale_30767": "More treasure. Rococo must have been through here.",
  "playerfemale_30768": "Treasure. That Niffler's certainly leaving quite a trail.",
  "playerfemale_30769": "These coins must have come from Miss Coffey's Niffler.",
  "playerfemale_30770": "I should follow the treasure to find that Niffler.",
  "playerfemale_30771": "There it is, just as Jackdaw described.",
  "playerfemale_30773": "I wonder how big this place is.",
  "playerfemale_30775": "These runes must have something to do with opening this door.",
  "playerfemale_30776": "Locked. Damn.",
  "playerfemale_30777": "I think I see. I'll need to cast more quickly.",
  "playerfemale_30778": "I need to hurry things up. The runes have reset.",
  "playerfemale_30779": "The runes go dark if I wait too long.",
  "playerfemale_30780": "I suppose I should do this a bit quicker.",
  "playerfemale_30781": "It appears that one glowing rune alone is not going to solve this puzzle.",
  "playerfemale_30782": "I think I'll need to light all of these.",
  "playerfemale_30783": "That one's gone dark. This will take more than one.",
  "playerfemale_30784": "That didn't stay glowing for long, and the door didn't open. Hmm.",
  "playerfemale_30785": "Impressive. That must be where this all leads.",
  "playerfemale_30786": "Someone didn't want casual visitors down here.",
  "playerfemale_30787": "I wonder if any of my spells will help me through this.",
  "playerfemale_30789": "That's odd, I'd have thought Jackdaw would have been interested in this loot, but there's no sign of him.",
  "playerfemale_30790": "I'd say the Summoning Charm would come in handy right about now.",
  "playerfemale_30791": "I wonder if I can move that platform somehow.",
  "playerfemale_30793": "That platform ought to be able to float straight to me.",
  "playerfemale_30794": "If I could summon that platform to me, I could likely get on it.",
  "playerfemale_30795": "Another puzzle. Well, if Jackdaw could solve this, so can I.",
  "playerfemale_30796": "There must be another rune somewhere around here.",
  "playerfemale_30798": "Not at all. I need to speak to Richard Jackdaw. Sir Patrick said his head might be around here somewhere.",
  "playerfemale_30799": "[[I'll rescue a Mooncalf.]] I shall go and find a Mooncalf then.",
  "playerfemale_30803": "We meet again, Richard Jackdaw. Shame. Those splinters must be what's left of Ollivander's wand. At least I can take the pages.",
  "playerfemale_30804": "Oh no. The room's starting to – flood?",
  "playerfemale_30806": "It's a good thing Jackdaw didn't fall down there.",
  "playerfemale_30807": "I'm not going to touch those. Eww.",
  "playerfemale_30808": "More spiders? These can't be what beheaded Richard Jackdaw.",
  "playerfemale_30811": "Farewell, monster. I can only imagine how these spiders have multiplied since Jackdaw came this way.",
  "playerfemale_30812": "There it is! The bridge. It's almost complete.",
  "playerfemale_30813": "I must be getting closer to Jackdaw's remains – and those pages.",
  "playerfemale_30814": "There's Jackdaw, looking dead as ever. What happened here? Might it happen again?",
  "playerfemale_30815": "May as well have a look around before I collect the pages.",
  "playerfemale_30816": "I should collect what I came for and be on my way.",
  "playerfemale_30817": "Wh – that's unnerving. What's happening?",
  "playerfemale_30818": "I've seen this before – in Gringotts and the Restricted Section.",
  "playerfemale_30819": "That must be the way out of here.",
  "playerfemale_30821": "I can only hope this magic protects me until I'm able to make my way out of here.",
  "playerfemale_30822": "Where am I?",
  "playerfemale_30826": "I'm – back at Hogwarts?",
  "playerfemale_30827": "Professor Weasley sent me to collect some recipes. I'm new at Hogwarts.",
  "playerfemale_30828": "Pardon me, sir –",
  "playerfemale_30830": "[[I have no regrets.]] It was worth losing a few house points for that detour.",
  "playerfemale_30831": "[[I wish we hadn't got in trouble.]] Perhaps. But we did get in trouble and Kogawa could hold it against us.",
  "playerfemale_30837": "I suppose not.",
  "playerfemale_30846": "Is someone down there?",
  "playerfemale_30848": "Seems to be some sort of map.",
  "playerfemale_30850": "[[Do you know why Ranrok is working with Rookwood?]] It seems Ranrok and Rookwood are conspiring. Why would that be?",
  "playerfemale_30851": "I retrieved the helmet from the Ashwinders.",
  "playerfemale_30857": "Enchanted candles? Wonder where they're heading?",
  "playerfemale_30858": "I suppose a picnic in the Forbidden Forest could seem romantic to some.",

  "playerfemale_30866": "[[Whisperer?]] Whisperer?",
  "playerfemale_30867": "Hello.",
  "playerfemale_30871": "[[Are you saying someone died here?]] Someone died here?",
  "playerfemale_30875": "[[I'm ready.]] It all seems clear to me now that we're here.",
  "playerfemale_30880": "That's good news. He seems very nice.",
  "playerfemale_30885": "Hello. Is something the matter?",
  "playerfemale_30887": "[[I'll keep an eye out.]] I'll keep an eye out for your Mooncalf, Garnuff.",

  "playerfemale_30899": "Excuse me, Madam? I thought I heard you say something.",
  "playerfemale_30900": "[[I do enjoy a good puzzle.]] An archaic puzzle? Sounds fascinating.",
  "playerfemale_30901": "[[I'm not a fan of puzzles.]] I'm afraid I don't find puzzles that engaging.",
  "playerfemale_30902": "[[I'll see what I can do.]] If I happen to see it, I'll have a look.",
  "playerfemale_30903": "Can you tell me again about the puzzle that you found?",
  "playerfemale_30904": "Mrs Twiddle? Your husband was right. The statue was part of a puzzle.",
  "playerfemale_30905": "Hello.",
  "playerfemale_30908": "[[Sounds frustrating.]] I can imagine that would be rather frustrating.",
  "playerfemale_30909": "[[Not an ideal choice of merchandise.]] Seems like a poor choice of inventory. Surely that's obvious?",
  "playerfemale_30910": "Sounds like stocking your shelves comes with some hazards.",
  "playerfemale_30911": "Perhaps it was your dealings with Fwoopers that led to the precarious idea of stocking Diricawls.",
  "playerfemale_30912": "Thank you, I will.",
  "playerfemale_30917": "You said you know what to do?",
  "playerfemale_30919": "Thank you for the warning.",
  "playerfemale_30920": "[[How did you lose your head?]] If you don't mind my asking, how did you lose your head?",
  "playerfemale_30921": "[[Is this all Apollonia's fault?]] Helen mentioned Apollonia Black. Did she set up Anne to take the fall?",
  "playerfemale_30923": "You sound as if you could use some help.",
  "playerfemale_30927": "[[Yes.]] I have them right here.",
  "playerfemale_30928": "Hello, Mr Ndiaye. Eddie Thistlewood sent me.",
  "playerfemale_30929": "[[No.]] Not yet, I'm afraid.",
  "playerfemale_30930": "[[Why are the goblins targeting Feldcroft?]] Do you have any idea why the goblins are attacking Feldcroft?",

  "playerfemale_30933": "Hello, again, Mr Ndiaye.",
  "playerfemale_30934": "[[For a fee.]] It wasn't easy battling Ashwinders and finding a Niffler in that house. I've earned a reward.",
  "playerfemale_30952": "Sir? Is everything all right?",
  "playerfemale_30954": "[[I'll do it.]] I'll get the Venomous Tentacula for you.",
  "playerfemale_30955": "[[I'm not comfortable with this.]] I'm not sure this is something a student should be doing on your behalf.",
  "playerfemale_30957": "Mr Barnes, about that Venomous Tentacula you wanted me to get.",
  "playerfemale_30958": "Hello, Mr Barnes. I have that Venomous Tentacula.",
  "playerfemale_30959": "[[I'm keeping him.]] Actually, he's taken a liking to me. So I've decided to keep him.",
  "playerfemale_30963": "Hurry!",
  "playerfemale_30964": "All right. Where would I find one?",
  "playerfemale_30965": "Are there any other beasts nearby?",
  "playerfemale_30971": "I'm glad Richard Jackdaw left a little something behind for me. But where could he be?",
  "playerfemale_30972": "Not a headless skeleton in sight, but I may as well help myself to this.",
  "playerfemale_30973": "An untouched chest? Jackdaw wasn't very thorough in his search of this cave.",
  "playerfemale_30974": "There you go.",
  "playerfemale_30975": "Good Kneazle.",
  "playerfemale_30976": "No, I'm not. Sir Nicholas said you might know the location of some pages I'm looking for.",
  "playerfemale_30980": "Ominis, I hadn't imagined we'd end up trapped like this.",
  "playerfemale_30983": "We meet again, Richard Jackdaw. Thank you for keeping these pages safe all these years.",
  "playerfemale_30987": "Hello, can I help you?",
  "playerfemale_30988": "[[An underwater adventure sounds like fun.]] Diving into the lake sounds like an adventure. Tell me more.",
  "playerfemale_30989": "[[Diving into the lake doesn't sound too appealing.]] I'm afraid I'm not keen on mucking about at the bottom of lakes.",
  "playerfemale_30992": "[[I'll have to think about this.]] It sounds dangerous. Especially for something of mere sentimental value.",
  "playerfemale_30995": "[[Should I know who your family are?]] You seemed to think I might've heard of the 'Bath Pinch-Smedleys.' Why would I know of your family?",
  "playerfemale_30999": "Grace, what is it you needed my help with?",
  "playerfemale_31001": "Hello, Grace. I followed your bearings on a dive in the Black Lake.",
  "playerfemale_31002": "[[I did – here you are.]] I did. I hope it makes your father happy.",
  "playerfemale_31003": "[[I did. And it's yours – for a price.]] I did. But it wasn't easy. I shall need to be compensated.",
  "playerfemale_31005": "That's really not funny.",
  "playerfemale_31013": "[[What is an astrolabe?]] What exactly is an astrolabe?",
  "playerfemale_31022": "[[Of course, Professor.]] I will, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_31023": "[[Is this an appropriate spell for students?]] Is this something we should be learning in school?",
  "playerfemale_31036": "I'll be fine, Mr Oakes. You get back to Adelaide. I assure you, her worries outweigh yours.",
  "playerfemale_31040": "I found the pages and the Map Chamber. Why would I need the book?",
  "playerfemale_31057": "'Golden Gobstones'?",
  "playerfemale_31058": "Can't say I recommend it, frankly. It's nice to meet you, Amit. I take it you like Astronomy?",
  "playerfemale_31064": "No one at school's going to believe this.",
  "playerfemale_31078": "Hello Deek. Professor Weasley said you had an idea.",
  "playerfemale_31079": "What's this?",
  "playerfemale_31080": "Oh!",
  "playerfemale_31081": "What was that?",
  "playerfemale_31082": "Was that a Golden Snitch?",
  "playerfemale_31093": "[[I find the stars fascinating.]] I hope Astronomy's on my schedule. It sounds interesting.",
  "playerfemale_31094": "[[I've never been one for star-gazing.]] I'm afraid I'm not much for memorising constellations. Enough to worry about on the ground.",
  "playerfemale_31099": "Nice to meet you, Samantha. Is dittany used in Wiggenweld Potion?",
  "playerfemale_31105": "[[Isn't it Hufflepuffs who like plants?]] An affinity for Herbology is more typical of a Hufflepuff than a Ravenclaw, isn't it?",
  "playerfemale_31136": "Hello.",
  "playerfemale_31137": "[[A change? Why not!]] Why not, I say. What sort of change?",
  "playerfemale_31138": "[[Er, I don't think so.]] I'm not sure what you mean, but I'm quite all right as I am.",
  "playerfemale_31142": "Is that your owl?",
  "playerfemale_31143": "Enjoying the view?",
  "playerfemale_31144": "[[What do you mean?]] Are you saying some spells aren't taught at Hogwarts? Which ones?",
  "playerfemale_31146": "[[I do have a lot to catch up on.]] I am a bit concerned. I have a lot of catching up to do.",
  "playerfemale_31147": "[[I'm not worried.]] I'm really not worried. I'm sure I'll be fine.",
  "playerfemale_31157": "These vines are as dry as kindling.",
  "playerfemale_31158": "[[Of course.]] It looks like a Graphorn.",
  "playerfemale_31159": "[[I'm not certain.]] That's a head? I can't say that I do.",
  "playerfemale_31160": "[[I’m ready.]] If that's what must be done, I'll do it.",
  "playerfemale_31163": "[[I have to subdue a Graphorn?]] Have you ever subdued a Graphorn, Professor?",
  "playerfemale_31167": "Very well, Lord of the Shore, show yourself.",
  "playerfemale_31168": "This must be the place.",
  "playerfemale_31169": "The Graphorn is somehow the key to opening the room.",
  "playerfemale_31180": "There it is again!",
  "playerfemale_31181": "That was for Highwing.",
  "playerfemale_31182": "[[Let's find our dragon then.]] Well, then. Let's find our dragon and return her egg.",
  "playerfemale_31184": "Can't we Apparate past them into the tower?",
  "playerfemale_31186": "It's more than mere coincidence that we encountered Ranrok's Loyalists here.",
  "playerfemale_31187": "Can't imagine the goblins know about the trials. They know that something is significant about this place, though.",
  "playerfemale_31203": "I presume I'm looking for traces of ancient magic. But where?",
  "playerfemale_31215": "[[I'd rather not.]] I don't want to fly right now. Perhaps later.",
  "playerfemale_31216": "[[I did. And I'm keeping it.]] I did find it. However, I've taken a liking to it so I'm going to keep it.",
  "playerfemale_31217": "I'm sorry – how exactly has he been cursed?",
  "playerfemale_31220": "Well, it is an unusual situation. How did your brother end up like this?",
  "playerfemale_31221": "[[Nice to meet you.]] It was nice meeting you, Lenora.",
  "playerfemale_31222": "[[Good luck, Arthur.]] Nice meeting you, Arthur. And good luck finding that cat.",
  "playerfemale_31223": "Nice to meet you too. Is everything all right?",
  "playerfemale_31228": "[[I nearly went deaf.]] I'll say. I nearly went deaf.",
  "playerfemale_31232": "Wait here. I'll run ahead to the next safe spot.",
  "playerfemale_31233": "[[Yes, I was.]] That one is true. Not the typical start to a new school.",
  "playerfemale_31234": "[[I'd rather not talk about it.]] If you don't mind, I'd prefer to just forget about it.",
  "playerfemale_31236": "[[Nice meeting you.]] Thank you, Adelaide. Be seeing you.",
  "playerfemale_31237": "What do you need help retrieving?",
  "playerfemale_31238": "Perhaps. What precisely do you need to retrieve and why?",
  "playerfemale_31239": "I'm so sorry. What happened to them?",
  "playerfemale_31240": "Finders keepers, Grace.",
  "playerfemale_31241": "[[As am I. Plants offer so much.]] Magical plants have so much to offer. I'm eager to learn more.",
  "playerfemale_31245": "[[Is your uncle all right?]] Are you sure everything is all right with your uncle?",
  "playerfemale_31254": "I already have some, Professor. Picked them up in Hogsmeade.",
  "playerfemale_31255": "Yes, Professor?",
  "playerfemale_31264": "[[You think you should've been a Ravenclaw?]] Do you really think you should have been in Ravenclaw?",
  "playerfemale_31276": "Remarkable.",
  "playerfemale_31279": "[[Have you ever had a pet?]] Have you ever had a pet, Arthur?",
  "playerfemale_31280": "Seems I need to find Mr Lawley's cellar.",
  "playerfemale_31281": "This must be it.",
  "playerfemale_31282": "Better not let Mr Lawley see me.",
  "playerfemale_31283": "Where is that Venomous Tentacula?",
  "playerfemale_31284": "So many spiders. It's a wonder they haven't taken over the whole house. ",
  "playerfemale_31285": "Now that I have the Venomous Tentacula, I should return to Mr Barnes.",
  "playerfemale_31287": "Perhaps one of these guards has the key.",
  "playerfemale_31288": "Could the phoenix be in there?",
  "playerfemale_31290": "Can I help you?",
  "playerfemale_31296": "[[I'll see what I can do.]] If you tell me where to go, I'll see what I can do about it.",
  "playerfemale_31298": "Sophronia, I solved all the puzzles in the Hall of Herodiana.",
  "playerfemale_31299": "[[Yes.]] Of course. Behold!",
  "playerfemale_31300": "[[Yes, for a fee.]] Of course, but not for free. That wasn't easy.",
  "playerfemale_31301": "[[No. You should have found it yourself.]] You were right about how spectacular it is. Which is why it's a pity you didn't find it yourself.",
  "playerfemale_31302": "This must be the entrance to the 'Hall of Herodiana.'",
  "playerfemale_31303": "Well, here it is: the Hall of Herodiana. Better go inside and find those puzzles.",
  "playerfemale_31309": "And this must be the last piece of Herodiana's ensemble. It is remarkable.",
  "playerfemale_31310": "That wasn't too hard. I wonder what's next.",
  "playerfemale_31311": "I think I'm getting the hang of this now. Just one left.",
  "playerfemale_31312": "Suppose I should look for that secret hall Sophronia told me about. It does sound interesting.",
  "playerfemale_31322": "Fig is an interesting wizard, to be sure. I imagine he could tell some stories.",
  "playerfemale_31330": "Hello again, Mr Thistlewood.",
  "playerfemale_31331": "[[Is Brocburrow safe?]] Do you stay close to home because it's safe in the hamlet?",
  "playerfemale_31332": "[[Don't you want to see the world?]] You never wanted to get out and explore the world around you?",
  "playerfemale_31338": "Hello.",
  "playerfemale_31339": "Helen Thistlewood, wasn't it?",
  "playerfemale_31340": "You sound like someone who's seen their share of the outside world.",
  "playerfemale_31341": "[[You were an Auror?]] What was it like being an Auror?",
  "playerfemale_31342": "[[Tell me about the Dark Arts.]] You must have some experience battling evil forces in the world.",
  "playerfemale_31345": "[[I just wanted to say hello.]] Just saying hello. It was nice to meet you.",
  "playerfemale_31346": "Sacharissa, I found the Bubotubers you needed.",
  "playerfemale_31347": "This is where Sacharissa said to go. Now where are those Bubotubers?",
  "playerfemale_31348": "That should do it. I'd better get back to Sacharissa now.",
  "playerfemale_31349": "This must be where the Pinch-Smedley family astrolabe is.",
  "playerfemale_31350": "I should let Grace know that I've found her family astrolabe.",
  "playerfemale_31351": "[[Of course.]] Of course. Happy to have found them for you.",
  "playerfemale_31352": "[[Yes, but for a higher price.]] It actually was a 'spot' of trouble. You never mentioned I might encounter a troll. I think you should pay me more.",
  "playerfemale_31356": "I'm ready to learn how to use the nab-sack.",
  "playerfemale_31369": "[[I'm sorry to hear that.]] Oh dear, that sounds awful.",
  "playerfemale_31370": "[[I'm not sure that's true.]] Did that really happen, or are you simply being overdramatic?",
  "playerfemale_31371": "[[What do you do for the Headmaster?]] What do you mean you do 'important work' for the Headmaster?",
  "playerfemale_31372": "Ferdinand Pratt thinks you should be. Says you 'stole his frame'.",
  "playerfemale_31373": "May I ask where you put him?",
  "playerfemale_31374": "[[Very well. Burning it is.]] You really oughtn't have said that.",
  "playerfemale_31375": "[[Returning you to the Three Broomsticks isn't my only option.]] What if I don't want to return you to the Three Broomsticks?",
  "playerfemale_31376": "[[I could burn you, but I won't.]] Tempting as a bonfire sounds, I think I'll spare you that fate.",
  "playerfemale_31377": "Goodbye, Ferdinand. Enjoy your new home.",
  "playerfemale_31378": "[[I know.]] It's no Three Broomsticks, that's for certain.",
  "playerfemale_31379": "[[It's not that bad.]] Oh, give it a chance. You might grow to like it.",
  "playerfemale_31383": "Oh, I see. Thank you anyway.",
  "playerfemale_31385": "Is everything all right, Madam – ?",
  "playerfemale_31386": "[[I might be able to help.]] I could take care of Selwyn for you.",
  "playerfemale_31389": "What did you need help with again?",
  "playerfemale_31390": "This must be the castle that Silvanus Selwyn and his thieves are in.",
  "playerfemale_31391": "If I can just get to him I should be able to disband the group.",
  "playerfemale_31393": "Selwyn has been taken care of.",
  "playerfemale_31394": "This must be the castle where Miss Coffey's Niffler ran away. Now to find a way inside.",
  "playerfemale_31395": "That's the end of them. Now I can focus on finding Rococo.",
  "playerfemale_31396": "This Niffler is a tricky one.",
  "playerfemale_31397": "Ugh. When I get my hands on that Niffler.",
  "playerfemale_31398": "I might as well grab the Niffler – I'm here now.",
  "playerfemale_31399": "Ashwinders!",
  "playerfemale_31400": "I hope Miss Coffey appreciates this.",
  "playerfemale_31401": "Never realised how tiring it can be to capture a Niffler.",
  "playerfemale_31402": "Best get back to Miss Coffey.",
  "playerfemale_31403": "What a dreadful lot.",
  "playerfemale_31404": "That 'hideaway' does sound intriguing. Perhaps I should investigate – for Rococo's sake.",
  "playerfemale_31405": "Ugh. More Ashwinders.",
  "playerfemale_31406": "I hope the Ashwinders haven't done anything with Rococo.",
  "playerfemale_31408": "[[Has this happened before?]] Has Ranrok's lot ever attacked you like this before?",
  "playerfemale_31412": "How many of you are there?",
  "playerfemale_31420": "Sebastian, look.",
  "playerfemale_31428": "Mr Weekes, what did you need from me?",
  "playerfemale_31429": "[[Can't wait to hear more. Goodbye.]] I'm excited to hear more.",
  "playerfemale_31432": "A time trial at the Quidditch pitch – sounds intriguing.",
  "playerfemale_31433": "I suspect Mr Weekes'll be glad to hear how I fared.",
  "playerfemale_31434": "I think this might be where I dive to reach the merpeople.",
  "playerfemale_31435": "Look at this place. Did the merpeople really leave Nerida an artefact?",
  "playerfemale_31436": "Now then. I'll need you to come with me.",
  "playerfemale_31437": "What do we have in here, then?",
  "playerfemale_31438": "Nerida will be happy about this.",
  "playerfemale_31439": "Now for the rest of you.",
  "playerfemale_31440": "Going for a swim?",
  "playerfemale_31441": "You're a liaison to the merpeople?",
  "playerfemale_31442": "[[I think what you're doing is admirable.]] I'm impressed. I think reaching out to the merpeople is a grand idea.",
  "playerfemale_31443": "[[I think you're wasting your time.]] I'm not sure this is a worthwhile endeavour. Do the merpeople even want to be 'liaised' with?",
  "playerfemale_31444": "[[Tell me about wizardkind's relationship with merpeople.]] How has wizardkind fallen short in its treatment of merpeople?",
  "playerfemale_31445": "[[What would a liaison to the merpeople do?]] What do you imagine a liaison to the merpeople would do?",
  "playerfemale_31446": "[[I can help you.]] Well, I can swim and could help you if you'd like.",
  "playerfemale_31450": "[[What's so interesting about merpeople?]] What is it about the merpeople that interests you so much?",
  "playerfemale_31451": "Your gift from the merpeople was exactly where they said it would be.",
  "playerfemale_31452": "[[Happy to have helped. Enjoy your gift.]] Then I'm glad we helped to foster some healthy diplomatic relations.",
  "playerfemale_31454": "[[I'll see what I can do.]] Very well, sir. I shall keep an eye out for two crates of Chinese Chomping Cabbages.",
  "playerfemale_31455": "Nice to meet you too, Madam Twiddle.",
  "playerfemale_31457": "[[Your whole training plan was doomed.]] Any plan you had to train that thing was doomed. He tried to kill me the entire time.",
  "playerfemale_31461": "[[I would like that.]] That sounds like a very good idea.",
  "playerfemale_31462": "[[Can't I simply rescue them?]] I don't know, Deek. Sounds a lot of work. Can't I just carry on rescuing beasts?",
  "playerfemale_31463": "I see. What do I need to do?",
  "playerfemale_31464": "[[Perhaps I can do it.]] I'm not thrilled at the prospect, but I'll consider it.",
  "playerfemale_31467": "[[It sounds a bit dangerous.]] Sounds a bit dangerous. I'd rather not risk running into poachers again.",
  "playerfemale_31468": "[[I'd better go and rescue it.]] Well, I'd better go and rescue it then, hadn't I?",
  "playerfemale_31470": "How is it that I can help you with your next broom upgrade?",
  "playerfemale_31471": "Off to the races, then.",
  "playerfemale_31472": "Another successful flight. I should let Mr Weekes know.",
  "playerfemale_31476": "Hmm. A map. It doesn't appear to be connected to the missing pages. Best hang onto it for now.",
  "playerfemale_31477": "Hmm. A map. I wonder where it leads?",
  "playerfemale_31478": "[[I've decided to keep the gift.]] I quite like the idea of an authentic, Mermish artefact. I'm tempted to keep it myself.",
  "playerfemale_31479": "[[I don't think you've earned it.]] If you really wanted this then perhaps you should have fetched it yourself.",
  "playerfemale_31480": "[[I'm teasing you. It's yours.]] I know, I know. I was only joking. It's all yours.",
  "playerfemale_31484": "The name makes sense now. And the secrecy.",
  "playerfemale_31486": "[[Why are the goblins attacking Feldcroft?]] Why would the goblins target Feldcroft?",
  "playerfemale_31487": "[[Couldn't you grow new cabbages?]] Could you not grow or buy more Chinese Chomping Cabbages?",
  "playerfemale_31489": "I need to deliver Chinese Chomping Cabbages to Bernard Ndiaye here in Feldcroft.",
  "playerfemale_31490": "I can see why Feldcroft needs help.",
  "playerfemale_31491": "Yes. I had to destroy a number of large vases, and that seemed to activate some sort of charm on the statue.",
  "playerfemale_31492": "I should look into the statue Madam Twiddle mentioned.",
  "playerfemale_31493": "This looks like the statue Madam Twiddle mentioned.",
  "playerfemale_31494": "Why are there so many vases around here?",
  "playerfemale_31495": "I suppose I should try to find all the vases.",
  "playerfemale_31496": "I think there should only be a few more vases.",
  "playerfemale_31497": "That's it! I should tell Madam Twiddle about what happened.",
  "playerfemale_31512": "Professor Sharp's class, yes.",
  "playerfemale_31513": "A little turbulent, and it's wanting for a bit of speed, but – it fared well enough.",
  "playerfemale_31516": "How deep are we going?",
  "playerfemale_31518": "I don't know. But, I found this floating above that – basin.",
  "playerfemale_31522": "I know a way out.",
  "playerfemale_31528": "Hmm – the location marked on the map isn't far from here.",
  "playerfemale_31530": "Certainly looks to be the place.",
  "playerfemale_31531": "Where in Merlin's name am I?",
  "playerfemale_31532": "This can't be it. Must be a way through.",
  "playerfemale_31533": "There we go.",
  "playerfemale_31534": "Should've expected company.",
  "playerfemale_31536": "I couldn't have done it without your help, Deek. Thank you.",
  "playerfemale_31537": "Wait. Is that the Hippogriff from my treasure map?",
  "playerfemale_31543": "Seems whoever enchanted those brooms was more concerned with cleanliness than with cooking.",
  "playerfemale_31544": "I wonder who this is?",
  "playerfemale_31545": "Someone was an avid reader. Can't say I'm familiar with many of these titles.",
  "playerfemale_31555": "Hello sir. I don't believe we've met.",
  "playerfemale_31557": "Well, that's everything. Better go and find Natty.",
  "playerfemale_31558": "There's the cabinet. How do I get this key in there?",
  "playerfemale_31559": "Hello, Nellie. I managed to get a Daedalian key into its lock.",
  "playerfemale_31560": "A curious token of some sort.",
  "playerfemale_31562": "A Daedalian Key. Wonder where it might lead me?",
  "playerfemale_31563": "This must be my house chest. I just need to insert the token.",
  "playerfemale_31564": "Here we are, the last house token. Time to see what's inside.",
  "playerfemale_31565": "Well, that didn't work.",
  "playerfemale_31566": "That's it!",
  "playerfemale_31567": "An old coin? Perhaps Nellie knows what it means.",
  "playerfemale_31568": "I should see this through and find the Gryffindor house chest.",
  "playerfemale_31569": "Seems I'll need to find more house tokens if I'm to open this. Quite a few, by the look of it.",
  "playerfemale_31570": "Well look at that. Thanks goes to the former Headmistress, Eupraxia Mole.",
  "playerfemale_31571": "Another house token for the house chest.",
  "playerfemale_31572": "This Daedalian Keys Challenge is coming along nicely.",
  "playerfemale_31573": "That's it. I'm making good progress with those tokens.",
  "playerfemale_31582": "[[I'll try and help, Mr Weekes.]] Sounds as if you're really outdoing yourself. If I'm able to help, I will.",
  "playerfemale_31584": "If it means another upgrade, the pleasure's all mine.",
  "playerfemale_31586": "It rides well. Does get a tad shaky at top speed – and the handle wobbles a bit when I hit a strong gust of wind.",
  "playerfemale_31593": "It seems happy to come with me. I wonder if it could travel in the nab-sack.",
  "playerfemale_31594": "Pardon me, sir –",
  "playerfemale_31595": "[[Perhaps I can look for the thief.]] I could keep an eye out for the thief, sir.",
  "playerfemale_31596": "Mr Haggarty, can you remind what we spoke about?",
  "playerfemale_31597": "I have some good news, Mr Haggarty. I unmasked your thief.",
  "playerfemale_31606": "Perfect. Let's see what we've got.",
  "playerfemale_31607": "This must be what all the fuss was about.",
  "playerfemale_31631": "What do you suppose we should be looking for?",
  "playerfemale_31641": "I see something up ahead!",
  "playerfemale_31643": "When I moved towards the glow, it suddenly seemed as if the ground was swirling about.",
  "playerfemale_31644": "Yes, sir. I'm fine.",
  "playerfemale_31656": "That statue. It looks like the symbol I've been seeing.",
  "playerfemale_31657": "That looks like a different room through the archway –",
  "playerfemale_31658": "Is there something I can help you with, Mr –?",
  "playerfemale_31660": "[[I'm sorry.]] I'm very sorry to hear about your friend.",
  "playerfemale_31661": "[[I think he did deserve it.]] Sounds like Milo knew exactly what he was in for – and risked your life as well.",
  "playerfemale_31662": "[[I may be able to help.]] If I have time, I can try to collect the heirloom watch, Mr Adley.",
  "playerfemale_31664": "Could you please remind me what you needed help with?",
  "playerfemale_31665": "Mr Adley, I retrieved the heirloom pocket watch from Milo's body.",
  "playerfemale_31666": "[[Here it is.]] I'm glad Milo's daughter will have something to remember him by.",
  "playerfemale_31667": "[[I'd like a reward.]] This was quite difficult to retrieve. Shouldn't I get a reward for my trouble?",
  "playerfemale_31668": "Now where could that Acromantula cave be?",
  "playerfemale_31669": "This could be the Acromantula cave Mr Adley mentioned.",
  "playerfemale_31670": "Now that's taken care of, I need to find the heirloom for Milo's daughter.",
  "playerfemale_31671": "I need to bring this heirloom back to Mr Adley.",
  "playerfemale_31672": "Flying tips and a jaunt around Hogwarts. This is quite the tour, Everett.",
  "playerfemale_31674": "Hello. Is there something I can help you with?",
  "playerfemale_31675": "[[How condescending.]] How – magnanimous.",
  "playerfemale_31676": "[[I'll try and find some for you.]] I can try and find some for you if I have the time.",
  "playerfemale_31681": "I – I'm not sure I know what you're talking about.",
  "playerfemale_31682": "Actually sir, the thief was a Niffler.",
  "playerfemale_31693": "Aaaa- haaaaah!",
  "playerfemale_31694": "It's incredible, isn't it!",
  "playerfemale_31695": "Ho – ohhhhh!",
  "playerfemale_31696": "[[Happy to help.]] I'm glad I could help protect Cragcroft from the Ashwinders.",
  "playerfemale_31697": "[[I need a bigger reward.]] Surely the safety of Cragcroft is worth more. I'd hate for the Ashwinders to know who offered a bounty on Selwyn.",
  "playerfemale_31702": "Is everything all right?",
  "playerfemale_31703": "Hazel?",
  "playerfemale_31704": "I'm sorry to hear that.",
  "playerfemale_31705": "[[I shall see what I can do.]] I'll keep an eye out for your unicorn friend and take her to safety if I see her.",
  "playerfemale_31709": "[[How did you become friends with her?]] How did you become so close with a unicorn?",
  "playerfemale_31711": "Hello, Mrs Bugbrooke. What was it you needed help with?",
  "playerfemale_31718": "Might be interesting to see where this leads.",
  "playerfemale_31719": "This looks like the entrance indicated on the map.",
  "playerfemale_31721": "Why is this door locked?",
  "playerfemale_31723": "Must be something around here I can climb on.",
  "playerfemale_31724": "Brilliant! The first piece of the puzzle.",
  "playerfemale_31725": "One down. Two to go.",
  "playerfemale_31728": "Success!",
  "playerfemale_31729": "Inferi! What are they protecting?",
  "playerfemale_31730": "Let's hope you stay dead this time.",
  "playerfemale_31731": "Hmm. The nine rocks on the map.",
  "playerfemale_31732": "That's odd. The markings are different on the map.",
  "playerfemale_31733": "Eureka!",
  "playerfemale_31734": "Glad to have got something after defeating those Inferi.",
  "playerfemale_31735": "Where on earth is this leading me?",
  "playerfemale_31741": "I'd say that I agree with you.",
  "playerfemale_31742": "Sounds like a good idea.",
  "playerfemale_31746": "Are you – holding your breath again?",
  "playerfemale_31747": "Oh, yes. She mentioned it to me. It contains some of her late husband's belongings.",
  "playerfemale_31749": "[[What was the heirloom she stole from you?]] What exactly was the family heirloom that the thief stole?",
  "playerfemale_31750": "[[Why would Catrin return to rob the hamlet?]] Why would Catrin come back to rob the hamlet if she'd already left?",
  "playerfemale_31751": "[[What makes you think Catrin did this?]] Are you sure Catrin is the culprit? It could be anyone.",
  "playerfemale_31752": "You got all of that from simply standing here?",
  "playerfemale_31753": "That's what Professor Rackham meant when he spoke of my needing an 'ability to interact with beasts.'",
  "playerfemale_31754": "Tell me more about what needs to be done, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_31770": "Professor Fig?",
  "playerfemale_31772": "You know – small, furry, pilfering? I followed it to its lair.",
  "playerfemale_31773": "[[I did find your heirloom.]] As a matter of fact I did.",
  "playerfemale_31774": "I'm sorry Mr Haggarty, I wish I could say that I had.",
  "playerfemale_31791": "[[There is, in fact.]] We did take a bit of a detour on the way here. Ended up exploring some ruins and – I shouldn't say more.",
  "playerfemale_31792": "[[I'm afraid there isn't.]] I'm sorry, Professor, but I'm afraid that's all there is to it.",
  "playerfemale_31793": "They did, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_31801": "Was this statue pointing the other way before?",
  "playerfemale_31802": "What was that?",
  "playerfemale_31804": "Appears there's a bit more to do before I can get through that door.",
  "playerfemale_31810": "Hello, Natty. How are you? I hope you've recovered from our rather eventful trip to Hogsmeade.",
  "playerfemale_31812": "Enchanted mannequins? What type of shop was this before I bought it?",
  "playerfemale_31826": "Poachers? Let's see how the Lord of the Shore feels about his neighbourhood being invaded.",
  "playerfemale_31827": "Didn't anyone ever teach you not to take things that don't belong to you?",
  "playerfemale_31828": "It'll take more than this to stop the Lord of the Shore.",
  "playerfemale_31829": "We're crossing that bridge whether you like it or not.",
  "playerfemale_31830": "Time for you all to clear out.",
  "playerfemale_31841": "[[What did Herodiana Byrne do?]] How did Herodiana Byrne become famous by casting <i>Depulso</i>?",

  "playerfemale_32019": "I owe you an apology, Ominis. I wasn't honest with you before about the Undercroft. Sebastian did show it to me.",

  "playerfemale_32380": "It is. The reflection's still there. But the statues' positions don't match.",
  "playerfemale_32381": "Wait! When you moved, the reflection turned in the direction of the light.",
  "playerfemale_32382": "Now the reflection is turning towards me.",
  "playerfemale_32383": "It does follow the light.",
  "playerfemale_32384": "Perhaps I need to align the statues with their reflections –",
  "playerfemale_32385": "Here we go.",
  "playerfemale_32386": "I suppose I'm on my own this time.",
  "playerfemale_32388": "I need to align these statues with their reflections.",
  "playerfemale_32389": "[[I'll see you there.]] I'll find you at the tower as soon as I can.",
  "playerfemale_32391": "Where am I to meet you, Professor?",
  "playerfemale_32393": "[[Do you know anything about the tower?]] You said that you 'know' that tower. What can you tell me about it?",
  "playerfemale_32396": "I would've paid to see that.",
  "playerfemale_32398": "[[It's almost too much.]] The blast does heat things up. I see how you lost your eyebrows.",
  "playerfemale_32399": "[[I'm ready for more spells like this.]] This is exactly the type of magic I've been hoping to learn.",
  "playerfemale_32407": "Thank you, Professor. The Room is full of possibilities.",
  "playerfemale_32408": "How did that happen?",
  "playerfemale_32413": "I'll tell you what I can.  Rookwood and Ranrok are trying to recover something they think I took from a vault in Gringotts.",
  "playerfemale_32414": "[[I'll tell you the truth.]] You must promise to keep this between us.",
  "playerfemale_32415": "[[Do you have a knack for Potions, too?]] Seems you enjoy brewing. Might I assume that you've a talent for potions of all sorts?",
  "playerfemale_32417": "How is Everett flying so quickly?",
  "playerfemale_32418": "A reservoir of ancient magic – downstairs, near the entry.",
  "playerfemale_32419": "I've seen this before – in Gringotts and the Restricted Section.",
  "playerfemale_32421": "Do you think this was damaged by the fire the night that Anne was cursed?",
  "playerfemale_32425": "Another passageway. We should search the room first.",
  "playerfemale_32427": "Thank you, Professor. I shall keep an eye out.",
  "playerfemale_32433": "[[Sounds intriguing.]] Following a Hogwarts treasure map? Count me in.",
  "playerfemale_32434": "[[Not sure it's worth my time.]] Why would I want to decipher an old map?",
  "playerfemale_32435": "I found what I believe is an authentic historian's uniform.",
  "playerfemale_32436": "Aha! There was a doorway hidden within the portrait.",
  "playerfemale_32437": "I wonder what came of Arthur's search.",
  "playerfemale_32447": "[[I'll see what I can do.]] I'll keep an eye out for a large white Diricawl.",
  "playerfemale_32449": "[[It was easy.]] Not too bad, if you know what you're doing.",
  "playerfemale_32450": "[[It was a challenge.]] She was difficult to track down, but I managed in the end.",
  "playerfemale_32451": "[[Yes.]] Of course.",
  "playerfemale_32452": "[[It will cost you.]] Yes. But, I'll be expecting payment first.",
  "playerfemale_32453": "This must be the Diricawl den that Miss Moffett told me about. Now where is Gwyneira?",
  "playerfemale_32454": "That's the one!",
  "playerfemale_32455": "This is the Diricawl den. But Miss Moffett said Gwyneira only appears at night.",
  "playerfemale_32456": "Got her! Now I need to let Miss Moffett know.",
  "playerfemale_32458": "A journal entry by Isidora.",
  "playerfemale_32467": "[[Those are all my questions.]] Thank you, Professor. I have no more questions.",
  "playerfemale_32468": "[[How do I use Alteration?]] How do I use the Altering spell?",
  "playerfemale_32469": "[[What does the Altering spell do?]] What can I customise with the Altering spell?",
  "playerfemale_32470": "[[I'm keeping her.]] Actually, I think she'll be safer with me.",
  "playerfemale_32471": "[[Perhaps I'll have a look.]] Very well. I shall take a look if I can find the time.",
  "playerfemale_32473": "[[Oh, then never mind.]] In that case, all right. Here's the heirloom watch.",
  "playerfemale_32474": "[[Maybe you can sell the watch.]] I don't think you realise the trouble I went to retrieving the watch. Perhaps you can sell it for the girl's supplies.",
  "playerfemale_32478": "I wish all Slytherins could talk to snakes.",
  "playerfemale_32479": "I'd like to be able to talk to snakes.",
  "playerfemale_32490": "You don't know that history will repeat itself. Besides, you said your aunt thought like you. This could honour her memory –",
  "playerfemale_32494": "– get you answers about Slytherin, and Sebastian answers for Anne. Your aunt pursued this alone. We could do it together.",
  "playerfemale_32495": "Honestly, I'm not entirely certain. All I know is that I can see whispers of an old magic that hardly anyone else can.",
  "playerfemale_32497": "Hello Deek. Professor Weasley said you wanted to tell me more about the loom.",
  "playerfemale_32507": "Where are we meeting, Sebastian?",
  "playerfemale_32508": "Leave her alone.",
  "playerfemale_32509": "Is that ice?",
  "playerfemale_32510": "And how is there a room behind it?",
  "playerfemale_32512": "There's that glow again – like the glow on the Portkey container!",
  "playerfemale_32513": "Ugh. Thank you, Peeves. Another obstacle in my path.",
  "playerfemale_32515": "The man we saw before – Percival Rackham – was a professor here.",
  "playerfemale_32517": "How many of them are there?",
  "playerfemale_32518": "It seems I have no choice – I'm going to have to fight my way out of here.",
  "playerfemale_32522": "Milo?",
  "playerfemale_32523": "The Absconder?",
  "playerfemale_32524": "The trolls were Ranrok's distraction so that Rookwood could get to me. And he would have – had Sirona and the patrons at the Three Broomsticks not intervened.",
  "playerfemale_32526": "But sir, how dangerous could the library be? Perhaps we're only after a book.",
  "playerfemale_32527": "That's one egg sac destroyed. I should get the rest.",
  "playerfemale_32528": "Half finished – but I need to destroy all of the egg sacs.",
  "playerfemale_32529": "Good. No more egg sacs.",
  "playerfemale_32531": "Hello, Mr Pippin. You need help with a delivery?",
  "playerfemale_32534": "What do you need delivered?",
  "playerfemale_32535": "I recognise you from the Pensieves. You're Professor Rackham.",
  "playerfemale_32559": "Well said. Now, where do we go from here?",
  "playerfemale_32564": "Another gate.",
  "playerfemale_32565": "Sounds – versatile.",
  "playerfemale_32566": "Appreciate the confidence.",
  "playerfemale_32570": "I'm the same age that you and Isidora Morganach were when you started at Hogwarts.",
  "playerfemale_32571": "To see traces of ancient magic? Yes, sir. I do.",
  "playerfemale_32572": "I don't have the book with me, sir.",
  "playerfemale_32574": "[[I don't have any questions after all.]] Actually, I don't think I have any questions.",
  "playerfemale_32577": "[[It's to do with Ranrok.]] Seems he's working with Ranrok. And Ranrok is after something I found at Gringotts.",
  "playerfemale_32578": "[[I'm – not entirely certain.]] I've never even met him. Perhaps he mistook me for another student.",
  "playerfemale_32579": "Professor Fig and I ended up there after the dragon attack. It's quite the tale – Fig had this Portkey –",
  "playerfemale_32583": "Well, that's everything. Better go and find Sebastian.",
  "playerfemale_32584": "I suppose so. It's all a bit of a blur, to be honest.",
  "playerfemale_32587": "I know Ominis. Met him in our common room. I've noticed he uses his wand to navigate the castle.",
  "playerfemale_32588": "I think I've seen Ominis in Potions. Or was it Herbology? I've noticed that he uses his wand to navigate the castle.",
  "playerfemale_32589": "I'm not sure where to start.",
  "playerfemale_32598": "I barely follow myself – and I was there. Anyway, we ended up in an ancient vault where we found a map. That map leads to the Restricted Section.",
  "playerfemale_32599": "Deadly serious. Professor Fig has insisted that I not tell a soul about any of this. I've probably said too much.",
  "playerfemale_32600": "I need to find something for Professor Fig, but it's in the Restricted Section of the Library.",
  "playerfemale_32601": "He was called away by Black at the last moment. I suppose I could wait to get a note from him, but –",
  "playerfemale_32602": "Precisely. You mentioned being 'clever enough not to get caught' in the Restricted Section.",
  "playerfemale_32606": "– the mallowsweet is meant to be placed at the centre of the symbols?",
  "playerfemale_32608": "That's what we're trying to find out.",
  "playerfemale_32611": "[[Happy to help.]] I'd be happy to help with the delivery.",
  "playerfemale_32612": "[[She sounds annoying.]] I'd rather not deal with difficult people, but for a reward I think I can manage.",
  "playerfemale_32613": "Sir? Could you remind me about the delivery you needed help with?",
  "playerfemale_32615": "[[Very well.]] (sigh) Very well, I shall let Mr Pippin know I delivered the potions as requested.",
  "playerfemale_32616": "Madam Lawang? I have a delivery from J. Pippin's Potions.",
  "playerfemale_32617": "[[Here are the potions.]] Here are the potions you requested.",
  "playerfemale_32618": "[[Why did you buy them then?]] Why do you keep ordering from him if you think the quality to be inferior?",
  "playerfemale_32619": "[[Of course.]] Seems simple enough. I'll do it.",
  "playerfemale_32620": "I delivered the potions to Fatimah Lawang.",
  "playerfemale_32621": "[[It was no problem.]] Nothing to worry about. I handled it.",
  "playerfemale_32622": "[[She's certainly difficult.]] I can see why you didn't want to go. She was quite cantankerous.",
  "playerfemale_32624": "Our interests will never be aligned.",
  "playerfemale_32625": "Charles Rookwood wouldn't have wanted you near it.",
  "playerfemale_32626": "I've no idea what you’re talking about.",
  "playerfemale_32628": "Imelda Reyes? Albie Weekes sent me –",
  "playerfemale_32633": "[[A goblin named Lodgok.]] A friendly goblin. He wants no part in Ranrok's fight.",
  "playerfemale_32634": "[[They asked me not to say anything.]] Someone who knows Ranrok personally. They asked me not to mention their name to anyone.",
  "playerfemale_32635": "[[That was cruel.]] Perhaps your uncle was right about you. You don't know when to stop.",
  "playerfemale_32636": "I do. I also see why you refer to this room as the 'Map Chamber.'",
  "playerfemale_32639": "So, the passage from your ruins to Gringotts, everything in the vault, the Restricted Section, finding this room – none of these was a trial?",
  "playerfemale_32644": "You're not a bad chap – for a Slytherin.",
  "playerfemale_32647": "I do. But, not all goblins – ",
  "playerfemale_32658": "What do we do now? Ominis is not going to cast the Cruciatus Curse again.",
  "playerfemale_32659": "Wait – you didn't say you knew how to cast <i>Crucio</i>.",
  "playerfemale_32660": "[[Teach me the Cruciatus Curse and I'll cast it on you.]] I want to learn the curse, and I think it's best if I cast it on you.",
  "playerfemale_32661": "[[I want to learn the Cruciatus Curse. But you must cast it on me.]] I want to learn the curse, but I won't cast it on you. You need to cast it on me.",
  "playerfemale_32662": "[[Very well. I don't want to learn the Cruciatus Curse.]] I don't want to learn the curse, but I can handle the pain. It's fine. Cast it on me.",
  "playerfemale_32665": "That pain – it was excruciating. But, I'll survive. Let's keep moving.",
  "playerfemale_32668": "Sebastian. Ominis. There's a book, just here.",
  "playerfemale_32672": "[[I'll see you at the forest.]] I suppose if that's the only way for me to get those pages, I'll meet you at the forest.",
  "playerfemale_32673": "[[Where are we to meet?]] Where did you suggest we meet?",
  "playerfemale_32674": "[[How did you steal from Peeves?]] How is it possible to steal from Peeves – a Poltergeist?",
  "playerfemale_32675": "[[I'll see you at the forest.]] If that's the only way for me to get those pages, I'll meet you there.",
  "playerfemale_32685": "[[I won't say a word.]] I see no reason to involve Ominis.",
  "playerfemale_32686": "[[We should tell Ominis.]] We need to tell him. He's the reason we found the book and he deserves to know what you've learned.",
  "playerfemale_32697": "What will you do with Slytherin's spellbook?",
  "playerfemale_32710": "[[The spellbook is giving Sebastian hope.]] Those references in the book seem promising.",
  "playerfemale_32712": "Did you get what you needed for your sister?",
  "playerfemale_32713": "Of course, Officer.",
  "playerfemale_32714": "I was happy to help.",
  "playerfemale_32719": "Oh? What's so special about them?",
  "playerfemale_32722": "Spend a lot of time in detention, do you?",
  "playerfemale_32726": "It’s my first time here.",
  "playerfemale_32727": "Thank you for this.",
  "playerfemale_32728": "I promise to tell you everything, but it’s perhaps best I do that later.",
  "playerfemale_32729": "It's my first time here.",
  "playerfemale_32730": "Thank you for this.",
  "playerfemale_32731": "I promise to tell you everything, but it's perhaps best that I do that later.",
  "playerfemale_32732": "[[I can try.]] I'll do my best. I can promise to speak with him about it.",
  "playerfemale_32733": "[[Sebastian's made up his mind.]] I'm afraid it's really up to Sebastian, and his mind seems to be made up.",
  "playerfemale_32739": "[[How do I collect materials?]] How should I collect magical materials?",
  "playerfemale_32758": "Archie? Archie Bickle?",
  "playerfemale_32773": "Sebastian – over here.",
  "playerfemale_32775": "Someone piled this here for a reason. Is it blocking something?",
  "playerfemale_32776": "Whose home was this?",
  "playerfemale_32779": "Hmm. It's a wonder the Ministry isn't doing more.",
  "playerfemale_32783": "You did not. Sounds worth looking into. Any idea where in the castle?",
  "playerfemale_32802": "I'm sorry you experienced something like that at so young an age.",
  "playerfemale_32803": "You must miss him.",
  "playerfemale_32804": "I wonder what Archie saw. I hope he didn't see Harlow kill his father.",
  "playerfemale_32807": "[[You can tell me.]] I'd like to know more about it, if you wouldn't mind telling me. I won't repeat it.",
  "playerfemale_32808": "[[You don't have to tell me.]] I understand. You needn't tell me if you don't want to.",
  "playerfemale_32832": "I wonder why.",
  "playerfemale_32834": "Hmm. Not everyone does.",
  "playerfemale_32836": "I don't know. I did see another memory. This time it was a Keeper named Niamh Fitzgerald.",
  "playerfemale_32840": "What were you thinking?",
  "playerfemale_32843": "[[He had no choice.]] How horrible. Poor Ominis. He was only a child. He shouldn't blame himself.",
  "playerfemale_32844": "[[He should have known better.]] That's awful. But, no matter the circumstance, he should never have cast it. He should have known better.",
  "playerfemale_32845": "[[The Dark Arts are dangerous.]] Ominis is right. Meddling in the Dark Arts is dangerous.",
  "playerfemale_32846": "[[I'm curious about the Dark Arts.]] The Dark Arts do pique my interest.",
  "playerfemale_32852": "[[I'm ready to go now.]] Of course. Shall we leave now?",
  "playerfemale_32854": "Thank you for humouring me.",
  "playerfemale_32855": "[[I am.]] I believe I am.",
  "playerfemale_32856": "[[Not quite.]] Just a few more minutes if that's all right.",
  "playerfemale_32857": "I can't believe any of what just happened.",
  "playerfemale_32858": "[[No. I'm ready to go.]] No. I think I'm ready to leave if you are.",
  "playerfemale_32859": "[[Yes, I'd like a few more minutes.]] Yes, just a few more minutes.",
  "playerfemale_32861": "Wait here. I'll run ahead.",
  "playerfemale_32863": "I'll draw her attention. Follow when it's safe.",
  "playerfemale_32870": "I am ready to do what's needed to take Harlow down. I know you have a plan.",
  "playerfemale_32875": "What was in the note?",
  "playerfemale_32876": "What did he ask you to do?",
  "playerfemale_32887": "[[That is what I needed.]] Thank you, Mrs Rabe. Knowing the lengths that Harlow will go to is helpful, albeit more than disturbing.",
  "playerfemale_32889": "[[Does the note confirm kidnapping?]] Are you sure the note means that your husband was kidnapped?",
  "playerfemale_32890": "[[Not at all. But I am ready to head back.]] Shall we head back? I'm ready if you are.",
  "playerfemale_32891": "[[I'm not ready to leave.]] I was hoping to look around for a moment, if you don't mind – take it all in.",
  "playerfemale_32895": "I hope Professor Fitzgerald has confirmed what she needed to. I have to complete the next trial as soon as I can.",
  "playerfemale_32897": "Hello, Professor. I have news. The goblins are looking for something. Another 'repository'. They've built drills to help with their search.",
  "playerfemale_32899": "I understand. Very well. I'll find some way to get in.",
  "playerfemale_32900": "How will I gain access to the Headmaster's office? Perhaps Professor Fig will know what to do.",
  "playerfemale_32901": "Professor Fig, the Keepers have shown me where the next trial is.",
  "playerfemale_32902": "Lodgok and I have learned that the goblins are searching for another repository – like the one we saw at Rookwood Castle.",
  "playerfemale_32903": "They encountered each other at Rookwood Castle. She was doing research. That's where she found the container with the Portkey.",
  "playerfemale_32904": "He liked her so much that he let her leave with it – despite orders from Ranrok.",
  "playerfemale_32906": "Wait, doesn't Polyjuice Potion require a bit of the person you want to change into? And take ages to brew?",
  "playerfemale_32907": "Incredible. I won't forget that taste any time soon.  How do I sound?",
  "playerfemale_32908": "I see. But what if Professor Black sees me?",
  "playerfemale_32909": "Thank you, Professor. I suppose we'll meet again in the Map Chamber.",
  "playerfemale_32911": "You could have got us killed.",
  "playerfemale_32916": "Wait! We should have some sort of plan.",
  "playerfemale_32917": "Did you hear that goblin?",
  "playerfemale_32919": "Sebastian – wait.",
  "playerfemale_32921": "These spiders are determined to make a meal of us.",
  "playerfemale_32926": "Can't we talk about this?",
  "playerfemale_32927": "How are you doing, Sebastian?",
  "playerfemale_32928": "I can be sneaky. Let's go.",
  "playerfemale_32945": "But, Professor –",
  "playerfemale_32946": "[[I need to ask you about a certain goblin.]] Hello, Miss Ryan. I wanted to thank you again for your help with Rookwood and Harlow the day of the troll attack.",
  "playerfemale_32947": "Miss Broom. A word.",
  "playerfemale_32953": "Pleasure to meet you.  Wait. Are you related to Professor Weasley?",
  "playerfemale_32954": "If you're sure.",
  "playerfemale_32955": "The Polyjuice Potion's wearing off. I'd best get out of sight. ",
  "playerfemale_32956": "Clopton, isn't it? Please, call me Phineas from now on. Consider it a special privilege.",
  "playerfemale_32957": "I wonder if all the elite wizarding families have a motto.",
  "playerfemale_32958": "The gargoyle. That's where I need to speak the password.",
  "playerfemale_32964": "It is, and I have.",
  "playerfemale_32965": "Oh, and as you've probably guessed by now, your Polyjuice plan worked like a charm.",
  "playerfemale_32966": "I should ask Sirona at the Three Broomsticks about the goblin she was talking to the day of the troll attack.",
  "playerfemale_32968": "[[I'm not sure that's a good idea.]] I don't know Garreth, I don't want to get on Sharp's bad side.",
  "playerfemale_32969": "[[I'm sorry. I can't.]] I've enough to worry about collecting the ingredients he wants me to get. I'm afraid I can't help you.",
  "playerfemale_32970": "Hmm. I don't believe I've met Mrs Sprottle.",
  "playerfemale_32971": "[[I don't know what you mean.]] I'm not sure what you're talking about, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_32972": "I'm glad I was able to meet your expectations.",
  "playerfemale_32976": "Are you all right?",
  "playerfemale_32978": "The book of poems that was taken from Agabus Philbert. He'll be thrilled to have this back.",
  "playerfemale_32979": "Otto Dibble's love letter from Rosie. He wanted me to destroy this if I found it.",
  "playerfemale_32980": "Natty must be here somewhere.",
  "playerfemale_32982": "Use mine. We'll find yours together once you're out of there.",
  "playerfemale_32983": "Understood. I'll find it.",
  "playerfemale_32985": "Impressive.",
  "playerfemale_32986": "What have the Keepers planned for me?",
  "playerfemale_32987": "These are never a welcome sight. At least I know what to expect this time.",
  "playerfemale_32988": "Hmm. Another memory. Now to find a way out of here.",
  "playerfemale_32992": "[[In the future, please call the authorities.]] I hope the next time Rookwood's lot comes calling, you'll alert the authorities.",
  "playerfemale_32993": "Actually, Officer Singer – Natty and I learned of several Hogsmeade residents who've had their lives threatened by the Ashwinders.",
  "playerfemale_32997": "[[How are you hiding the extortion?]] What have you been doing to keep the extortion a secret?",
  "playerfemale_32999": "[[Why would Harlow take your husband and not you?]] Why wouldn't Harlow extort your husband?",
  "playerfemale_33000": "[[Have you given Harlow any information about Gringotts?]] Have you helped Harlow since your husband was taken?",
  "playerfemale_33008": "Oh. Uh – yes. A friend of Professor Fig's.",
  "playerfemale_33009": "[[Not afraid of heights, are you?]] I take it you're not afraid of heights.",
  "playerfemale_33010": "I have everything. I see what you meant about not being able to pick a favourite shop.",
  "playerfemale_33015": "[[I'm not ready to tell you everything.]] The book I found in the Restricted Section was missing some pages. That's about it.",
  "playerfemale_33016": "All right. I can see traces of ancient magic.",
  "playerfemale_33019": "Pleasure to meet you, Cressida.",
  "playerfemale_33020": "[[Not at all.]] No. I merely studied with him briefly before we arrived.",
  "playerfemale_33021": "[[I've studied with him.]] I'm not sure I'd say that. But I did study with him a little before we arrived.",
  "playerfemale_33022": "Is that what you were trying to do just there?",
  "playerfemale_33023": "Professor Fig and I wound up there after the dragon attack. There was this Portkey –",
  "playerfemale_33024": "Well, it's all a bit convoluted –",
  "playerfemale_33025": "[[I don't want to impose.]] If your sister is unwell, she may not want visitors.",
  "playerfemale_33033": "Poor Sebastian. Not the visit he'd hoped for.",
  "playerfemale_33034": "I ought to see how Sebastian's faring.",
  "playerfemale_33036": "I seem to be collecting bits of stone when I vanish these objects.",
  "playerfemale_33037": "Sebastian –",
  "playerfemale_33052": "Of course. Ominis spoke to me about his family when we first met. To say that he has 'no love lost' for them is an understatement.",
  "playerfemale_33053": "Understood. But, why does Ominis have 'no love lost' for his family?",
  "playerfemale_33055": "He and Ranrok were close once, but they had a falling out.",
  "playerfemale_33056": "Lodgok did mention that Ranrok is searching for something, but he couldn't say what.",
  "playerfemale_33062": "Very well, sir. I'm on my way.",
  "playerfemale_33069": "It looks empty. If they've taken all of it, why are they still here?",
  "playerfemale_33070": "Professor Rookwood, the goblins and Dark wizards who've overrun your castle are digging for 'stores of magic' –",
  "playerfemale_33073": "Hello, Grace. What are you doing here?",
  "playerfemale_33074": "I suppose so!",
  "playerfemale_33075": "Fig and I think that Ranrok has somehow found a way to harness that magic's power.",
  "playerfemale_33076": "There. Can hardly tell a troll barrelled through it.",
  "playerfemale_33083": "I have a rare ability to see whispers of ancient magic.",
  "playerfemale_33084": "I'm not entirely sure, but the Keepers have said that it's a powerful magic that should only be wielded by a select few.",
  "playerfemale_33096": "Very well, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_33102": "I've actually met Mrs Sprottle. I recently spoke with her about her friend Claire Beaumont.",
  "playerfemale_33103": "[[I spoke with him.]] I did, thank you. We had a good conversation. He sends you his best.",
  "playerfemale_33104": "Mr Rabe? Daisy told me you'd been abducted.",
  "playerfemale_33105": "Worried about you. Are you all right?",
  "playerfemale_33106": "Why hide a triptych here?",
  "playerfemale_33107": "A note – let's have a look.",
  "playerfemale_33108": "[[You're not thinking straight.]] You don't know what you're saying. Take a breath for a moment.",
  "playerfemale_33110": "Hello, Lucan. I'd like to practise with the training dummy.",
  "playerfemale_33111": "[[Yes.]] That'd be brilliant.",
  "playerfemale_33112": "[[Perhaps later.]] Actually, I might come back later.",
  "playerfemale_33113": "Hello, Lucan. I'm ready for practice.",
  "playerfemale_33114": "[[Couldn't have done it without you.]] Thanks, Lucan. You've been a great help.",
  "playerfemale_33115": "[[It was just a dummy.]] It was only a training dummy.",
  "playerfemale_33116": "Nice to see you again Mrs Sprottle. Actually, Sirona Ryan asked if I'd come and see you.",
  "playerfemale_33119": "[[I am.]] <i>Crucio</i>, correct? The Cruciatus Curse – also known as the Torture Curse. Inflicts excruciating pain on the victim.",
  "playerfemale_33120": "[[I'm not.]] What does the Cruciatus Curse do?",
  "playerfemale_33136": "Now to find the Headmaster's house-elf.",
  "playerfemale_33138": "Perhaps I'll have to purchase a broom then.",
  "playerfemale_33142": "Hello, I don't believe we've met.",
  "playerfemale_33143": "[[What happened to Sebastian's parents?]] I knew his parents died, but I never heard what happened.",
  "playerfemale_33144": "[[Such a tragic loss.]] Poor Anne and Sebastian.",
  "playerfemale_33149": "You'd like me to report back with even more flight details?",
  "playerfemale_33150": "Hello, Mr Weekes. Did you still need help with your broom upgrades?",
  "playerfemale_33151": "Hello again, Mr Weekes. I set a new record at the south course!",
  "playerfemale_33152": "Very well. I shall let you know when I have some.",
  "playerfemale_33153": "[[Can any beast produce materials?]] Will all of my beasts produce magical materials?",
  "playerfemale_33156": "[[The spellbook is concerning.]] Some references Sebastian mentioned in the book do worry me.",
  "playerfemale_33165": "[[Are you a painter?]] You mentioned that your paintings were taken. Are you a painter?",
  "playerfemale_33167": "[[Happy to be rid of it.]] Of course. Glad to hand it over, frankly.",
  "playerfemale_33168": "[[I'd like to be paid.]] It wasn't as easy to come by as I had expected. I'd like to be paid for my troubles.",
  "playerfemale_33170": "[[If it helps me, I suppose I could check on Tobbs.]] Well, I suppose if looking for Tobbs also allows me to test my enchanted clothing, then I can do it.",
  "playerfemale_33175": "Should be, Professor?",
  "playerfemale_33177": "I won't, Professor. Thank you.",
  "playerfemale_33178": "Mr Barnes will only get in trouble going down this path. I need to find another way to get him a Venomous Tentacula.",
  "playerfemale_33180": "Now I can conjure a breeding pen in the Room. Best get back to Deek with the Thestrals.",
  "playerfemale_33181": "Who is this wizard?",
  "playerfemale_33182": "Who are you? Why are we here?",
  "playerfemale_33183": "Opening all of these is tempting.",
  "playerfemale_33184": "We're in a tomb. I assume eerie sounds come with the territory.",
  "playerfemale_33185": "Hmm. Leave no stone unturned. Or in this case, no bone.",
  "playerfemale_33195": "[[How do you know the Imperius Curse?]] Where did you learn the Imperius Curse?",
  "playerfemale_33197": "[[I'd prefer not to learn the Imperius Curse.]] I don't think learning the Imperius Curse is a good idea.",
  "playerfemale_33198": "[[Yes, I'd like to learn the Imperius Curse.]] It's probably wise to know the spell.",
  "playerfemale_33199": "[[What does learning the Curse entail?]] Shouldn't I know more about what the Curse entails?",
  "playerfemale_33200": "What's happening?",
  "playerfemale_33202": "I need to get the reflections to follow the light.",
  "playerfemale_33203": "Perhaps I need to get them all to stand at once.",
  "playerfemale_33204": "Where do I need to be to get all of them to stand at once?",
  "playerfemale_33205": "Where am I supposed to go?",
  "playerfemale_33207": "Ah, here we are.",
  "playerfemale_33208": "Incredible.",
  "playerfemale_33209": "Hello there. Was there something you needed?",
  "playerfemale_33210": "[[What are magical materials for?]] What uses do magical materials have?",
  "playerfemale_33211": "[[How frustrating for you.]] That must have been frustrating for you.",
  "playerfemale_33212": "[[I can see why.]] I can see why he said that. You do seem angry.",
  "playerfemale_33213": "Yeah, spiders aren't insects.",
  "playerfemale_33215": "What did you hope would happen?",
  "playerfemale_33217": "I shall do my best. Any idea where it might be?",
  "playerfemale_33223": "Is Mr Rabe all right?",
  "playerfemale_33225": "[[Understood.]] Yes, Officer. Do you have enough evidence to take down Harlow and the rest of Rookwood's lot?",
  "playerfemale_33228": "There's something here by the altar.",
  "playerfemale_33229": "Looks like part of a student's diary. It mentions plans to return for the relic and conjuring barricades using bones.",
  "playerfemale_33235": "[[Let's explore the catacomb.]] I'm ready to explore the catacomb. Perhaps we can visit Anne when we've finished.",
  "playerfemale_33236": "And then – were abandoned?",
  "playerfemale_33245": "[[I am a bit curious.]] It's not that I'm not interested. And you can certainly trust me if you want to tell me anything.",
  "playerfemale_33246": "[[I actually should be going.]] If you learn more about that scriptorium, let me know.",
  "playerfemale_33249": "I know, I know. Continue to hone my magic.",
  "playerfemale_33251": "[[Sounds a bit dangerous.]] Might be a bit dangerous for a broom trial. I'll see what I can do.",
  "playerfemale_33253": "The best upgrade yet. It flew beautifully. Incredibly nimble.",
  "playerfemale_33256": "I should let Mr Weekes know that this was his best upgrade yet.",
  "playerfemale_33257": "That's odd. Why would someone store one hat in here?",
  "playerfemale_33258": "I don't know the Headmaster's house-elf. Will he even speak to me? I imagine he's loyal to the Headmaster.",
  "playerfemale_33259": "I'm just here for Summoner's Court.",
  "playerfemale_33260": "Bit dramatic, isn't it?",
  "playerfemale_33261": "How gracious of you.",
  "playerfemale_33265": "I doubt anyone's been here in quite some time.",
  "playerfemale_33266": "For a moment there, I thought that'd never end.",
  "playerfemale_33267": "Hold on. Don't give up yet.",
  "playerfemale_33270": "[[We should leave the relic alone.]] The note advises to leave the relic alone.",
  "playerfemale_33274": "Sophronia, could you remind what it was you needed help with?",
  "playerfemale_33276": "What do you suppose is meant by 'the Dark sacrifice required to realise the relic's potential'?",
  "playerfemale_33277": "[[We need that relic.]] I'm willing to ignore what the journal entry says. We're taking the relic.",
  "playerfemale_33279": "Hold on, both of you. Sebastian, please, take a step back.",
  "playerfemale_33280": "[[Something tells me you want to find this creature.]] I take it you aren't going to let the poachers anywhere near the Snidgets.",
  "playerfemale_33282": "[[I cannot side with you. Sebastian's right.]] Sebastian's right. We need that relic.",
  "playerfemale_33283": "[[Very well. Let's talk with Sebastian.]] You're right. This seems far riskier than Sebastian realises.",
  "playerfemale_33285": "He did, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_33286": "It does mention something else – it says their next assignment was learning the Imperius Curse.",
  "playerfemale_33292": "What exactly happened to your father?",
  "playerfemale_33293": "'Galloping'? Your father was also an Animagus, I take it?",
  "playerfemale_33294": "[[I'm so sorry, Natty.]] I'm sorry, Natty. I can't imagine what you've been through. Your father sounds exceptional.",
  "playerfemale_33295": "Yes, I remember. 'Rain does not fall on one roof alone.'",
  "playerfemale_33296": "[[Are you looking to avenge his death?]] Do you think taking down the Ashwinders will avenge your father's death?",
  "playerfemale_33297": "[[What would your father think of what we've been doing?]] Do you think your father would approve of the things we've been doing?",
  "playerfemale_33298": "I do think we should talk to him, but I fear we won't stop him from taking the relic.",
  "playerfemale_33299": "We allow Sebastian to leave with the relic under one condition: after this, no more.",
  "playerfemale_33300": "You're not, Ominis. This may be the only way to keep your friendship intact. Let's trust him to know what's best.",
  "playerfemale_33303": "Are you willing to sacrifice your friendship over this?",
  "playerfemale_33304": "[[Yes. That is precisely what I'm suggesting.]] That's what I'm saying. I would take all responsibility. This could save your friendship.",
  "playerfemale_33306": "[[Yes. That's precisely what I'm suggesting.]] That's what I'm saying. I would take all responsibility. This could save your friendship.",
  "playerfemale_33307": "What did you need me to do, Deek?",
  "playerfemale_33314": "Sebastian, we need to go.",
  "playerfemale_33315": "Sebastian – come on.",
  "playerfemale_33318": "[[I'm looking forward to my first day.]] I'm glad to be here. Ready for classes to start.",
  "playerfemale_33319": "[[I'm actually a tad nervous.]] Harrowing indeed. I'm still a bit on edge myself and a little nervous for classes to start.",
  "playerfemale_33320": "Wait – did you say 'most' professors are firm but fair?",
  "playerfemale_33321": "You too, Everett.",
  "playerfemale_33324": "I take it we can call that a success?",
  "playerfemale_33326": "No wonder Sophronia wanted to see this.",
  "playerfemale_33329": "Glad to hear it.",
  "playerfemale_33330": "[[Good game.]] Let's let bygones be bygones, shall we? You played a good game.",
  "playerfemale_33332": "[[It was terrifying.]] Professor Fig and I were lucky to escape with our lives.",
  "playerfemale_33333": "[[It was exciting.]] It was dreadful, certainly, but quite an experience nonetheless.",
  "playerfemale_33334": "It's all still a bit of a blur, to be honest.",
  "playerfemale_33338": "Actually, Professor Fig told me about Wiggenweld Potion.",
  "playerfemale_33339": "[[He's quite knowledgeable.]] Professor Fig does know a great deal about, uh, different forms of magic.",
  "playerfemale_33340": "[[I wouldn't really know.]] He did teach me a few things before term, but that's all I can tell you.",
  "playerfemale_33341": "[[Nice talking with you.]] It was nice to meet you, Samantha. Good luck with your dittany.",
  "playerfemale_33342": "[[Do most students grow their own ingredients?]] Is it common practice for students to grow their own ingredients?",
  "playerfemale_33345": "[[What was your business with Alfred Lawley?]] You said Mr Lawley was your ex-business partner. What were you working on?",
  "playerfemale_33346": "[[Why this Venomous Tentacula?]] Why do you need Mr Lawley's Venomous Tentacula in particular?",
  "playerfemale_33347": "[[What else is in the cellar?]] What else is in Mr Lawley's cellar?",
  "playerfemale_33364": "It might be best to let him calm down a while. May I speak to him? Perhaps I can help to ease the tension a bit.",
  "playerfemale_33366": "[[Natsai Onai.]] Yes, Natty.",
  "playerfemale_33367": "[[Sebastian Sallow.]] Yes, Sebastian.",
  "playerfemale_33368": "[[No.]] I'll be duelling solo.",
  "playerfemale_33373": "[[Natsai Onai.]] Yes: Natty.",
  "playerfemale_33375": "[[Sebastian Sallow.]] Yes: Sebastian.",
  "playerfemale_33376": "[[No.]] I'll go it alone.",
  "playerfemale_33377": "Where might this lead?",
  "playerfemale_33378": "Ah. I need to 'wake up' that rune over there.",
  "playerfemale_33379": "Not surprising. Guards at the ready.",
  "playerfemale_33380": "This must be the way forward – but to where?",
  "playerfemale_33381": "Nearly there. Best to keep my wits about me.",
  "playerfemale_33382": "Looks like another Pensieve up ahead. And that appears to be a giant statue of Professor Rackham.",
  "playerfemale_33384": "You can see Thestrals too?",
  "playerfemale_33392": "Ominis has. Let's go.",
  "playerfemale_33393": "I'll explain on the way. Come on.",
  "playerfemale_33398": "I'm sorry we can both see Thestrals.",
  "playerfemale_33399": "I hope Professor Fig got my owl. I need to tell him and the Keepers that Ranrok knows where the last repository is.",
  "playerfemale_33400": "Professor! You received my owl. Ranrok has the last of Bragbor's journals. He killed Lodgok to get it. He knows where the last repository is.",
  "playerfemale_33405": "Very well.",
  "playerfemale_33406": "Thank you, Professor Bakar. I shall see you back in the Map Chamber.",
  "playerfemale_33407": "This must be the last artefact. I still have no idea what these are meant for.",
  "playerfemale_33408": "Now to return to the Map Chamber, and not a moment too soon.",
  "playerfemale_33409": "The caverns below Hogwarts – where you fought Isidora. Is that the location of the final repository?",
  "playerfemale_33411": "All right, professor. I'll see you soon.",
  "playerfemale_33423": "[[How did you steal from Peeves?]] How is it possible to steal from Peeves – a Poltergeist?",
  "playerfemale_33424": "What map?",
  "playerfemale_33425": "[[How did you steal from Peeves?]] How is it possible to steal from Peeves – a Poltergeist?",
  "playerfemale_33426": "[[How did you steal from Peeves?]] How is it possible to steal from Peeves – a poltergeist?",
  "playerfemale_33431": "[[Any tips for rescuing elusive beasts?]] Do you have any advice on how I can rescue more elusive beasts?",
  "playerfemale_33432": "[[What was it like working for a poacher?]] Would you mind talking a bit more about what it was like working for your former master?",
  "playerfemale_33434": "[[How did you come to be at Hogwarts?]] How did you end up at Hogwarts after working for your former master?",
  "playerfemale_33435": "Ominis, I learned <i>Imperio</i>. I want you to know –",
  "playerfemale_33436": "We've made it this far – but clearly we have more to do.",
  "playerfemale_33440": "An 'Enchanted Loom?'",
  "playerfemale_33442": "Happy to be here. It is good to leave the classroom now and then.",
  "playerfemale_33443": "I am too. You were speaking to a goblin here that day.",
  "playerfemale_33444": "[[I'm glad to hear it.]] It seemed as though you were on good terms with him.",
  "playerfemale_33445": "[[How can you trust a goblin?]] I was surprised that you seemed friendly with a goblin.",
  "playerfemale_33446": "In that case, I'd like to talk with him – about Ranrok in particular. Where might I find him?",
  "playerfemale_33447": "[[Thank you.]] Thank you, Sirona.",
  "playerfemale_33452": "Just before we came to Hogwarts. In fact, it's why I was late to the Sorting Ceremony.",
  "playerfemale_33453": "A Portkey brought us there after the dragon attacked our carriage.",
  "playerfemale_33454": "There's one more thing. It's a bit odd, if I'm honest.",
  "playerfemale_33459": "Thank you, Natty.",
  "playerfemale_33460": "No. Actually, I wanted to speak with you. It's about Ranrok.",
  "playerfemale_33461": "I am. And I need to know what he and his Loyalists are up to – so I can stay a step ahead.",
  "playerfemale_33462": "Hello, Lucan. I'm ready for practice.",
  "playerfemale_33463": "I'm afraid he wants you nowhere near Feldcroft – nor Anne.",
  "playerfemale_33467": "[[Sirona trusts me.]] Sirona trusts me and she thought our interests may be aligned.",
  "playerfemale_33468": "[[Perhaps I misjudged you.]] Sirona said our interests may be aligned. Perhaps she was wrong.",
  "playerfemale_33474": "Be careful, Sebastian. Your uncle could intercept it. We'll be expelled.",
  "playerfemale_33478": "[[Very well. Let me know what you find.]] I shall wait to hear from you, then.",
  "playerfemale_33483": "One nudge and that chest might've fallen.",
  "playerfemale_33484": "A staircase leading here? Whatever for?",
  "playerfemale_33485": "Getting through the cavern can't have been the only challenge. Perhaps we should search for runes.",
  "playerfemale_33486": "A journal entry. Isidora was here.",
  "playerfemale_33488": "More than one.",
  "playerfemale_33489": "This journal entry sounds worrisome.",
  "playerfemale_33491": "Professor Shah, I'm interested in learning more about Astronomy.",
  "playerfemale_33492": "Thank you.",
  "playerfemale_33493": "That's quite generous. Thank you.",
  "playerfemale_33494": "I'm listening.",
  "playerfemale_33495": "What precisely is the relic I'm to retrieve?",
  "playerfemale_33496": "Wizardkind sees things differently. It's a wonder goblins and wizards have ever been able to work together.",
  "playerfemale_33497": "They seem to be.",
  "playerfemale_33498": "I do have some questions about Ranrok and the helmet.",
  "playerfemale_33502": "[[Very well. I'll go.]] I'll head there now.",
  "playerfemale_33503": "[[Perhaps I should get help.]] An entire camp of Rookwood's thieves? I might need assistance.",
  "playerfemale_33504": "This place can't have belonged to only Isidora.",
  "playerfemale_33506": "Another ancient magic passageway to the Undercroft – the final piece to the triptych must be here.",
  "playerfemale_33508": "I know from the memories I've seen that the Keepers and Isidora didn't see eye to eye on the use of ancient magic.",
  "playerfemale_33509": "Isidora must have honed her skill with ancient magic here.",
  "playerfemale_33511": "This is it.",
  "playerfemale_33513": "[[Yes you should have.]] Perhaps you should have.",
  "playerfemale_33520": "Hello, Garreth. So, has your aunt been taking it a bit easier on you lately?",
  "playerfemale_33528": "I remember Amit mentioning something about Gobbledegook.",
  "playerfemale_33529": "Hello, Amit. Do I recall you saying that you speak Gobbledegook?",
  "playerfemale_33530": "It is. His name is Lodgok. We could use your help with something.",
  "playerfemale_33531": "He's waiting for me near a goblin mine. Would you be willing to help?",
  "playerfemale_33532": "Here comes my friend Amit. Probably best to continue our conversation later.",
  "playerfemale_33533": "Bragbor?",
  "playerfemale_33534": "Why does Ranrok care so much about these repositories?",
  "playerfemale_33535": "What do you mean, ‘repositories?’",
  "playerfemale_33536": "Rookwood Castle.",
  "playerfemale_33537": "Hello, Samantha. Nice to see you again.",
  "playerfemale_33538": "Hello. You wanted to speak to me?",
  "playerfemale_33539": "[[Wasn't too challenging a lesson.]] Thank you, but it really wasn't all that challenging.",
  "playerfemale_33540": "[[What are your reasons for going after Rookwood and Harlow?]] You seem to be very determined in stopping Rookwood and Harlow. Why?",
  "playerfemale_33541": "[[Thank you.]] That's all I wanted to know.",
  "playerfemale_33542": "[[Can't we just go straight to the Ministry?]] Can't we just bypass Singer and go directly to the Ministry?",
  "playerfemale_33543": "[[Let's head to the mine, then.]] Lodgok is waiting. Shall we go?",
  "playerfemale_33544": "[[How well do you know Gobbledegook?]] You said you know Gobbledegook, but how well?",
  "playerfemale_33545": "[[Have you never met a goblin?]] Have you ever spoken directly to a goblin?",
  "playerfemale_33546": "Thank you for being willing to help me, Amit.",
  "playerfemale_33547": "A friend who speaks Gobbledegook is meeting us. Before he arrives, perhaps you could tell me why we're here.",
  "playerfemale_33548": "I'll go and experiment with the Loom now.",
  "playerfemale_33549": "What did you ask me to do with my magical materials?",
  "playerfemale_33558": "Yes, of course. Good to see you again.",
  "playerfemale_33566": "I've been wondering about something else you said before we entered the mine.",
  "playerfemale_33568": "A phoenix nest? I wonder if it belongs to the phoenix Natty mentioned; the one Harlow and the Poacher Pack are after.",
  "playerfemale_33569": "Hello. Do you have a moment?",
  "playerfemale_33570": "Hello again, Miss Wolff.",
  "playerfemale_33571": "Hello, Mr Ollivander. I wondered if you might be able to help me with something.",
  "playerfemale_33573": "Yes, sir. I have them here.",
  "playerfemale_33587": "[[Hasn't Professor Fig said anything?]] Have you and Professor Fig not discussed my training?",
  "playerfemale_33588": "[[No, Professor.]] Nothing more, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_33589": "What written plans? And why can't you come with us?",
  "playerfemale_33590": "Glad to hear it.",
  "playerfemale_33600": "I've met some interesting students in Hufflepuff. Hard-working lot, I gather.",
  "playerfemale_33601": "You're a Hufflepuff too? Always nice to see our house represented well.",
  "playerfemale_33602": "What did you discover in the spellbook we found in the scriptorium?",
  "playerfemale_33603": "Hello, Nellie. You seem excited about something.",
  "playerfemale_33604": "[[I'll look into it.]] Perhaps I'll give it a go.",
  "playerfemale_33606": "The what keys?",
  "playerfemale_33607": "Why would I do that?",
  "playerfemale_33608": "[[Why would a headmistress do such a thing?]] Why would Professor Mole conjure flying keys?",
  "playerfemale_33610": "Is everything all right?",
  "playerfemale_33611": "[[Why don't you follow the keys?]] Surely you will be trying to complete the challenge as well?",
  "playerfemale_33612": "Could you remind me how the Daedalian Keys work again?",
  "playerfemale_33613": "What am I to do, Professor Fitzgerald?",
  "playerfemale_33621": "[[This is more complicated than we thought.]] So we have to get Anne to the catacomb and then conduct a sacrifice? Seems – risky.",
  "playerfemale_33622": "[[We can do this.]] We just need to get Anne to the catacomb and work out how to make a Dark sacrifice.",
  "playerfemale_33625": "And we have to keep all of this from your uncle. If he goes to the Headmaster, we could be expelled.",
  "playerfemale_33626": "[[Might your uncle report us to the Ministry?]] Do you think your uncle would tell anyone at the Ministry about all of this if he found out?",
  "playerfemale_33630": "Hello, sir. What do you sell here?",
  "playerfemale_33635": "Hello again, Imelda. Is your challenge still on the table?",
  "playerfemale_33636": "Sounds like you're speaking from experience.",
  "playerfemale_33639": "[[I can't take your telescope.]] I can't do that, Amit. You might need it.",
  "playerfemale_33640": "Amit, you'll need to stay close to me. I've dealt with worse enemies than these.",
  "playerfemale_33641": "Keep your wits about you, Amit. I'll get you through this mine.",
  "playerfemale_33642": "We need to be careful. As I'm sure you know, not all goblins are as friendly as Lodgok – to say the least.",
  "playerfemale_33646": "Don't think I've found all the plans. I'd best keep looking.",
  "playerfemale_33647": "Let's get out of here and tell Lodgok what we've found.",
  "playerfemale_33648": "Surely my win means something.",
  "playerfemale_33657": "Ominis, I –",
  "playerfemale_33658": "[[I know. This is my fault.]] It's my fault. I was wrong. I thought he'd stop.",
  "playerfemale_33659": "[[I regret what I did.]] You were right. I do regret casting <i>Imperio</i>. I hope you can forgive me.",
  "playerfemale_33660": "I received your owl. Where's Sebastian?",
  "playerfemale_33662": "[[I did what I had to do.]] You did agree. And it did save your friendship with Sebastian.",
  "playerfemale_33663": "[[Sebastian won't listen.]] He won't listen to reason.",
  "playerfemale_33664": "Last time we were here, this place was crawling with spiders.",
  "playerfemale_33665": "Where was Sebastian when you and Anne found him?",
  "playerfemale_33666": "And there's no sign of Sebastian.",
  "playerfemale_33671": "Solomon threatened to go to the Headmaster if he heard of Sebastian dealing with Dark Magic.",
  "playerfemale_33674": "The carvings on the relic – were Inferi? And Sebastian somehow created them?",
  "playerfemale_33682": "I've actually met Scrope, but I'm not sure he'll tell me. He's rather devoted to the Black family.",
  "playerfemale_33683": "I shall. I wonder where I should conjure their pen?",
  "playerfemale_33684": "Remind me of your area of affinity, Broom. O.W.L.s are swift approaching.",
  "playerfemale_33685": "Keep at it, Broom, and before you know it you'll be as invisible as that new fifth-year seems to be.",
  "playerfemale_33686": "Hmph. Speaking of invisible – where's my blasted house-elf?",
  "playerfemale_33687": "[[I will decide what's best.]] I assure you, Sharp. You may speak freely.",
  "playerfemale_33688": "Ah! (cough) Of course. Yes. No need for all the cloak and dagger. Simply have a student deliver it.",
  "playerfemale_33689": "But – the injury, Madam Kogawa.",
  "playerfemale_33690": "Made it just in time. It's wearing off. ",
  "playerfemale_33691": "This isn't what it looks like. I can explain. ",
  "playerfemale_33692": "Fig was right. I can't believe it worked. Now to speak the password to the gargoyle.",
  "playerfemale_33693": "That must be the pedestal.",
  "playerfemale_33694": "[[Very well.]] I suspect there will be more to this than reading a book.",
  "playerfemale_33696": "[[What will I find in the book?]] What can I expect to find in the book?",
  "playerfemale_33698": "A simple stone. This must be for me.",
  "playerfemale_33699": "Sebastian – ",
  "playerfemale_33703": "[[Everyone should know that curse.]] He did attack us. You had no choice.",
  "playerfemale_33704": "[[No one should know that curse.]] You went too far, Sebastian.",
  "playerfemale_33705": "Sebastian – wait.",
  "playerfemale_33706": "Stop, Sebastian. Hold on.",
  "playerfemale_33712": "[[She seemed genuinely worried.]] She mentioned Dark Magic and even the Ashwinders.",
  "playerfemale_33713": "[[She seemed to be overreacting.]] She mentioned Dark Magic and the Ashwinders. Has her imagination got the best of her?",
  "playerfemale_33714": "Sebastian – over here.",
  "playerfemale_33715": "I said I'm taking responsibility, Sebastian. Do you want the relic or not?",
  "playerfemale_33716": "I should see this through and find the Hufflepuff house chest.",
  "playerfemale_33717": "I should see this through and find the Ravenclaw house chest.",

  "playerfemale_33719": "Silvanus Selwyn?",
  "playerfemale_33720": "Victor Rookwood is dead. He confronted me as I left Ollivanders with the Keepers' wand. I had to defend myself.",
  "playerfemale_33721": "I should hope that the enchantments protecting the castle would protect against an incursion from below.",
  "playerfemale_33722": "I should imagine so.",
  "playerfemale_33724": "Were you able to reach Professor Weasley?",
  "playerfemale_33725": "I wonder if Ranrok is here.",
  "playerfemale_33726": "You and I have faced worse, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_33728": "You will not take what is not yours!",
  "playerfemale_33729": "This drill stands between us and him. We need to move it.",
  "playerfemale_33730": "That sounds like trouble.",
  "playerfemale_33732": "You're no match for us.",
  "playerfemale_33733": "Another troll! Where are the other professors?",
  "playerfemale_33734": "Professor! That wall – that's the way forward!",
  "playerfemale_33735": "I fear you're right, Professor. There's nothing we can do but keep searching.",
  "playerfemale_33736": "What could be taking the other professors so long to get here?",
  "playerfemale_33737": "I hope you're right.",
  "playerfemale_33738": "We can use those against them.",
  "playerfemale_33739": "You'll never find what Ranrok wants.",
  "playerfemale_33740": "We'll show these beasts who's in charge.",
  "playerfemale_33741": "Look out. Another troll. This one's worse than the last two.",
  "playerfemale_33742": "We made it.",
  "playerfemale_33743": "I can't believe this is it. The repository has been under the castle for hundreds of years.",
  "playerfemale_33744": "Your timing couldn't be better, Professor Hecat.",
  "playerfemale_33745": "We couldn't be happier to see you, Professor Sharp.",
  "playerfemale_33748": "Let's see how you like it.",
  "playerfemale_33749": "Two can play at this game.",
  "playerfemale_33750": "How about a taste of your own power?",
  "playerfemale_33751": "Where did those come from?",
  "playerfemale_33752": "You won't get away from me that easily.",
  "playerfemale_33753": "You can't stop me.",
  "playerfemale_33755": "Ranrok, if you can hear me, your end is coming.",
  "playerfemale_33757": "How long are you going to keep up this charade?",
  "playerfemale_33758": "I need to avoid those.",
  "playerfemale_33759": "You can't run forever, Ranrok.",
  "playerfemale_33761": "You can't stop me, dragon.",
  "playerfemale_33762": "Ha! Don't like that very much, do you?",
  "playerfemale_33763": "I have you on the run, but you can't escape.",
  "playerfemale_33764": "This ends here, Ranrok!",
  "playerfemale_33765": "It's tearing this place apart.",
  "playerfemale_33766": "I need to steal its magic.",
  "playerfemale_33767": "Almost there.",
  "playerfemale_33769": "Why do you think you'll find a cure in the Restricted Section? Does the Hogwarts matron have nothing that can help Anne?",
  "playerfemale_33780": "I can.",
  "playerfemale_33785": "Will I be able to weave even more powerful magic into my clothing with the loom?",
  "playerfemale_33786": "The white one! It's her.",
  "playerfemale_33787": "Ah-ha! Found you.",
  "playerfemale_33788": "Bones outside a sarcophagus. Seems – odd.",
  "playerfemale_33789": "What do I need to do, Deek?",
  "playerfemale_33796": "Sebastian, we need to go.",
  "playerfemale_33797": "Sebastian – a journal entry! We should look for more.",
  "playerfemale_33801": "Sebastian –",
  "playerfemale_33802": "Ominis – ",
  "playerfemale_33818": "[[We should turn Sebastian in.]] We don't have a choice. You're right. You were right the entire time.",
  "playerfemale_33819": "[[We must not turn Sebastian in.]] We do have a choice. What good will it do to turn him in now?",
  "playerfemale_33828": "Understood.",
  "playerfemale_33849": "It is.",
  "playerfemale_33851": "[[What have you heard about Ranrok and Rookwood?]] Have you heard what Ranrok and Rookwood are working on together?",
  "playerfemale_33852": "[[Are you worried about Rookwood?]] You seemed unfazed by Rookwood and Harlow the other day. They don't scare you?",
  "playerfemale_33853": "But you're friends now?",
  "playerfemale_33854": "Might I ask you some questions, Sirona?",
  "playerfemale_33857": "Surely this changes things. Ranrok has Bragbor's journals and knows where the final repository is.",
  "playerfemale_33858": "Poachers! Garnuff was right, then. I'd better be careful.",
  "playerfemale_33863": "I retrieved a stolen helm that he hopes to return to Ranrok in order to regain his confidence.",
  "playerfemale_33864": "Another Pensieve.",
  "playerfemale_33865": "I wonder –",
  "playerfemale_33866": "Let's find out.",
  "playerfemale_33869": "[[It was terrifying for both of us.]] If it weren't for me, I suspect those poachers would have flayed her alive.",
  "playerfemale_33870": "[[We are both fine.]] Biscuit is fine, as am I. I was able to rescue her without much incident.",
  "playerfemale_33871": "[[I'm sure she'll be glad to be home.]] I'm glad she's safe now. I'm sure she'll be happy to go home.",
  "playerfemale_33872": "[[I'd like to be compensated for my efforts.]] You can have her back – for the right price.",
  "playerfemale_33873": "That's it for the poachers. Now to find Biscuit.",
  "playerfemale_33874": "All right, Biscuit. Let's get you back to Garnuff, shall we?",
  "playerfemale_33875": "She's all right. She said she was going to rest.",
  "playerfemale_33876": "This is my chance. I'm coming, Niamh.",
  "playerfemale_33877": "I'd best move while I can. Niamh must be here somewhere.",
  "playerfemale_33878": "I see. A staircase straight ahead.",
  "playerfemale_33879": "Death.",
  "playerfemale_33880": "A ladder. Perhaps they won't be able to find me if I go up there.",
  "playerfemale_33881": "Too many. I must cross this road as fast as I can.",
  "playerfemale_33882": "That doorway looks like the only safe way forward.",
  "playerfemale_33883": "Nothing this way but more danger. There must be another way to find you.",
  "playerfemale_33887": "I've seen Thestrals before, but where would I find a pair of them nearby?",
  "playerfemale_33888": "Perhaps that helm will yield some answers.",
  "playerfemale_33890": "This may have been a bad idea.",
  "playerfemale_33891": "<i>Incendio!</i>",
  "playerfemale_33892": "This way!",
  "playerfemale_33893": "I'm guessing the egg we have belongs to that dragon –",
  "playerfemale_33894": "Miss Willardsey, could you remind me what it is that you needed?",
  "playerfemale_33895": "Rookwood Castle?",
  "playerfemale_33899": "Let's get into that castle.",
  "playerfemale_33901": "– and have broken open some sort of container.",
  "playerfemale_33902": "[[I'm ready.]] Just tell me where I need to go.",
  "playerfemale_33903": "[[I deserve to know more first.]] Sir, surely I've proven myself. In light of what's happened, perhaps you should tell me everything now.",
  "playerfemale_33917": "Sebastian –",
  "playerfemale_33918": "Sebastian – we're ready.",
  "playerfemale_33919": "Ominis and I found a compromise.",
  "playerfemale_33920": "I told him we ought to give you this chance – that the relic is too important to ignore.",
  "playerfemale_33921": "You need the relic.",
  "playerfemale_33922": "Ominis and I agreed. Surely there's a difference between casting <i>Imperio</i> on someone without their knowledge and casting it with permission.",
  "playerfemale_33923": "I've taken full responsibility. You have my word.",
  "playerfemale_33924": "The curse is lifted already. He'll easily find his way out of the catacomb, just as we did.",
  "playerfemale_33925": "He was troubled, Sebastian. Even though we agreed to it all, it's been a lot to take in.",
  "playerfemale_33926": "Very well. Let me know when and I'll meet you.",
  "playerfemale_33927": "Why is it off limits?",
  "playerfemale_33928": "Hence the name.",
  "playerfemale_33929": "Nothing gets past you.",
  "playerfemale_33930": "He'll be all right, Sebastian.",
  "playerfemale_33931": "And yes. It is. As I'm sure you suspect, there is a bit more to all of this.",
  "playerfemale_33933": "And, sir – there's something else. Lodgok knew Miriam.",
  "playerfemale_33934": "I – I don't know.",
  "playerfemale_33935": "Why did the Keepers want to keep Isidora quiet? Why destroy her portrait?",
  "playerfemale_33941": "I – certainly hope that's a good thing.",
  "playerfemale_33942": "I couldn't stand there and watch them harm the poor thing.",
  "playerfemale_33955": "[[No need for threats.]] You needn't threaten me. I'm not going to say anything about your 'Undercroft.'",
  "playerfemale_33956": "[[No need for threats.]] You needn't threaten me. I'm not going to say anything about your 'Undercroft.'",
  "playerfemale_33957": "Please! I was trying to defend him. He was clear that this was a secret place and I was to tell no one. He's a good friend.",
  "playerfemale_33958": "And Sebastian is a good friend. You shouldn't immediately assume the worst of him.",
  "playerfemale_33959": "Ominis, I just meant –",
  "playerfemale_33960": "[[I promise not to say anything.]] Trust me, Ominis. I won't say a word.",
  "playerfemale_33961": "[[I promise not to say anything.]] Trust me, Ominis. I won't say a word.",
  "playerfemale_33962": "[[She was brilliant!]] I thought she was brilliant. Can't believe you introduced me to her.",
  "playerfemale_33963": "Professor Howin mentioned the poachers as well. She seemed to imply that we couldn't rely on the Ministry to help.",
  "playerfemale_33964": "[[That hardly sounds incriminating.]] You may be reading into it. Talking to people isn't a crime.",
  "playerfemale_33965": "[[That sounds suspicious.]] That does seem strange. Sounds as if they're planning something.",
  "playerfemale_33966": "How exactly did you and Highwing cross paths?",
  "playerfemale_33968": "Surely the poachers can be brought to justice by someone – the Ministry, perhaps.",
  "playerfemale_33969": "[[I wouldn't. Poachers are dangerous.]] I'm not sure that's such a good idea. The poachers seem a dangerous lot.",
  "playerfemale_33970": "[[Would be good to investigate.]] I think that's a fine idea. Information is power.",
  "playerfemale_33971": "You seem undeterred. Will you let me know what you find out?",
  "playerfemale_33972": "Considering the bones, I'll assume this is a tomb.",
  "playerfemale_33975": "I did. And because Jackdaw had followed the map they contained, when I found the pages, I found the location on the map.",
  "playerfemale_33976": "Believe it or not, it's a room below Hogwarts.",
  "playerfemale_33977": "I was hoping you'd say that. Oh, and we'll need to bring the book.",
  "playerfemale_33978": "I have, Professor – Rookwood.",
  "playerfemale_33983": "Before the witch from the last Pensieve – Isidora – became a Hogwarts professor, she argued with Professor Rackham about using magic to remove pain.",
  "playerfemale_33984": "And this is my mentor, Professor Fig.",
  "playerfemale_33985": "Let's go.",
  "playerfemale_33986": "I don't think so.",
  "playerfemale_33987": "Ranrok is working with Rookwood?",
  "playerfemale_33988": "[[I do.]] You and your friend Charles spoke of the Portkey – and of trials you'd created for one who could see traces of ancient magic.",
  "playerfemale_33989": "His search?",
  "playerfemale_33990": "These pots and cauldrons haven't moved in ages.",
  "playerfemale_33991": "We did not, Professor. We encountered goblins outside the tower.",
  "playerfemale_33992": "[[I believe I have.]] It looks familiar. Perhaps your 'young friend' is more well-travelled than you might think.",
  "playerfemale_33993": "[[It doesn't look familiar.]] I don't think I have. Perhaps your 'young friend' is not as well-travelled as you think.",
  "playerfemale_33994": "[[Of course.]] I understand. I'll see what I can learn about the missing pages while you're gone.",
  "playerfemale_33995": "Very well. Are you able to tell me anything about the next trial?",
  "playerfemale_33997": "[[It was easy.]] You weren't much of a challenge.",
  "playerfemale_33998": "[[She sounds fascinating.]] How interesting. I'm amazed I've never heard of her.",
  "playerfemale_33999": "[[Doesn't sound that impressive.]] She was just good at casting a spell? No wonder I've never heard of her.",
  "playerfemale_34000": "And you're a third-year, so –",
  "playerfemale_34001": "I think he simply wants to show me something that involves Gobbledegook. If it helps, he's a friend of Sirona's.",
  "playerfemale_34002": "[[But you had no choice.]] How else did he expect goblinkind to get the helmet back? Seems he has no interest in making amends with you.",
  "playerfemale_34003": "[[You should have expected that.]] You said this would repair the 'chasm' between the two of you. How did you not expect him to react this way?",
  "playerfemale_34005": "If you share Ranrok’s views, then why are you helping me?",
  "playerfemale_34017": "Miriam.",
  "playerfemale_34018": "Professor Fig’s wife. He told me of her research – and I know of the container.",
  "playerfemale_34019": "You think Ranrok murdered her.",
  "playerfemale_34020": "Thank you, Lodgok. For telling me this.",
  "playerfemale_34021": "[[I suppose so.]] Of course. I look forward to playing against you.",
  "playerfemale_34022": "[[Surely you've better things to do.]] Shouldn't you be preparing for your next class, or helping a student?",
  "playerfemale_34023": "[[You taught me well.]] I had a good teacher.",
  "playerfemale_34024": "That's the last of Zenobia's Gobstones. I should go and see her.",
  "playerfemale_34030": "She was. And she pulled emotions – as she did from her father – from Professor Fitzgerald. Without permission.",
  "playerfemale_34031": "What's more, she said that she found a way to store the traces of magic she extracted – in goblin silver.",
  "playerfemale_34032": "Lodgok – Lodgok and Ranrok were brothers. Lodgok was bringing the journal to me.",
  "playerfemale_34035": "Very well.",
  "playerfemale_34042": "[[I cannot say.]] I'm afraid I can't say. I didn't read the journals.",
  "playerfemale_34043": "[[Isidora told him.]] Isidora told Bragbor about the magic when she asked him to build a container for her. I've seen her memories.",
  "playerfemale_34048": "I'm ready to finish Harlow once and for all. What is your plan?",
  "playerfemale_34056": "I'm eager to try it out.",
  "playerfemale_34057": "That sounds wonderful, Mr Ollivander.",
  "playerfemale_34058": "What am I to do with the artefacts, Professor Rackham?",
  "playerfemale_34059": "Then I must go now and craft this wand. Perhaps Mr Ollivander will help me.",
  "playerfemale_34062": "We are. And we were glad to help.",
  "playerfemale_34072": "I need to reposition that pillar to climb out of here. Perhaps the archway is the answer.",
  "playerfemale_34073": "Perhaps I can only move objects while I'm on the other side of the archway.",
  "playerfemale_34074": "I need to reposition the pillar whilst on one side of the archway, so that I can climb it on the other side of the archway.",
  "playerfemale_34075": "That pillar is blocking the path. I'll need to move it.",
  "playerfemale_34076": "Is there any way to reposition this archway?",
  "playerfemale_34077": "If I arrange the archway correctly, I should be able to move the pillar and clear the path.",
  "playerfemale_34078": "I believe I need to proceed to the left here, but how?",
  "playerfemale_34079": "Perhaps I'm to hit the mark on the far wall. That sort of thing has repositioned the archways in the past.",
  "playerfemale_34080": "The bridges appear and disappear, depending upon which side of the archway I'm on.",
  "playerfemale_34081": "There's a pillar here, but no ledge near it for me to grab onto.",
  "playerfemale_34082": "Hitting those marks readjusts the archways. Perhaps there's a way forward from the other side of this one.",
  "playerfemale_34083": "Is it possible to pull one of those blocks through the archway?",
  "playerfemale_34084": "After pulling the block out through the archway, I can place it where it can be climbed on while on the other side of the archway.",
  "playerfemale_34101": "Highwing's fine. I'm keeping an eye on her. She's safe, Poppy. I promise.",
  "playerfemale_34103": "[[I'll bring the book here.]] Very well. I'll retrieve the book right away.",
  "playerfemale_34104": "[[Why is this called the Map Chamber?]] I'm a bit confused, sir. Why is this room called the 'Map Chamber'?",
  "playerfemale_34105": "[[Are you a Seer?]] The statues and carvings in the house on the cliffside – those are of you. Are you a Seer?",
  "playerfemale_34106": "[[Can you tell me more about this place?]] What more can you tell me about this place, Professor Rackham?",
  "playerfemale_34110": "Wait – is the next trial in the Headmaster's office?",
  "playerfemale_34111": "Are you all right, Anne? I didn't mean to intrude.",
  "playerfemale_34114": "[[Any rumours going around town?]] Any whisperings of anything going about the town?",
  "playerfemale_34116": "Otto Dibble works at Gladrags. I should check there.",
  "playerfemale_34118": "You said you had news about the poachers – and that some of it had to do with me.",
  "playerfemale_34123": "Only one way to find out.",
  "playerfemale_34124": "They don't scare me. I want to see whatever it is you need to show me.",
  "playerfemale_34128": "Sebastian! I've seen this before. This house, the well, the view.",
  "playerfemale_34129": "This well looks familiar.",
  "playerfemale_34130": "I found a Pensieve that day in the Restricted Section – with a memory that showed this house. There was a little girl, and a drought –",
  "playerfemale_34131": "– the Keepers have shown me other memories as well. The girl became a Hogwarts professor. Her name was Isidora Morganach. She was one of the Keepers.",
  "playerfemale_34137": "Sebastian – this house did belong to a Hogwarts professor. Hundreds of years ago!",
  "playerfemale_34144": "I can't be sure, of course. But I don't think so. I didn't see any traces of it around your sister.",
  "playerfemale_34146": "Sebastian – it's been a while.",
  "playerfemale_34154": "I don't know. But Fig and I think that Ranrok has somehow found a way to harness that magic's power.",
  "playerfemale_34155": "That's what we're trying to find out.",
  "playerfemale_34164": "Absolutely, sir.",
  "playerfemale_34165": "We aren't involved with them. If anything, we want to see them stopped.",
  "playerfemale_34166": "Please, we don't want any trouble. We're simply passing through.",
  "playerfemale_34168": "Not a fair one, though. Not with her chained up like that.",
  "playerfemale_34169": "<i>Revelio</i>?",
  "playerfemale_34170": "Professor Fig says I have a rare connection to a powerful form of ancient magic.",
  "playerfemale_34171": "I think so. I'm still learning. But I can see traces of it, and I've cast magic I can't otherwise explain.",
  "playerfemale_34172": "I'm still learning. But I can see traces of it, and I've cast magic I can't otherwise explain.",
  "playerfemale_34173": "I know that's a lot to absorb.",
  "playerfemale_34178": "What do you mean, 'earn' our way out? Do you think this is some sort of test?",
  "playerfemale_34179": "That glow again. But – on the floor.",
  "playerfemale_34180": "That statue –",
  "playerfemale_34181": "I see some sort of statue, but only as a reflection in the floor.",
  "playerfemale_34182": "Professor Fig?",
  "playerfemale_34184": "Hello?",
  "playerfemale_34185": "[[I don't recall it fully.]] I do recall seeing the memory, but I don't remember all of the details.",
  "playerfemale_34186": "You too, Amit.",
  "playerfemale_34191": "Still smoking. They can't have been gone long.",
  "playerfemale_34192": "Why wouldn't they take their cages with them when they left?",
  "playerfemale_34193": "Pelts. Poor beasts.",
  "playerfemale_34194": "Into the Forbidden Forest for Bubotubers? I hope it's worth the risk.",
  "playerfemale_34195": "That smells awful. Only four more, thank goodness.",
  "playerfemale_34196": "Just my luck – a troll.",
  "playerfemale_34197": "Now to see if Herodiana Byrne was as good as Sophronia said she was.",
  "playerfemale_34198": "I see. The switch reset everything. Good to know.",
  "playerfemale_34199": "That's the last of them. Seems I was a match for Herodiana Byrne after all.",
  "playerfemale_34204": "How's your Gran doing, by the way?",
  "playerfemale_34205": "Surely she'll be pleased you've gone after the Snidgets.",
  "playerfemale_34206": "Ashwinders! I'd better find a way around them. Or perhaps through them –",
  "playerfemale_34207": "That's the last of them. For now.",
  "playerfemale_34208": "Now then. Which one of you is Biscuit?",
  "playerfemale_34210": "Poachers. I need to be careful.",
  "playerfemale_34211": "Miss Willardsey will never believe where the butterflies led me.",
  "playerfemale_34212": "What do you mean you'd 'had enough' and 'the worst was over?'",
  "playerfemale_34213": "So this is the infamous Absconder.",
  "playerfemale_34214": "Doesn't look like anyone's been down here in ages. Best keep moving.",
  "playerfemale_34215": "That did the trick.",

  "playerfemale_34219": "I'd like to ask you about your shop, if you don't mind.",
  "playerfemale_34221": "I can't believe it. Rookwood's reign is finally over. I'll need to send an owl to Natty right away.",
  "playerfemale_34222": "Let's make them count.",
  "playerfemale_34223": "Impressive. Especially with how little information he gave us.",
  "playerfemale_34225": "[[Let's poke around this mystery cave.]] Well, we're here. We might as well have a look.",
  "playerfemale_34227": "[[Why do people avoid the cave?]] Did you discover why people avoid this cave?",
  "playerfemale_34233": "The wisps of magic seem to be leading me somewhere.",

  "playerfemale_34236": "Did you need something, Poppy?",
  "playerfemale_34237": "Well done, Poppy. This did end up being the right cave after all.",
  "playerfemale_34239": "I'll know it when I see it.",
  "playerfemale_34240": "I've seen a wall like this before. It must be the way back.",
  "playerfemale_34241": "[[What will you tell them?]] What will you tell them about Mr Osric's death?",
  "playerfemale_34244": "[[That would be unwise.]] I should think you'd have better things to do with your time. Ahem. Now where's my elf?",
  "playerfemale_34245": "[[What exactly is Defence Against the Dark Arts?]] Can you tell me more about the Defence Against the Dark Arts class?",
  "playerfemale_34246": "[[What's Hogsmeade?]] You mentioned 'Hogsmeade,' Professor?",
  "playerfemale_34247": "[[Can you tell me more about Charms class?]] What will I learn in Charms class?",
  "playerfemale_34248": "[[Thank you, Professor.]] Thank you, Professor Weasley.",

  "playerfemale_34252": "Where can I find Jackdaw's head?",
  "playerfemale_34253": "[[What are the rules?]] Please could you explain the rules again?",
  "playerfemale_34255": "<i>Revelio</i> could be useful here.",
  "playerfemale_34257": "I have to believe that only a Slytherin would have been ambitious enough to get this far.",
  "playerfemale_34258": "I have to believe that only a Hufflepuff would have had the tenacity to get this far.",
  "playerfemale_34259": "I have to believe that only a Gryffindor would have had the courage to get this far.",
  "playerfemale_34260": "I have to believe that only a Ravenclaw would have had the intelligence to get this far.",
  "playerfemale_34261": "I wonder when Professor Fig will be back. I did promise him I wouldn't neglect my studies while he was away.",
  "playerfemale_34262": "My spells are having no effect on the dragon.",
  "playerfemale_34263": "It's feeding off the power from the repository.",
  "playerfemale_34264": "Aside from the birdbath, anything else I should look for?",
  "playerfemale_34265": "You've been very helpful. Thank you.",
  "playerfemale_34267": "Here it is. The map that brought your doom, Jackdaw. Hmm. Is there something beyond this room?",
  "playerfemale_34271": "Yes, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_34272": "This will be incredibly helpful. Thank you.",
  "playerfemale_34277": "<i>Expelliarmus</i> ought to disarm you brutes.",
  "playerfemale_34283": "An Unlocking Charm?",
  "playerfemale_34284": "It's locked.",
  "playerfemale_34285": "Well, this isn't ideal.",
  "playerfemale_34286": "Professor?",
  "playerfemale_34288": "Not that I recall. What are they?",
  "playerfemale_34290": "Impressive workmanship aside, it's the only way forward.",
  "playerfemale_34291": "Not an entanglement we need right now.",
  "playerfemale_34292": "Are these repositories like the broken container I found at Rookwood Castle?",
  "playerfemale_34293": "It's Hogwarts.",
  "playerfemale_34294": "Let's take a closer look.",
  "playerfemale_34295": "You're good.",
  "playerfemale_34296": "Let's just say I'm a quick learner.",
  "playerfemale_34297": "Understood, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_34301": "Thank you, Professor.",

  "playerfemale_34303": "[[What? More work?]] I'm not sure I have time for extra assignments, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_34304": "Lodgok's getting himself into more danger than he realises. I'd better find him.",
  "playerfemale_34305": "Ranrok is here. I only hope Lodgok doesn't cross paths with him.",
  "playerfemale_34306": "I can end this right now. I have to destroy the drill and stop Ranrok's Loyalists.",
  "playerfemale_34307": "I hope I can get to Ranrok before Lodgok does.",
  "playerfemale_34308": "Poor Lodgok. Dead by his brother's hand. No wonder he tried so hard to reason with him.",
  "playerfemale_34309": "I'll send word to Fig to meet me in the Map Chamber. He and the Keepers need to know Ranrok has that journal and knows where the final repository is.",
  "playerfemale_34310": "Thank you, Professor. I enjoyed the match.",
  "playerfemale_34311": "Of course, Professor. It was a challenging match.",
  "playerfemale_34312": "Thank you, Sebastian. I'll keep that in mind.",
  "playerfemale_34314": "Sir – the trolls were wearing armour. It had that dark glow, like the dragon collar.",
  "playerfemale_34315": "Shall we go?",
  "playerfemale_34317": "Sebastian mentioned sneaking into the Restricted Section. Perhaps he'll have an idea.",
  "playerfemale_34318": "Where does this one lead? Off the beaten path I suspect.",
  "playerfemale_34319": "No sign of Lodgok out here. He must be inside already.",
  "playerfemale_34320": "How am I being protected? What sort of magic is this?",
  "playerfemale_34321": "We're not alone?",
  "playerfemale_34322": "I'm a student at Hogwarts, sir. And this is Professor Fig.",
  "playerfemale_34323": "I received your owl. I was able to speak with Lodgok – the goblin I mentioned before.",
  "playerfemale_34324": "[[I do.]] I believe he's trustworthy, yes. He seemed sincere. And Sirona Ryan trusts him.",
  "playerfemale_34325": "[[Difficult to say.]] He seemed trustworthy. Difficult to know really. But, Sirona Ryan trusts him.",
  "playerfemale_34326": "Fair enough. In fact, the book was below the Restricted Section, as it appeared on the map.",
  "playerfemale_34327": "It was a book we were after.",
  "playerfemale_34328": "I think I know, sir. I saw two more memories where I found the book.",
  "playerfemale_34329": "The first memory showed him and three other professors using ancient magic to restore a hamlet from a drought.",
  "playerfemale_34330": "They were talking to a student who started as a fifth-year – like I did. She could see traces of magic too.",
  "playerfemale_34332": "[[I'd love to hear about it.]] I'd love to hear about how you and Highwing met.",
  "playerfemale_34333": "[[You seem hesitant. You needn't tell me.]] If you don't want to talk about it, we don't have to.",
  "playerfemale_34334": "[[Do you worry about being recognised by the poachers?]] We were around so many poachers in the tent. Were you not worried about being recognised?",
  "playerfemale_34335": "You've seen this before?",
  "playerfemale_34336": "Is the pattern they left behind on the ground – normal?",
  "playerfemale_34337": "Could this actually be where the Snidgets are hidden?",
  "playerfemale_34338": "I'm ready if you are.",
  "playerfemale_34339": "You knew the poachers would try and kill Poppy and me?",
  "playerfemale_34340": "I don't suppose you'd like to start from the beginning. I think Poppy and I could use that.",
  "playerfemale_34347": "Thank you, Professor. I shall keep this second artefact safe, as you've advised.",
  "playerfemale_34348": "[[I'm ready.]] I'm ready for whatever comes next.",
  "playerfemale_34350": "[[What did Isidora remove from her father's chest in the memory?]] What was the glowing strand that Isidora pulled from her father's chest?",
  "playerfemale_34355": "Thank you, Professor. It's a pleasure to meet you as well.",
  "playerfemale_34357": "[[Who is Priya?]] You mentioned someone named Priya?",
  "playerfemale_34358": "It's you.",
  "playerfemale_34360": "A house-elf named Scrope sent me. Said I might find a Black family ring here.",
  "playerfemale_34361": "Understandable. We did sabotage their fighting ring and steal a dragon egg from them.",
  "playerfemale_34362": "Unless what?",
  "playerfemale_34363": "I didn't keep you waiting, did I?",
  "playerfemale_34364": "[[You said you had news about the dragon.]] What did you find out about the dragon you were tracking?",
  "playerfemale_34365": "[[What was your Gran sending you?]] What was she sending you?",
  "playerfemale_34366": "[[What's your Gran researching?]] What kind of research is she doing?",
  "playerfemale_34368": "Unless what?",
  "playerfemale_34369": "There you are. You were in such a state when you left.",
  "playerfemale_34370": "What do you mean? Is she all right?",
  "playerfemale_34371": "What do you mean?",
  "playerfemale_34373": "There might be something here worth a closer look.",
  "playerfemale_34374": "A journal entry of Isidora's. I should hold on to this.",
  "playerfemale_34375": "I ought to look around before using the passageway.",
  "playerfemale_34379": "And I still have that rune symbol we found on the triptych. If there is a connection, I suspect we'll see that symbol again.",
  "playerfemale_34384": "We should wait.",
  "playerfemale_34386": "All this time, we've been a step behind Ranrok. I may know someone who could help us get ahead.",
  "playerfemale_34390": "Sebastian, that relic you mentioned –",
  "playerfemale_34394": "Suppose I have enough to distract myself with till he returns with the book.",
  "playerfemale_34395": "Did you know that I would be here?",
  "playerfemale_34399": "She was unnerved by Isidora's use of ancient magic. But I still can't be sure how any of it connects to Ranrok.",
  "playerfemale_34400": "I understand. Thank you, sir.",
  "playerfemale_34401": "I was thinking about needing a place away from prying eyes. Brilliant.",
  "playerfemale_34403": "What I need specifically is a place where I can catch up on my schoolwork without distraction.",
  "playerfemale_34405": "I see. Can I regain resources by vanishing something I've already conjured?",

  "playerfemale_34432": "[[That could be fun.]] A quiz sounds like fun.",
  "playerfemale_34433": "[[If I must.]] If that's the only way I can convince you to give me that book then let's get it over with.",
  "playerfemale_34435": "You wanted to discuss my progress so far this term, Professor?",
  "playerfemale_34442": "I realise it's a lot to take in.  I'm not even sure I understand it all yet. And, no, not like Quidditch.",
  "playerfemale_34444": "There! I saw something.",

  "playerfemale_34643": "But why would he think that we had anything to do with poachers?",
  "playerfemale_34644": "He was certainly a charmer.",
  "playerfemale_34647": "I'm all right at the moment.",
  "playerfemale_34648": "All right. But how?",
  "playerfemale_34652": "The bridge Jackdaw mentioned. I must be going the right way.",
  "playerfemale_34653": "The waterfall. For a thief, Jackdaw's surprisingly as good as his word.",
  "playerfemale_34654": "Something oddly solemn about this place. Such regal creatures, stags.",
  "playerfemale_34655": "No risk those Loyalists will report back to Ranrok now. Let's see where Jackdaw has led me.",
  "playerfemale_34656": "[[Thank you for your insights.]] Thank you, Professor. I look forward to stargazing.",
  "playerfemale_34657": "Oh, no. Not this close to the school, Amit.",
  "playerfemale_34658": "A few cobwebs and some dust. Nothing to be concerned about.",
  "playerfemale_34659": "Nothing to do now but keep going.",
  "playerfemale_34660": "Are you certain you don't want to come the rest of the way?",
  "playerfemale_34661": "Hello Grace, can I help you?",
  "playerfemale_34662": "There's something back there, beyond the wall. How do I get back there?",
  "playerfemale_34663": "Whatever Jackdaw left for Anne must be back there, beyond this wall.",
  "playerfemale_34664": "A note from Jackdaw. Anne never found it. So how did he die? Was she to blame at all?",
  "playerfemale_34665": "The Richard Jackdaw? I heard you disappeared years ago. You have some explaining to do.",
  "playerfemale_34666": "Those candles must be important.",
  "playerfemale_34667": "I see. There must be something to the arrangement of the candles.",
  "playerfemale_34668": "The candles correspond to the handles I'm to pull in order to open the way forward. <i>Accio</i> should do the trick.",
  "playerfemale_34669": "[[I'll keep looking.]] Understood. I shall keep an eye out.",
  "playerfemale_34670": "[[How many statues are there?]] How many statues are there to find?",
  "playerfemale_34671": "[[What will I get for helping you further?]] You mentioned offering something in exchange for my assistance.",
  "playerfemale_34674": "[[You don't suppose Harlow took him?]] I don't mean to be grim, but – could Harlow have taken him?",
  "playerfemale_34675": "[[I'm sure your son is fine.]] He must be around here somewhere. When did you last see him?",
  "playerfemale_34676": "Do you know which way Archie might have gone?",
  "playerfemale_34678": "[[We'll find your son.]] We'll find your son, Mrs Bickle.",
  "playerfemale_34679": "Archie's satchel! Why would he leave it behind?",
  "playerfemale_34683": "What did Officer Singer say about the letter you brought her?",
  "playerfemale_34686": "I managed to rescue a Puffskein.",
  "playerfemale_34687": "I rescued a Jobberknoll.",
  "playerfemale_34688": "It was a bit trickier than the others, but I have a Mooncalf now.",
  "playerfemale_34689": "I imagine the Desk of Description will come in handy.",
  "playerfemale_34690": "Hello, Scrope. Thanks to you, I was able to enter Apollonia's grotto. The toast was the key.",
  "playerfemale_34691": "I met a ghost there – Richard Jackdaw – who's agreed to lead me to the pages I've been looking for.",
  "playerfemale_34692": "Your mother sent us to find you.",
  "playerfemale_34693": "We're so sorry, Archie. We won't let him get away with it. But first we need to get you home to your mother.",
  "playerfemale_34694": "We wouldn't have it any other way, Archie. Now, let's get you home. We know a safe way back.",
  "playerfemale_34695": "Your husband's friends may be in danger?",
  "playerfemale_34696": "How can we help?",
  "playerfemale_34697": "I'm sorry again about your husband, Mrs Bickle.",
  "playerfemale_34698": "[[He's already after us.]] It may be too late for that. I'm afraid Harlow's already after us.",
  "playerfemale_34699": "[[Understood.]] We don't want to worry you.",
  "playerfemale_34701": "There is. I've seen symbols like these before. I need to find all of them – then cast at them quickly in succession.",
  "playerfemale_34704": "What was it you needed me to do, Scrope?",
  "playerfemale_34705": "Wait, Professor. The name 'Rookwood'. Do you think –",
  "playerfemale_34706": "What is this?",
  "playerfemale_34707": "The vaults seem to go on forever.",
  "playerfemale_34708": "Hello Lenora. Could you remind me what's so special about that empty painting?",
  "playerfemale_34709": "That wasn't so bad, was it?",
  "playerfemale_34710": "Thank you, Amit. I couldn't have done it without you. Now if you don't mind, I'd like to have a word with Lodgok.",
  "playerfemale_34711": "They're building enormous drills. We found their plans. Ranrok must be searching for the repositories.",
  "playerfemale_34712": "I'm glad you came with me, Amit. Now that we know what they're up to, we can get out of here.",
  "playerfemale_34713": "I'll get us through here safely, Amit. You have my word.",
  "playerfemale_34714": "Stay close. I've handled much worse.",
  "playerfemale_34715": "That should be the last of them, Amit.",
  "playerfemale_34716": "There must be a quicker way out of here than retracing our steps.",
  "playerfemale_34717": "We're almost out of here, Amit. Look – the lift!",
  "playerfemale_34718": "She called you her 'little gazelle'. Is that a term of endearment where you're from?",
  "playerfemale_34719": "[[Perhaps your mother is right.]] She's concerned for your safety. It may be best for you to stay away from Hogsmeade for now.",
  "playerfemale_34720": "[[We can't allow your mother to stop us.]] We're making good progress. We can't quit now.",
  "playerfemale_34721": "[[I'll complete the tasks.]] I'll start on the task right away, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_34722": "[[What is the purpose of the tasks?]] Why must I first complete tasks to learn <i>Reparo</i>?",
  "playerfemale_34723": "This is the right area. I wonder where the flying page is.",
  "playerfemale_34724": "A flying page must be around here somewhere.",
  "playerfemale_34725": "Seems Crossed Wands isn't as secret as it's believed to be.",
  "playerfemale_34726": "I got here as soon as I could.",
  "playerfemale_34727": "What's going on here?",
  "playerfemale_34729": "[[I intend to open it.]] I have decided to open the repository. Its power cannot lie dormant for centuries more.",
  "playerfemale_34730": "[[I intend to keep it contained here.]] I plan to keep the repository as it is.",
  "playerfemale_34731": "[[This power should not be kept from the world.]] Isidora knew she had a remarkable power to help people. I intend to use my ability to finish her work. Build upon it.",
  "playerfemale_34732": "[[I want the power for myself.]] Isidora wasted her ability trying to save people from themselves. I will not let others dictate what I do with this – my – power.",
  "playerfemale_34733": "[[I shall keep it secret forever.]] The Keepers were right. The risk of using this magic is too dangerous. It is my responsibility alone to keep it safe.",
  "playerfemale_34734": "[[I shall keep it secret for now.]] I plan to keep it secret for now. But in time, when I am ready, I plan to tell those I trust everything – and accept their help.",
  "playerfemale_34737": "The dragon that attacked my carriage was wearing a collar. And Professor Fig was genuinely baffled by its behaviour.",
  "playerfemale_34739": "[[It's to do with Ranrok.]] Rookwood is working with Ranrok. And Ranrok is after something I found at Gringotts.",
  "playerfemale_34740": "[[I'd rather not say at present.]] If it's all right with you, I'd rather not say. At least not at the moment.",
  "playerfemale_34743": "[[I'm so sorry, Poppy.]] I'm sorry, Poppy. I'm glad she's all right. I don't think either one of us could have anticipated that.",
  "playerfemale_34744": "[[What's a Snidget?]] Exactly what kind of creature is a Snidget?",
  "playerfemale_34751": "[[Did the journal say where the Snidgets were hidden?]] Where exactly are these Snidgets allegedly hidden?",
  "playerfemale_34752": "[[Why do the poachers care about Snidgets?]] Why would Snidgets be valuable to poachers?",
  "playerfemale_34753": "What is it?",
  "playerfemale_34754": "[[Are there other paintings like this here?]] Are there other empty paintings like this around the school?",
  "playerfemale_34755": "[[Perhaps I'll have a look.]] If I have the time, I may look. Could be intriguing.",
  "playerfemale_34757": "All right.",
  "playerfemale_34758": "[[I'll speak with Mr Bickle's friends.]] Very well. I'll speak with them – see what I can learn.",
  "playerfemale_34759": "[[What am I hoping to learn from them?]] What sort of information am I trying to gather from these people?",
  "playerfemale_34760": "May I ask you about Mr Bickle's friends?",
  "playerfemale_34762": "Excuse me, Mr Philbert?",
  "playerfemale_34763": "I wondered if I might speak with you about your dealings with Theophilus Harlow. I hope to ease Mrs Bickle's mind by gathering evidence against him.",
  "playerfemale_34764": "You said that Harlow committed an act of violence against you. Could you tell me what happened?",
  "playerfemale_34766": "I imagine you fear Harlow retaliating again, but do you mind if I share this information with Officer Singer?",
  "playerfemale_34767": "Mr Dibble? May I speak with you? It's about Theophilus Harlow.",
  "playerfemale_34768": "Please, sir. I would like to help. I spoke to Mrs Bickle.",
  "playerfemale_34769": "[[Thank you for talking with me.]] Thank you for telling me. I'm gathering evidence to take Harlow down.",
  "playerfemale_34770": "Mrs Rabe? I wondered if I might speak with you about Theophilus Harlow. I'm a friend of the Bickles and am trying to gather evidence against him.",
  "playerfemale_34772": "What do you mean? Why?",
  "playerfemale_34774": "I shall do all I can to get evidence against Harlow, Mrs Rabe.",
  "playerfemale_34775": "We're on the right track. Now to find the last of Mr Bickle's friends.",
  "playerfemale_34776": "I've spoken with Mr Bickle's friends. Now to find Natty.",
  "playerfemale_34777": "Now to find Mr Bickle's other two friends.",
  "playerfemale_34778": "It's not like Natty to be late. She said she was going to the Hog's Head. Perhaps I'll find her there.",
  "playerfemale_34779": "Natty's wand? She can cast without it. She wanted me to find this. She's in trouble.",
  "playerfemale_34780": "The footprints led to this room. There must be another way forward.",
  "playerfemale_34781": "A hidden door!",
  "playerfemale_34782": "I don't see a way to open the door!",
  "playerfemale_34783": "Whatever gave her that idea?",
  "playerfemale_34784": "Poachers were here. All sorts of evidence. But I found something else. It's goblin-made.",
  "playerfemale_34786": "Is this where we're meeting the centaurs?",
  "playerfemale_34787": "[[They'll understand.]] Once we tell them about the Snidgets, they'll understand why we came and they'll want to help.",
  "playerfemale_34788": "[[They won't like this.]] I'm not sure about this. I can't imagine they're fond of being surprised.",
  "playerfemale_34792": "And you think Peeves ripped those pages from the book I found in the Restricted Section!",
  "playerfemale_34795": "[[The authorities haven't been much help.]] With all due respect, Officer – the authorities haven't done much about any of this.",
  "playerfemale_34800": "Sebastian mentioned something about your uncle being an ex-Auror, but refusing to go after Ranrok's Loyalists.",
  "playerfemale_34801": "I must say, I wasn't prepared for him to be as angry as he was.",
  "playerfemale_34802": "Look! Down there!",
  "playerfemale_34803": "All right. I have the egg.",
  "playerfemale_34807": "[[Perhaps a reward – to keep the diary a secret.]] Unless you want your classmates to know how you really feel about them, you might reward me for my time.",
  "playerfemale_34808": "[[Here you go.]] Here you are.",
  "playerfemale_34809": "This must be Cressida's diary. I'd want this back, too, if I were her.",
  "playerfemale_34810": "Hmm. Seems as if I should hang something there.",
  "playerfemale_34811": "These lanterns must belong somewhere.",
  "playerfemale_34812": "Perhaps the lanterns are meant to be hung on the hands.",
  "playerfemale_34813": "That was the wrong square.",
  "playerfemale_34814": "I wonder if the chess pieces on the board indicate where I can't go.",
  "playerfemale_34815": "Perhaps I can find a way to reveal the path.",
  "playerfemale_34816": "How many more of these mannequins are there?",
  "playerfemale_34817": "Match wits? Just to sign a contract?",
  "playerfemale_34818": "This is what you call 'matching wits'?",
  "playerfemale_34819": "Professor Sharp, do you have a moment?",
  "playerfemale_34821": "[[Sounds dangerous.]] That seems a bit more dangerous than teaching Potions.",
  "playerfemale_34822": "[[Sounds exciting.]] That sounds positively exhilarating.",
  "playerfemale_34823": "May I ask what happened?",
  "playerfemale_34826": "[[You knew what was in that chest.]] You knew exactly where I was going when I entered that chest.",
  "playerfemale_34827": "Hello, Penny.",
  "playerfemale_34828": "[[Our agreement is almost sealed.]] Very well. I shall agree to your contract – with one, small addendum.",
  "playerfemale_34829": "I did. In order that I have a successful shop with lots of customers, would you agree to causing chaos only after nine o'clock in the evening?",
  "playerfemale_34830": "I would.",
  "playerfemale_34831": "Cassandra Mason – was she behind all of this?",
  "playerfemale_34832": "[[No need Penny. I am freeing you.]] Penny, I found an item of clothing in the dungeon that I'd like to give you.",
  "playerfemale_34833": "[[That's good to hear.]] I look forward to working with you.",
  "playerfemale_34834": "Penny, you're free! You can do anything you've ever wanted to.",
  "playerfemale_34835": "[[Never mind.]] Actually, it's nothing. Let's get the shop going.",
  "playerfemale_34837": "Professor, do you a have a moment to speak again?",
  "playerfemale_34838": "[[Were you interested in teaching Potions?]] Was it due to a particular interest in potions?",
  "playerfemale_34839": "[[Was it because of your injury?]] Was it due to an injury suffered during your time with the Ministry?",
  "playerfemale_34841": "You're seeking to heal the damage done to your leg?",
  "playerfemale_34842": "Indeed, sir. Thank you for your time. And I do hope you find a cure for your injury.",
  "playerfemale_34844": "Professor, do you have time to chat?",
  "playerfemale_34848": "Some of the professors may not agree with your approach.",
  "playerfemale_34849": "And that’s why you teach the way you do?",
  "playerfemale_34850": "[[How unfortunate.]] I'm sorry to hear that, sir. It sounds as if your experience as a student was less than ideal.",
  "playerfemale_34851": "I'll do my best, Professor. Thank you for the advice.",
  "playerfemale_34852": "[[You mentioned your education wasn't traditional.]] Professor, what did you mean when you said your education wasn't 'traditional'?",
  "playerfemale_34858": "[[I'm glad that you did.]] I for one am glad. I very much enjoy your class.",
  "playerfemale_34859": "[[I myself appreciate a more serious approach.]] I myself feel studying is worthy of a more serious approach.",
  "playerfemale_34860": "[[You don't have any friends?]] Haven't you any friends at school?",
  "playerfemale_34861": "I'd better keep an eye on high places around the school for Zenobia's Gobstones.",
  "playerfemale_34862": "Well that's one of Zenobia's Gobstones. I hardly see what all the fuss is about.",
  "playerfemale_34863": "Just one more Gobstone.",
  "playerfemale_34864": "[[I'm so sorry.]] I understand you've tried everyone from Nurse Blainey to St Mungo's to no avail.",
  "playerfemale_34865": "[[Surely there's something.]] It could be that you've not yet discovered the cure.",
  "playerfemale_34866": "Perhaps the healers don't know everything, sir.",
  "playerfemale_34867": "Sebastian is single-mindedly focused on finding a way to help his sister. If there is a cure, he will find it.",
  "playerfemale_34868": "[[I understand.]] I understand what you're saying, sir.",
  "playerfemale_34869": "[[Hope could be a good thing.]] With all due respect, sir, hope could keep Anne's spirits up.",
  "playerfemale_34870": "Both Anne and your uncle seem genuinely convinced that nothing more can be done for her.",
  "playerfemale_34873": "[[Who is Silvanus Selwyn?]] Silvanus Selwyn? I thought Victor Rookwood headed up the Ashwinders.",
  "playerfemale_34874": "[[Where is the castle?]] Where is Clagmar Castle?",
  "playerfemale_34875": "[[What are they doing that's so terrible?]] What's so dangerous about the Ashwinders?",
  "playerfemale_34876": "There's Selwyn. I wonder if I can pull his guards away.",
  "playerfemale_34878": "If that's what you want to do, Penny, then nothing would make me happier. I'm genuinely glad you'll be staying on.",
  "playerfemale_34881": "I still can't believe we escaped the Ashwinders.",
  "playerfemale_34882": "I wonder how everyone knows about it.",
  "playerfemale_34884": "I'm sorry. Has Officer Singer done anything with the evidence we provided?",
  "playerfemale_34887": "The cave must be somewhere in this – maze. I wonder what else is in here.",
  "playerfemale_34888": "I shall look forward to it.",
  "playerfemale_34889": "Hello. Were you calling me?",
  "playerfemale_34891": "[[Perhaps it made you who you are.]] Perhaps you wouldn't be who you are without that experience.",
  "playerfemale_34892": "This stairwell looks promising.",
  "playerfemale_34894": "[[It's not your fault.]] It's not your fault, Natty. There's nothing you could have done to prevent it.",
  "playerfemale_34895": "[[I'm sorry.]] I'm sorry, Natty. I wish there was something I could do to help.",
  "playerfemale_34901": "I agree, Natty. We'll get them. I've never seen someone so committed to a cause.",
  "playerfemale_34903": "Professor Weasley wanted to speak with me after class.",
  "playerfemale_34906": "Harlow knows that we saved Archie. And that we rescued Mr Rabe. The letter didn't come from Mrs Bickle, did it?",
  "playerfemale_34907": "[[We should take a moment.]] I don't know if we should be rushing into this.",
  "playerfemale_34908": "[[I'm ready.]] Agreed. Let's finish this.",
  "playerfemale_34909": "Fair point. All right. Let's go.",
  "playerfemale_34910": "But she warned us to stay out of it. Was rather adamant about it.",
  "playerfemale_34911": "Perhaps we ought to inform Officer Singer of our plans.",
  "playerfemale_34912": "I'd better watch my step in here.",
  "playerfemale_34913": "[[Any idea where to start?]] Where do you suggest I search first?",
  "playerfemale_34915": "No they didn't. Rookwood and Harlow are after me.",
  "playerfemale_34916": "Professor Fig told me to keep things quiet – but I know I can trust you, Natty.",
  "playerfemale_34917": "Rookwood and Harlow want something Professor Fig and I found at Gringotts.",
  "playerfemale_34918": "Just before I came to Hogwarts. In fact, it's why I was late to the Sorting Ceremony.",
  "playerfemale_34919": "A Portkey brought us there after the dragon attacked our carriage.",
  "playerfemale_34921": "I think that was all of them.",
  "playerfemale_34922": "It is a little strange we haven't heard anything from them.",
  "playerfemale_34924": "I hope we haven't kept you waiting long, Dorran.",
  "playerfemale_34925": "We do.",
  "playerfemale_34926": "What makes you say that?",
  "playerfemale_34927": "So many books!",
  "playerfemale_34928": "Whoever built this place certainly liked to read.",
  "playerfemale_34929": "Your Gran would love it here.",
  "playerfemale_34930": "Not Dorran, that's for certain.",
  "playerfemale_34931": "Always armed and ready for a fight, Ranrok's Loyalists.",
  "playerfemale_34934": "Where is he?",
  "playerfemale_34935": "That platform is just out of reach.",
  "playerfemale_34936": "I can use <i>Accio</i> on that platform below.",
  "playerfemale_34937": "I see a platform below. I wonder if I could use it.",
  "playerfemale_34938": "I'm glad to see you're doing so well.",
  "playerfemale_34939": "I am sorry, Natty. It's my fault you got hurt.",
  "playerfemale_34940": "[[You didn't think about it. You just acted.]] You did what came naturally.",
  "playerfemale_34941": "[[You made a choice to protect me.]] You quickly made the choice to protect me.",
  "playerfemale_34942": "Then I shouldn't feel guilty?",
  "playerfemale_34943": "From what I know of him, it seems there's a lot of your father in you.",
  "playerfemale_34945": "Everything is safer now because of us – because of you.",
  "playerfemale_34947": "Hello? There's a voice coming from that well.",
  "playerfemale_34948": "There's something about that tree –",
  "playerfemale_34949": "That spot must be a clue. I should look around in case it's nearby.",
  "playerfemale_34950": "The candles seem to be leading into the Forbidden Forest.",
  "playerfemale_34951": "The treasure must be nearby.",
  "playerfemale_34952": "Treasure hunting suits me.",
  "playerfemale_34953": "Good – different. I sensed a sort of surge of some kind.",
  "playerfemale_34954": "I believe so, sir.",
  "playerfemale_34955": "[[Why did Amit tell on you?]] Why did Amit tell Madam Scribner that they were your books?",
  "playerfemale_34956": "Hello, Cressida. I collected your books, including your diary.",
  "playerfemale_34957": "Sounds as if Silvanus Selwyn has to go.",
  "playerfemale_34958": "That's it for Selwyn. I should go and see Madam Olivier back in Cragcroft about that bounty.",
  "playerfemale_34959": "[[Why chase after Acromantula venom?]] Why would someone risk their life for spider venom?",
  "playerfemale_34960": "[[Second and third thoughts.]] Believe me, I am having thoughts – but I'm still convinced we should go ahead.",
  "playerfemale_34961": "[[None at all.]] I see no reason we should stop now.",
  "playerfemale_34963": "Understandable. We did sabotage their fighting ring and steal a dragon egg from them.",
  "playerfemale_34966": "I'll need to get those dried Billywig stings for Garreth if he's to finish his latest concoction.",
  "playerfemale_34967": "You want me to – follow the butterflies?",
  "playerfemale_34968": "[[I'll think about it.]] Very well. If I have time, I shall see where they lead.",
  "playerfemale_34969": "[[What did you hear about the Forest?]] What were the 'horrible stories' you were told about the Forbidden Forest?",
  "playerfemale_34972": "It seems as though things are getting worse. Best be on my guard.",
  "playerfemale_34973": "It sounds as if her astrolabe is just northeast of the dock. I should dive down and see.",
  "playerfemale_34974": "[[We're actually working together.]] I did, thank you. In fact, we're working together to try and rein in Ranrok.",
  "playerfemale_34975": "I – of course. Your owl mentioned your needing my help with something.",
  "playerfemale_34976": "[[Why does Mrs Sprottle have a Wiggenweld supply?]] Why does Mrs Sprottle keep a supply of Wiggenweld Potion on hand?",
  "playerfemale_34977": "[[Why did you leave your box of letters with the Sprottles?]] Why did Mr and Mrs Sprottle have your box of letters after all this time?",
  "playerfemale_34978": "Are you all right? We're looking for Mr Bickle.",
  "playerfemale_34979": "Oh – I'm terribly sorry, Mrs Bickle. Who killed your husband?",
  "playerfemale_34980": "I suspect he'll keep running if he's being followed.",
  "playerfemale_34981": "Is this Mr Bickle's home?",
  "playerfemale_34982": "Without <i>Revelio</i>, we'll have no hope of finding him.",
  "playerfemale_34985": "[[Why would Bardolph get involved with Rookwood?]] Why would Bardolph want to get involved with the Ashwinders?",
  "playerfemale_34986": "I don't think so.",
  "playerfemale_34987": "Let's go.",
  "playerfemale_34988": "Ranrok is working with Rookwood?",

  "playerfemale_34990": "Mrs Sprottle told me a little more about your brother, Bardolph.",
  "playerfemale_34991": "[[Do you think he might have run off?]] Could Bardolph have run off?",
  "playerfemale_34992": "I suppose I should start at the Forest, north of the hamlet.",

  "playerfemale_34995": "Thank you, Mrs Sprottle.",

  "playerfemale_35002": "This must be the cavern Mrs Sprottle mentioned.",
  "playerfemale_35003": "Better have a look around. See about the Horklumps and the box of letters.",
  "playerfemale_35004": "Better have a look around. See if I can find that box of letters.",
  "playerfemale_35005": "That's at least one Horklump.",

  "playerfemale_35007": "Almost there! One more Horklump to harvest.",
  "playerfemale_35008": "That's all the Horklumps for now. Mrs Sprottle should be pleased.",

  "playerfemale_35017": "I think that's everything. Sirona will be glad to have this back.",
  "playerfemale_35018": "I should find Mrs Sprottle. She'll be glad to get these Horklumps.",

  "playerfemale_35041": "[[Did Bardolph pack any belongings?]] Is there anything your brother took with him that might help to track him down?",
  "playerfemale_35042": "We need to get this open.",

  "playerfemale_35103": "I see Dorran finally convinced you to leave the Snidgets.",
  "playerfemale_35104": "[[I was happy to help a friend.]] Of course. It's the sort of thing friends do for each other, isn't it?",

  "playerfemale_35117": "Exactly.",
  "playerfemale_35118": "[[I trust him. Centaurs know things.]] I don't know, but I am inclined to believe him – what with his being a centaur and all.",
  "playerfemale_35119": "[[He was annoyingly cryptic.]] He could have been a bit clearer or stayed a moment and answered our questions.",
  "playerfemale_35120": "[[Isn't moonstone common?]] Isn't moonstone all around us? Why retrieve one from a cave?",
  "playerfemale_35121": "That's what the leader of the herd called him.",

  "playerfemale_35132": "[[Her concern is warranted.]] I don't blame her for being concerned. We have been involved in some dangerous activities.",
  "playerfemale_35133": "[[She should be proud of you.]] If she knew more about what you've done, I suspect she'd be proud.",
  "playerfemale_35134": "(chuckle) Has Officer Singer done anything with the evidence we provided?",
  "playerfemale_35138": "[[I doubt it's dangerous.]] I don't think Dorran would knowingly send us into danger.",

  "playerfemale_35148": "[[Well done.]] Well done. You certainly know what you are doing!",
  "playerfemale_35149": "We can. But, perhaps best not to tell anyone else about this for now. Even Ominis.",
  "playerfemale_35151": "I think we're going to be a bit distracted from runes for a moment.",
  "playerfemale_35152": "Ranrok's Loyalists never knew to look for it.",

  "playerfemale_35154": "Isidora and Percival Rackham – another of the Keepers – could see traces of ancient magic too.",
  "playerfemale_35156": "[[Happy to help.]] I'm glad I could be of help. Mrs Sprottle sends her best.",
  "playerfemale_35157": "They call themselves 'Keepers' because they're protecting some type of knowledge. It has to do with the vault at Gringotts.",
  "playerfemale_35158": "It is all a bit much, isn't it? – when you put it like that. The point is, we both have good reason to search this house –",
  "playerfemale_35159": "– you for answers about what happened to Anne, and me for answers about the Keepers.",
  "playerfemale_35160": "Fair enough. I can see the Undercroft through this stone wall – as though it's a window. This has happened before.",
  "playerfemale_35161": "That's true. And I'm still not sure what it all means.",
  "playerfemale_35162": "What I do know is that my ability allows me to travel through these 'windows' I see.",
  "playerfemale_35163": "There's one more thing. It's a bit odd, if I'm honest.",
  "playerfemale_35164": "Professor Fig says I have a rare connection to a powerful form of ancient magic.",
  "playerfemale_35165": "I'm still learning. But I can see traces of it, and I've cast magic I can't otherwise explain.",
  "playerfemale_35166": "I think so. I'm still learning. But I can see traces of it, and I've cast magic I can't otherwise explain.",
  "playerfemale_35167": "I know that's a lot to take in.",
  "playerfemale_35168": "[[The assignments have helped.]] Thank you, Professor. The extra assignments have been helpful.",
  "playerfemale_35169": "I don't think Mr Pemberton meant to use his own stationery. He knows something about those Demiguise moons.",
  "playerfemale_35170": "Pardon me sir, but about those curious Demiguise statues I've seen.",
  "playerfemale_35171": "[[I find them intriguing.]] They're quite clever.",
  "playerfemale_35172": "[[They're terrorising Gladwin Moon.]] They're causing Mr Moon terrible distress.",
  "playerfemale_35173": "[[Hogwarts caretaker is an important job.]] Mr Moon does a good deal for the school. And he's taught me a lot. He's terrified of those statues.",
  "playerfemale_35174": "[[He's too big for his boots.]] He is a bit much – for a caretaker. But he means well. And he's terrified of those statues.",
  "playerfemale_35178": "[[It was your friend from school.]] It was an old schoolmate of yours – Piers Pemberton.",
  "playerfemale_35179": "[[I don't think he likes that nickname.]] I don't think he likes being called that.",
  "playerfemale_35180": "[[Yes, him.]] Yes, him. That's the one.",
  "playerfemale_35181": "True. Perhaps this triptych will lead us to answers.",
  "playerfemale_35182": "[[Despite spending so much time on assignments.]] I'm glad to hear it. I'm not certain I needed all the extra assignments.",
  "playerfemale_35183": "Give me a moment. I'll explain in a second.",
  "playerfemale_35184": "Perhaps the book Professor Weasley wants me to get is upstairs.",
  "playerfemale_35185": "That's incredible. You know this area well.",
  "playerfemale_35186": "Do you think there's a connection to the triptych?",
  "playerfemale_35187": "Perhaps we could simply enjoy this victory for a moment.",
  "playerfemale_35188": "I suppose so.",
  "playerfemale_35191": "But if she was using the Undercroft – and the cellar beneath her manor in Feldcroft – why would she create this space?",
  "playerfemale_35192": "His are some of the memories I've seen. I don't think he and Isidora saw eye to eye on how this magic should be used.",
  "playerfemale_35193": "And the bad news?",
  "playerfemale_35194": "It's clear from her journal that Isidora Morganach was here.",
  "playerfemale_35195": "Are you finished with the drawing?",
  "playerfemale_35196": "[[I'm ready to leave.]] Agreed. I'm ready to leave if you are.",
  "playerfemale_35197": "[[I'm not ready to leave.]] That sounds a fine idea, but I would like to look around a little before we leave.",
  "playerfemale_35200": "I suppose it is rather late, isn't it?",
  "playerfemale_35201": "[[I'm ready to leave.]] Yes, please. I'm ready to leave if you are.",

  "playerfemale_35203": "The passage ends here? There must be another way through.",
  "playerfemale_35204": "Could I use a spell to move some of these barrels?",
  "playerfemale_35205": "Each of these barrels needs to be pulled up to the line on the floor.",
  "playerfemale_35206": "I don't understand. What can I do to help?",
  "playerfemale_35207": "The Grey Lady. I'd say hello, but she doesn't seem particularly social.",
  "playerfemale_35208": "A moth? Curious.",
  "playerfemale_35209": "Moths are attracted to light.",
  "playerfemale_35210": "I ought to see how the moth reacts to <i>Lumos</i>.",
  "playerfemale_35211": "This is a bit more complicated.",
  "playerfemale_35212": "There must be another moth nearby.",
  "playerfemale_35213": "I ought to stand on the pillar as it ascends.",
  "playerfemale_35214": "The floor looks a little weak here.",
  "playerfemale_35215": "Perhaps the only way forward – is down.",
  "playerfemale_35216": "I ought to use the crate to break through the floor here.",
  "playerfemale_35217": "This looks even more complex.",
  "playerfemale_35218": "Making this spin ought to raise that platform. That must be it.",
  "playerfemale_35219": "I need to bring moths to the door.",
  "playerfemale_35220": "What did that burst of magic do? Perhaps I should examine things from both sides of the archway.",

  "playerfemale_35222": "I can see a way out on one side, but when I pass through the archway, it's blocked by a wall.",
  "playerfemale_35223": "What did that burst of magic change on both sides of the archway? Something must be different.",
  "playerfemale_35224": "I need to see how the room changes when I move in and out of the archway.",
  "playerfemale_35225": "So that's it. I need to use both sides of the archway to get the platform to the other side of the bridge.",
  "playerfemale_35226": "Now to see what's changed on each side of this archway.",
  "playerfemale_35227": "Things are definitely different on either side of the archway, but how?",
  "playerfemale_35228": "What if I stood on one platform and used <i>Accio</i> on the other? That ought to work.",
  "playerfemale_35229": "Are you the reason students have been seeing Hippogriffs flying above the Forbidden Forest?",
  "playerfemale_35230": "I wonder what's under these vines?",
  "playerfemale_35231": "I should use <i>Incendio</i> to burn these vines away.",
  "playerfemale_35232": "I should be able to burn away these webs.",

  "playerfemale_35236": "Oh! Behind the rock. There's the symbol.",
  "playerfemale_35237": "I'll need to look around for the symbol.",
  "playerfemale_35238": "Perhaps the next symbol is hidden somewhere.",
  "playerfemale_35239": "Perhaps it's under the platform.",
  "playerfemale_35240": "[[Thank you, Deek.]] Thank you for your help, Deek.",
  "playerfemale_35241": "We're being watched. By a door.",
  "playerfemale_35242": "We won't get through as long as we can be seen by that eye.",
  "playerfemale_35243": "I should use disillusionment. That eye won't see a thing.",
  "playerfemale_35244": "The door is looking at us.",
  "playerfemale_35245": "We need to break its line of sight somehow.",
  "playerfemale_35246": "Disillusionment should get us through that door.",
  "playerfemale_35247": "We'll need to get across this gap somehow.",
  "playerfemale_35248": "There ought to be something around here to help cross the gap.",
  "playerfemale_35249": "<i>Accio</i> ought to bring that platform closer. That could help bridge the gap.",
  "playerfemale_35250": "Another boiler. But it's not boiling.",
  "playerfemale_35251": "This should work the same way as the last one.",
  "playerfemale_35252": "<i>Incendio</i> should get this boiler working.",
  "playerfemale_35253": "[[It was someone you bullied in school.]] It was a classmate of yours that you bullied – Piers Pemberton.",
  "playerfemale_35254": "I need to keep going forward somehow.",
  "playerfemale_35255": "What can I use to make my way through here?",
  "playerfemale_35256": "<i>Accio</i> should bring that platform right to me.",
  "playerfemale_35257": "I wonder where these pipes go?",
  "playerfemale_35258": "Those pipes must power something around here.",
  "playerfemale_35259": "<i>Incendio</i> ought to light the boiler and provide some power to these machines.",
  "playerfemale_35260": "Another boiler. Crafty goblins.",
  "playerfemale_35261": "If this is anything like last time, I need to fire up this boiler to supply power to the pipes.",
  "playerfemale_35262": "<i>Incendio</i> will light this. Then I can move along from here once and for all.",
  "playerfemale_35263": "I have to find a way to stop that drill.",
  "playerfemale_35264": "The pillars are weakening.",
  "playerfemale_35265": "Destroying the pillars will bring the ceiling down on the drill.",
  "playerfemale_35266": "No, Sebastian. I haven't. You're not listening to me.",
  "playerfemale_35267": "He's in Hogsmeade, apparently. Perhaps I shall pay him a visit.",
  "playerfemale_35268": "(gasp)",
  "playerfemale_35269": "(pained cry)",
  "playerfemale_35270": "Mr Moon, I've learned who's behind the Demiguise statues.",
  "playerfemale_35271": "There must be something here that I need.",
  "playerfemale_35272": "Perhaps something here belongs in the portrait frame.",
  "playerfemale_35273": "Perhaps I should try casting <i>Lumos</i> near that moth.",
  "playerfemale_35274": "I should check the map again for clues.",
  "playerfemale_35275": "One more to go and I'll make it across.",
  "playerfemale_35276": "Something is getting in the way of that platform.",
  "playerfemale_35277": "Perhaps I should cast <i>Accio</i> to get that frame out of the way first.",
  "playerfemale_35306": "Professor, what made you want to teach Herbology?",
  "playerfemale_35308": "Oh dear. A shame for him, but it worked out well for you.",
  "playerfemale_35310": "[[That's awful.]] What a string of bad luck.",
  "playerfemale_35311": "[[That's almost comical.]] Fair bit of bad luck there, I'd say.",
  "playerfemale_35312": "[[I'm glad things worked out as they did.]] I'm glad everything worked out as it did, and that you're the Herbology professor now.",
  "playerfemale_35313": "[[I feel sorry for the former professor.]] I had no idea. How awful.",
  "playerfemale_35315": "Professor Garlick. A moment of your time?",

  "playerfemale_35355": "During class, you mentioned the Toyohashi Quidditch team.",

  "playerfemale_35379": "There's something intriguing about that tree.",
  "playerfemale_35380": "Perhaps I could get that tree to move.",
  "playerfemale_35381": "Casting <i>Levioso</i> ought to raise the tree out of the ground.",
  "playerfemale_35382": "More crystallised stone. That must be the way back to the Map Chamber.",
  "playerfemale_35383": "Another Pensieve.",
  "playerfemale_35384": "More traces of ancient magic. Something must be different.",
  "playerfemale_35385": "Each side is different somehow.",
  "playerfemale_35386": "I must remember to examine these archways from both sides.",
  "playerfemale_35387": "The room around me has changed again.",
  "playerfemale_35388": "When I pass through the archway, I enter another room entirely. A new room.",
  "playerfemale_35389": "Orders. Directly from Ranrok.",
  "playerfemale_35390": "Perhaps these blocks can be moved.",
  "playerfemale_35391": "These blocks must be moved in order for me to climb up.",
  "playerfemale_35392": "I should try casting <i>Depulso</i> to move those blocks.",
  "playerfemale_35393": "I need to move the blocks into place to jump this gap.",
  "playerfemale_35394": "Perhaps I should get the blocks back to the starting position.",
  "playerfemale_35395": "Perhaps casting at that object over there will help somehow.",
  "playerfemale_35396": "That platform looks like it ought to get me where I need to go.",
  "playerfemale_35397": "Ominis, Sebastian meant well – ",
  "playerfemale_35398": "I suppose I should watch for Gwyneira. At night, apparently.",
  "playerfemale_35399": "[[I could keep her.]] Sounds as if she needs rescuing. I know the perfect place.",
  "playerfemale_35400": "[[You'd be better than poachers.]] Seems you're more concerned with the feathers than the bird. But she'd be safer with you than with poachers.",
  "playerfemale_35401": "It doesn't work like that. To access each of these memories, I have to complete a trial. It's not as easy as you think.",
  "playerfemale_35402": "They're showing me the memories in a particular order. They – ",
  "playerfemale_35403": "[[Of course I do.]] Of course I care, Sebastian. We've come this far. Don't let your frustration get the better of you.",
  "playerfemale_35404": "[[Perhaps I should do this on my own.]] I do care about Anne, but I'm tired of explaining myself. Perhaps we should part ways.",
  "playerfemale_35405": "We don't have a choice.",
  "playerfemale_35406": "I know.",
  "playerfemale_35407": "Now, shall we see why the triptych led us here?",
  "playerfemale_35408": "All right.",
  "playerfemale_35409": "Listen to me. I know you're angry and frustrated. But charging ahead now could undo all the progress we've made.",
  "playerfemale_35410": "Lodgok said –",
  "playerfemale_35411": "Stop it. That's enough. Not all goblins are like Ranrok. I am not the enemy. We want the same thing: to find answers.",
  "playerfemale_35412": "We do. Listen to me. Lodgok has insights into Ranrok that we don't.",
  "playerfemale_35413": "Good. Ranrok clearly knows more than we thought. We need to be careful and do this right. Not just go charging in.",
  "playerfemale_35415": "They attacked you?",
  "playerfemale_35416": "I know Mr Hill. He was kind to me the day of the troll attack.",
  "playerfemale_35420": "In addition to abducting Mr Rabe – to blackmail his wife – and Natty, Rookwood and Harlow have also extorted Agabus Philbert and Otto Dibble.",
  "playerfemale_35421": "[[Perhaps I'm not.]] And you're not who I thought you to be. Based upon your diary, you seem terribly judgemental.",
  "playerfemale_35422": "[[I'm only joking.]] I wouldn't do that to you, Cressida. Only trying to teach you to be a little more careful.",
  "playerfemale_35440": "There must be some sort of clue on the painting itself.",
  "playerfemale_35441": "I wonder what casting <i>Accio</i> on that ring atop the painting would do?",
  "playerfemale_35459": "Are you concerned she might tell your mother?",
  "playerfemale_35460": "That I do.",
  "playerfemale_35461": "He told me that Ranrok somehow knows about the Keepers and is searching anywhere connected to each of them.",
  "playerfemale_35462": "That's why they always seem to be one step ahead. I know what I'm doing. You need to trust me, or I don't see that we can continue together.",
  "playerfemale_35463": "We have our work cut out for us. We need to work together if we're going to find the final piece to the triptych.",
  "playerfemale_35464": "Now to get out of this blasted place.",
  "playerfemale_35465": "But I don't understand why she seems to have gone to such great lengths to tell her story without their knowledge.",
  "playerfemale_35466": "So do I.",
  "playerfemale_35470": "Believe it or not, it's in the Headmaster's office.",
  "playerfemale_35471": "Now, to free Arn's carts.",
  "playerfemale_35472": "Professor Fitzgerald seemed very concerned.",
  "playerfemale_35473": "So, how do you already have Polyjuice Potion to change into Professor Black?",
  "playerfemale_35474": "I do. And, thank you Sharp. I just hope you've brewed enough for all my boils.",
  "playerfemale_35475": "Interesting way to hide some treasure.",
  "playerfemale_35476": "Prime potion ingredient. And I know you fancy yourself a skilled potioneer.",
  "playerfemale_35477": "Bah! That's enough from you. Just know that I have eyes and ears everywhere.",
  "playerfemale_35478": "I say – why don't you bring a sample of your next batch to my office? I'd like to give it a try.",
  "playerfemale_35479": "What was that, Broom?",
  "playerfemale_35480": "Obviously.",
  "playerfemale_35481": "Ah, yes, of course. I order you to pronounce it for me.",
  "playerfemale_35482": "Ah, Professor Weasley. How, er, delightful to see you.",
  "playerfemale_35483": "Ah! Since I have you here, I wonder if I might – um – speak with you about Professor Fig.",
  "playerfemale_35484": "I've decided to give him a bit more, er, leeway with his time.",
  "playerfemale_35485": "[[He's handling secret Ministry matters.]] Ah. Well, yes. He's handling some official Ministry business for me.",
  "playerfemale_35486": "Ahem, I mean, I shall keep an eye on Fig. You simply keep doing the wonderful job that you're doing. Simply wonderful.",
  "playerfemale_35487": "Good. Good. That will be all Weasley – er – I mean Professor Weasley. Good day.",
  "playerfemale_35491": "The final canvas piece to the triptych. We've done it!",
  "playerfemale_35492": "[[Oh, really?]] Really? Why can't we talk about potions here? Seems fine to me.",
  "playerfemale_35493": "This door must need power from something.",
  "playerfemale_35494": "Looks as if there are pipes leading into it.",
  "playerfemale_35495": "If I light the boiler, the door should open.",
  "playerfemale_35497": "<i>Imperio</i>!",
  "playerfemale_35498": "Step aside, Ominis. Stay in place until we're out of sight.",
  "playerfemale_35499": "Young? I know. You must be Professor Bakar.",
  "playerfemale_35500": "Pleased to meet you. The Pensieve memory I just witnessed – was Isidora inhaling painful emotions?",
  "playerfemale_35501": "[[It was fascinating.]] I was amazed to see that it seemed to give her some sort of power – and that she could harness it. But how?",
  "playerfemale_35502": "[[It was disturbing.]] I found it disturbing. But how did she gain power from it? How did she harness it?",
  "playerfemale_35503": "I can assure you, Professor, I do. In fact, what you don't yet know is that a dangerous goblin called Ranrok has accessed the repository at Rookwood Castle.",
  "playerfemale_35504": "He has learned to harness the contents of it as a source of immense power. He plans to use that power against wizardkind. We have no time to waste.",
  "playerfemale_35506": "Possibly. There's something I didn't get a chance to tell you earlier – Ranrok has been digging at locations tied to the five names he found in the journals of a goblin metalworker named Bragbor.",
  "playerfemale_35508": "Precisely. That's how he's been one step ahead of us. Gringotts, the tower, Rookwood Castle.",
  "playerfemale_35509": "Perhaps. I hope to hear from Lodgok soon. I haven't heard anything since I learned of the drills.",
  "playerfemale_35510": "And I discovered that they're building massive drills to help in their search.",
  "playerfemale_35511": "[[And I don't miss him.]] I realise that – and I'd like to keep it that way.",
  "playerfemale_35512": "[[You were rather careless.]] You ought to be more cautious in the future. Men like Rookwood and Harlow could do much worse than stealing a book.",
  "playerfemale_35513": "[[Centaurs may be too hostile to help.]] Centaurs aren't known for being the friendliest lot. Especially not with wizardkind – and not right now.",
  "playerfemale_35514": "[[People don't give creatures enough credit.]] Creatures are a lot cleverer than most people realise.",
  "playerfemale_35515": "How charming. They keep in touch with each other.",
  "playerfemale_35516": "Watch your step.",
  "playerfemale_35517": "[[But everything's fine now.]] If your gran's all right, and they didn't get the egg, then perhaps we're fine.",
  "playerfemale_35518": "It looks as if a way out has appeared in one of the rooms.",
  "playerfemale_35519": "Once again, this archway allows me to step between completely different rooms.",
  "playerfemale_35520": "(cough) What? Ahem. Goodness. You cannot believe everything you hear, Professor. No, no, no you cannot.",
  "playerfemale_35521": "Thank you, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_35522": "[[Yes.]] Professor Fig has encouraged me to explore when I can – in, er, an effort to complete my Field Guide.",
  "playerfemale_35523": "[[No.]] Not at all. I was, er, merely interested in learning more about the Auror Programme. I saw Professor Sharp's Auror badge and was intrigued.",
  "playerfemale_35524": "[[No.]] Not at all. I, uh, enjoy talking to Mr Ollivander. I'm fascinated by wandlore. And I'd never visited the Owlery. Bit of a mess. (chuckle)",
  "playerfemale_35525": "[[No.]] Not at all. I was, er, intrigued by stories of a giant squid and wanted to learn more. I encountered Scrope – who seemed delighted to share what he knew.",
  "playerfemale_35526": "[[No.]] Not at all. I'm fascinated by ghosts, and, uh, food. And I was interested in learning more about the castle and the surrounding area.",
  "playerfemale_35527": "That must be the way to the repository.",
  "playerfemale_35528": "More of them!",
  "playerfemale_35529": "This one's almost down.",
  "playerfemale_35530": "Professor! More trouble ahead.",
  "playerfemale_35532": "After what Ranrok did to that goblin banker at Gringotts, I shouldn't be surprised at what happened to Arn.",
  "playerfemale_35533": "Past the ruins – I'm on the right track.",
  "playerfemale_35534": "Those traces of magic are somehow protecting the dragon.",
  "playerfemale_35535": "That did the trick. I have you now, Ranrok.",
  "playerfemale_35536": "I know you're feeling it now, Ranrok.",
  "playerfemale_35537": "You've protected yourself again. Not for long.",
  "playerfemale_35538": "Two sources of power?",
  "playerfemale_35539": "There's nowhere to hide now, Ranrok.",
  "playerfemale_35540": "I will defeat you. In Lodgok's memory.",
  "playerfemale_35541": "This is for Professor Fig!",
  "playerfemale_35542": "Not so powerful now, are you Ranrok?",
  "playerfemale_35543": "This is the end, you monster.",
  "playerfemale_35544": "I need to break its connection to those traces of magic.",
  "playerfemale_35545": "I imagine a piece of that enormous Venomous Tentacula would be enough for Duncan to prove his bravery.",
  "playerfemale_35546": "I – I suppose being an Auror is dreadfully dangerous. I'm sorry.",
  "playerfemale_35547": "Well said, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_35548": "[[You can't fight fate.]] If it truly is fate, seems there's not much you can do about it.",
  "playerfemale_35549": "[[Fear won't steer me either.]] I'll not let fear dictate my future either.",
  "playerfemale_35550": "I'm nearly finished. Only one more vase.",
  "playerfemale_35551": "Her memories showed what she did for her father – which I also saw in Professor Rookwood's Pensieve –",
  "playerfemale_35552": "– and a conversation with Bragbor in which she expressed frustration about the limits being placed on her use of ancient magic.",
  "playerfemale_35553": "Quite an enchantment. The carts are returning to Arn.",
  "playerfemale_35554": "Sounds like Feldcroft's in trouble. Perhaps I should try to help.",
  "playerfemale_35555": "That crate of Chinese Chomping Cabbages is somewhere in this camp.",
  "playerfemale_35556": "Ranrok's Loyalists are hiding out near Feldcroft. They must have the other crate of Chinese Chomping Cabbages.",
  "playerfemale_35557": "That's all of the crates of Chinese Chomping Cabbages. I'd better go and see Mr Thistlewood's friend in Feldcroft.",
  "playerfemale_35558": "That's one crate in hand. I only need one more.",
  "playerfemale_35562": "[[It was difficult.]] The ones I faced were determined to make things difficult.",
  "playerfemale_35563": "[[It was no trouble.]] I managed to free your carts fairly easily.",
  "playerfemale_35564": "Poppy – something's going on behind you.",
  "playerfemale_35565": "What now? She didn't exactly leave us a calling card.",
  "playerfemale_35566": "[[Let's get out of here.]] We aren't helping ourselves standing here. Let's get to safety; we can sort this out later.",
  "playerfemale_35568": "[[What should we do with the egg?]] Since the dragon we freed flew off, does that mean we get to keep the egg?",
  "playerfemale_35569": "[[Do you think the poachers will retaliate?]] Should we expect trouble from the poachers? Given the trouble we just caused?",
  "playerfemale_35570": "It seems Arn's whole life is in those carts. I hope I can find them.",
  "playerfemale_35574": "I take it this means you had some luck at the library?",
  "playerfemale_35575": "I also know the promise, Professor. With all I have learned, I can avoid making the same mistakes Isidora did. I can learn to wield this magic for good.",
  "playerfemale_35576": "[[You're right.]] No, you're right. I haven't forgotten. The cost is too high. Perhaps this magic is best kept contained.",
  "playerfemale_35577": "Professor!",
  "playerfemale_35578": "[[Nothing comes to mind.]] That will be all. Thank you for your time.",
  "playerfemale_35579": "I agree, Natty. We'll get him. I've never seen someone so committed to a cause.",
  "playerfemale_35580": "It's good to see you again, Dorran. Did Poppy tell you about everything that's happened?",
  "playerfemale_35581": "What is it?",
  "playerfemale_35582": "Professor Weasley's tasks are complete. I should attend Transfiguration.",
  "playerfemale_35583": "[[Have you heard from your parents?]]  I don't suppose you've heard anything from your parents, have you?",
  "playerfemale_35584": "[[Did you tell your Gran we found the Snidgets?]] Does your Gran know that we found the Snidgets?",
  "playerfemale_35585": "[[Stay out of trouble, Poppy.]]  It has all been a pleasure, Poppy. Do try and stay out of trouble.",
  "playerfemale_35587": "There’s the Hogwarts Express. Must be returning from an unscheduled run.",
  "playerfemale_35588": "Best keep that little manoeuvre between us, Highwing.",
  "playerfemale_35589": "Looks as if there's more than one way to enter.",
  "playerfemale_35590": "And that's when you took over as the Herbology professor?",
  "playerfemale_35593": "Have I not proven myself, Professor? I need to get to that repository before Ranrok does.",
  "playerfemale_35594": "So the repository is safe from Ranrok for now.",
  "playerfemale_35595": "[[Was there anything else in the student's report?]] I'd be interested to know what else the student discovered.",
  "playerfemale_35597": "[[Centaurs are known for being wise.]] I suppose they are known for having an air of omniscience.",
  "playerfemale_35598": "[[Centaurs don't know any more than the rest of us.]] I hope they can tell we're sincere but, Poppy, centaurs are just –centaurs. They can't read your mind any better than I could.",
  "playerfemale_35601": "[[I'll get started.]] Of course. I'll start to search for those barricades.",
  "playerfemale_35602": "[[I'm interested in seeing that student report.]] I'd be interested to know what else the student discovered.",
  "playerfemale_35603": "[[Where do you think these diary pages came from?]] Do you think the pages were left here on purpose?",
  "playerfemale_35604": "Now, here's a new challenge.",
  "playerfemale_35605": "Rickety bone bridge complete.",
  "playerfemale_35606": "I need to find a safe way across.",
  "playerfemale_35607": "Perhaps moving piles of bones toward the centre will help.",
  "playerfemale_35608": "I believe I need to use <i>Accio</i> on the pile of bones.",
  "playerfemale_35609": "Sebastian! The relic. Look.",
  "playerfemale_35610": "<i>Imperio</i>. It was the only way to get out of here without a fight.",
  "playerfemale_35611": "We agreed on what was needed, Sebastian. You have my word.",
  "playerfemale_35612": "I did. But with his consent, Sebastian. It may seem an irrelevant difference, but it is a difference.",
  "playerfemale_35615": "[[That sounds wonderful.]] What a nice idea, Arn. I wish you luck with it.",
  "playerfemale_35616": "[[That's a little excessive.]] I'm not sure that's worthy of a painting.",
  "playerfemale_35617": "[[What 'crest' are you sending to Anne?]] What did you mean you'd send Anne a 'crest' so that she'd know to meet you?",
  "playerfemale_35618": "Fig had a Portkey that led us there after the dragon attack. It's a bit of a long story, and Fig had asked that I not speak of it yet.",
  "playerfemale_35619": "And Ranrok's after something I found at Gringotts.",
  "playerfemale_35620": "Fig had a Portkey that led us there after the dragon attack. It's a bit of a long story, and Fig's asked that I not speak of it yet.",
  "playerfemale_35621": "We'll simply be honest with them about what we're trying to do. They'll have to help us, won't they?",
  "playerfemale_35622": "Didn't the journal say 'The key to finding the Snidgets lies in the moonlight'?",
  "playerfemale_35623": "Professor, could you spare a moment?",
  "playerfemale_35624": "[[I'm interested in goblin rebellions.]]I'm interested in the goblin rebellions of the past.",
  "playerfemale_35625": "[[Never mind.]]Apologies, Professor. Perhaps later.",
  "playerfemale_35626": "[[Hogsmeade was attacked.]]But Hogsmeade was just attacked, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_35627": "[[Thank you for your time.]]Thank you for your time, Professor Binns.",
  "playerfemale_35628": "[[That's very interesting.]]Please go on.",
  "playerfemale_35629": "[[I need to go now.]]Ah, well, it appears I'm out of time. Thank you, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_35630": "[[Yes, absolutely.]]Oh, oh yes, Professor. Please continue.",
  "playerfemale_35631": "[[I'm afraid not. Thank you for your time.]]Not exactly, Professor. But I must be on my way.",
  "playerfemale_35633": "[[I would love to hear more.]]If you would be so kind, Professor Binns.",
  "playerfemale_35634": "[[I have the information I needed.]]On the contrary, you've been most helpful. Goodbye.",
  "playerfemale_35637": "I find your lectures quite engaging, sir. Thank you for sharing your vast knowledge.",
  "playerfemale_35639": "[[Very well. I shall leave you to it.]] Good luck with Ominis. Until we meet again.",
  "playerfemale_35644": "There's Sebastian.",
  "playerfemale_35645": "I need to find a way up that ledge.",
  "playerfemale_35646": "Perhaps I need to open the sarcophagi.",
  "playerfemale_35647": "I need to move the bones and make a bridge.",
  "playerfemale_35648": "I can't let him leave.",
  "playerfemale_35649": "'Control'? I had to fight Inferi all the way – ",
  "playerfemale_35652": "I'm afraid I don't follow.",
  "playerfemale_35653": "[[What sort of courses are these?]] Can you tell me more about these courses?",
  "playerfemale_35654": "Well, surrounding the moonstone with birds that can drive people mad would certainly be one way to keep it safe.",
  "playerfemale_35655": "I don't know, I've been listening to them for a while now and I'm starting to lose my mind.",
  "playerfemale_35656": "[[Sounds worth a try, Mr Weekes.]] That sounds intriguing – I'll see what I can do.",
  "playerfemale_35657": "[[You took Madam Kogawa's class?]] Sounds as though you took Kogawa's class.",
  "playerfemale_35658": "[[How did your passion for brooms begin?]] How long have you had a passion for brooms?",
  "playerfemale_35661": "[[I can't believe you didn't tell me.]] Why didn't you tell me this before? After all our time together?",
  "playerfemale_35662": "[[Thank you for trusting me.]] I'm glad you told me.",
  "playerfemale_35663": "If the demand for potions is as high as you say, have you considered being easier to work with? Perhaps combining your recipes and skills?",
  "playerfemale_35664": "[[I'd rather not.]] I'd rather not, but if you insist, so be it.",
  "playerfemale_35665": "[[May I ask you about the letters in the box?]] I wondered about some of the letters in the box.",
  "playerfemale_35666": "[[Were you on the Quidditch team?]] One of the letters mentions Quidditch practice. Did you play?",
  "playerfemale_35667": "[[Is 'Mirabel' Professor Garlick?]] I saw a letter from someone named 'Mirabel.' Is that Professor Garlick?",
  "playerfemale_35668": "[[Are Mrs Sprottle and you as close as you seem?]] I spotted a letter from you to Mrs Sprottle. You two seem to have a lot of fun together.",
  "playerfemale_35669": "Ranrok's Loyalists – just ahead. Should I take them by force or be discreet?",
  "playerfemale_35670": "Yes, Professor. Of course.",
  "playerfemale_35673": "Hello, Adelaide. I received your owl –",
  "playerfemale_35674": "Adelaide Oakes, isn't it? I received your owl –",
  "playerfemale_35675": "Hello, Adelaide. You've still not heard from your uncle?",
  "playerfemale_35676": "[[I would be worried.]] I think you're right to be concerned, Adelaide. Your uncle may be in trouble.",
  "playerfemale_35677": "[[I think you're overreacting.]] I'm not convinced you need to worry. Perhaps your uncle's been delayed. And surely he can take care of himself.",
  "playerfemale_35679": "[[Can you tell me more about your uncle's business with goblins?]] Has your uncle traded with many goblins?",
  "playerfemale_35681": "I think I'll just have a look around for now.",
  "playerfemale_35687": "(ahem) Attention, students. I hereby decree that the Great Hall be forthwith decorated in the noble banners of Gryffindor. I shall be taking no questions at this time. Or ever.",
  "playerfemale_35688": "(ahem) Attention, students. I hereby decree that the Great Hall be forthwith decorated in the stunning banners of Slytherin. I shall be taking no questions at this time. Or ever.",
  "playerfemale_35689": "(ahem) Attention, students. I hereby decree that the Great Hall be forthwith decorated in the dignified banners of Hufflepuff. I shall be taking no questions at this time. Or ever.",
  "playerfemale_35690": "(ahem) Attention, students. I hereby decree that the Great Hall be forthwith decorated in the elegant banners of Ravenclaw. I shall be taking no questions at this time. Or ever.",
  "playerfemale_35692": "It does, somewhat. But, at the moment, I'm more concerned about what else you heard the poachers are up to.",
  "playerfemale_35693": "Adelaide mentioned her uncle's camp may be near Brocburrow – past the river.",
  "playerfemale_35694": "I heard the Ashwinders were causing trouble around here.",
  "playerfemale_35695": "Mr Oakes's trade journal.",
  "playerfemale_35696": "What will we find in here?",
  "playerfemale_35697": "It's all right, Mr Oakes. I've dealt with these goblins before.",
  "playerfemale_35698": "[[What did you overhear?]] You mentioned you overhead things?",
  "playerfemale_35699": "[[Glad I was able to help.]] I'm grateful I was able to help you, Mr Oakes. Adelaide thinks the world of you.",
  "playerfemale_35700": "A boiler door. How to open it?",
  "playerfemale_35701": "A furnace. Could be promising.",
  "playerfemale_35702": "I should try lighting that furnace. It must be connected to the boiler door.",
  "playerfemale_35703": "Fortunately, I've already found your wand, Mr Oakes.",
  "playerfemale_35704": "I need to find Mr Oakes's wand. Where could it be?",
  "playerfemale_35705": "[[Do you speak Gobbledegook?]] Am I right that you speak Gobbledegook?",
  "playerfemale_35706": "What do you sell?",
  "playerfemale_35707": "I've already caught at least one of them. I wasn't sure what they were for.",
  "playerfemale_35708": "I actually found them all and opened the chest.",
  "playerfemale_35709": "I found a rather interesting costume.",
  "playerfemale_35710": "Hello, Nellie. Actually, I've found all of the keys and opened my house chest.",
  "playerfemale_35714": "[[Thank you.]]It was a pleasure doing business with you, Mr Pippin.",
  "playerfemale_35715": "[[I'd like an additional fee.]] Delivering those potions was a bit more work than I'd expected. I'd like an additional fee.",

  "playerfemale_35718": "I found a rather interesting costume.",

  "playerfemale_35733": "[[She's safer with me.]] I think Biscuit will be safer with me, Garnuff.",
  "playerfemale_35734": "[[I'll leave her with you.]] If you're certain you can keep her safe, I suppose I can leave her with you.",
  "playerfemale_35735": "[[I'm afraid I must.]] Biscuit is clearly not safe with you and I know how to protect her.",
  "playerfemale_35736": "That chest looks interesting.",

  "playerfemale_35741": "Now that it's night, I ought to look into this thievery business for Mr Haggarty.",
  "playerfemale_35742": "A pile of gold? I must be on the right track. It looks as if the thief took more than they could carry.",
  "playerfemale_35743": "More gold. I must be getting closer.",
  "playerfemale_35744": "A Niffler? It wasn't Catrin Haggarty after all.",
  "playerfemale_35745": "That must be the Haggarty family heirloom!",
  "playerfemale_35746": "[[You can have it back – for a price.]] I found your heirloom and I'll give it back to you – for a price.",
  "playerfemale_35747": "I take it you're a fan.",
  "playerfemale_35748": "[[We all need a bit of luck.]] I know that feeling. Some things are simply out of our control.",
  "playerfemale_35749": "[[Surely skill could overcome bad luck.]] If you were that good, I can't believe a 'bit of bad luck' could end your entire Quidditch career.",
  "playerfemale_35750": "[[I'm not sure what that is.]] What is Felix Felicis? A potion?",
  "playerfemale_35751": "[[That's awful.]] Liquid Luck? That's illegal, isn't it?",
  "playerfemale_35752": "What happened to Asuka? Did she burn her broom as well?",

  "playerfemale_35760": "[[Anything more to those owls?]] Any other pertinent details about those owls?",
  "playerfemale_35761": "Hello. Do you have anything for sale?",
  "playerfemale_35762": "Something to consider. Thank you for your help, Mr Babcocke.",
  "playerfemale_35763": "[[I like to explore.]] Just exploring the countryside a bit.",

  "playerfemale_35770": "[[I don't know much about Merlin.]] I don't know much about Merlin, if I'm honest. But your wife's work sounds intriguing.",
  "playerfemale_35772": "I actually met her, and she introduced me to her work. I'm involved in it now as well.",
  "playerfemale_35773": "Impressive. I'd like to meet her one day.",

  "playerfemale_35775": "Thank you, Mr Prakash. Best of luck to you and your father.",
  "playerfemale_35776": "Is that right? How long have you been in business?",
  "playerfemale_35777": "[[I'm sorry to hear that.]] Oh, that's a shame. I'm sorry about your father.",
  "playerfemale_35778": "[[Congratulations on your success.]] Congratulations on your many years of success – to you and your father.",
  "playerfemale_35779": "He wanted me to have a safe place to practise some spells – to try and catch up to the other fifth-years. He didn't think you'd mind.",

  "playerfemale_35782": "Wait. You've never been inside?",
  "playerfemale_35783": "[[Aren't you curious about what's inside?]] I'm sorry about your aunt. Don't you want to find out what happened to her?",
  "playerfemale_35784": "[[I understand your caution.]] That is a bit unnerving. I suppose even if it might lead to answers about what happened to your aunt, it does pose a risk.",
  "playerfemale_35785": "[[Very well. I'll do it.]] Very well. You've convinced me.",
  "playerfemale_35786": "[[I'll find another way.]] Very well. I'll see what I can do.",
  "playerfemale_35787": "[[Can you tell me about your customers?]] You mentioned that more and more customers are trying to stay out of sight. Why?",
  "playerfemale_35788": "I wonder if I need to place lanterns to open these doors.",
  "playerfemale_35789": "[[If it is, she doesn't deserve it back.]] You should keep it. She doesn't deserve to have it.",

  "playerfemale_35792": "Go on.",
  "playerfemale_35793": "[[Why am I the right person for this?]] Why do you need me to report to you on this broom flight?",

  "playerfemale_35799": "[[Can you tell me more about the Irondale course?]] What more can you tell me about the next course?",
  "playerfemale_35800": "So you did create them.",
  "playerfemale_35801": "I am. At the request of Mr Moon. I received your owl. On your stationery.",
  "playerfemale_35802": "[[My apologies.]] Sounds as if Mr Moon deserved what he got. But perhaps it's time you both moved on.",
  "playerfemale_35803": "[[You're no better than Mr Moon.]] The statues are a form of bullying. You're no better than him. Perhaps it's time you both moved on.",
  "playerfemale_35804": "And you think this 'relic' might be able to save Anne.",
  "playerfemale_35805": "What a horrible story.",
  "playerfemale_35806": "I didn't. I promise.",
  "playerfemale_35807": "Thank you, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_35808": "Thank you, Professor. I – ",

  "playerfemale_35815": "I need to find a way into the gatehouse to open the gate for Natty.",
  "playerfemale_35816": "This box should help me reach the ledge.",
  "playerfemale_35817": "How can I raise the box?",
  "playerfemale_35818": "Perhaps I should use <i>Levioso</i> to lift the box and then climb on top of it.",
  "playerfemale_35819": "[[He belongs with you.]] I wouldn't keep your Rococo. He needs to be home with you.",
  "playerfemale_35820": "Mr Oakes was lucky. Ranrok's lot would never have freed him.",
  "playerfemale_35821": "Hm – I may have more luck higher up in the keep.",
  "playerfemale_35822": "A ladder – that's what I need.",
  "playerfemale_35823": "Hello, Mr Moon.",
  "playerfemale_35824": "I'm sorry to say, I haven't found any more.",
  "playerfemale_35825": "[[I'll keep looking.]] I'll keep an eye out for more Demiguise statues and see if I can bring you more moons.",
  "playerfemale_35826": "[[Where can I find more moons?]] Where should I look for more Demiguise statues and moons?",
  "playerfemale_35827": "I actually have some moons for you.",
  "playerfemale_35828": "I'm sorry to say that I haven't found any more of those statues.",

  "playerfemale_35830": "[[Where can I find more moons?]] Where should I look for more Demiguise statues and moons?",
  "playerfemale_35831": "What if the choice wasn't yours? You wouldn't be to blame for what happens.",
  "playerfemale_35832": "[[Never mind.]] Now that you say it out loud, it sounds absurd. But I have another idea.",
  "playerfemale_35833": "I'm willing to learn to cast it, Ominis. It may be the only way. But I won't do it unless you agree.",
  "playerfemale_35834": "I know how to cast it. Sebastian taught me. But I won't do it unless you agree.",
  "playerfemale_35836": "I am suggesting we negotiate.",
  "playerfemale_35837": "Sebastian is never going to give up trying to cure Anne. If you try and stop him now, he'll never forgive you.",
  "playerfemale_35838": "Sebastian is never going to give up trying to cure Anne. If you try and stop him now, he'll never forgive you.",
  "playerfemale_35839": "I'm right behind you, Professor. We need help – the sooner the better.",
  "playerfemale_35841": "Inferi? What are you talking about?",
  "playerfemale_35842": "Mr Sallow! Stop!",
  "playerfemale_35843": "It was brave, Sebastian. You clearly care more about Anne than your uncle ever did.",
  "playerfemale_35844": "You did. I would have done the same – if I knew how.",
  "playerfemale_35845": "[[Yes please.]] No time like the present.",
  "playerfemale_35846": "[[Now is not the time.]] Thank you, Sebastian, but perhaps now is not the time.",
  "playerfemale_35847": "I know.",
  "playerfemale_35848": "[[I'm not sure.]] I don't know what to do, Sebastian.",
  "playerfemale_35849": "[[Very well. I'll talk to him.]] Don't worry, Sebastian. I shall speak with Ominis.",
  "playerfemale_35850": "He clearly regrets everything. He's not going to do anything like this again.",
  "playerfemale_35851": "But we also need to think about Anne. She's lost her health – now she's lost her uncle. Do you really want to take her brother away from her too?",
  "playerfemale_35852": "Thank you, Ominis. You're a good friend.",
  "playerfemale_35853": "We've tried to justify his actions every step of the way. But this has gone too far. It has to stop.",
  "playerfemale_35854": "Of course.",
  "playerfemale_35855": "What do you think, Professor?",
  "playerfemale_35856": "Thank you, Professor. For everything.",
  "playerfemale_35857": "What is it, Professor?",
  "playerfemale_35858": "[[How do you know Bubotuber pus will work?]] How on earth did you discover that Bubotuber pus clears one's skin?",

  "playerfemale_35861": "[[What are Bubotubers?]] What precisely are 'Bubotubers'?",
  "playerfemale_35862": "I gave the Horklumps to Mrs Sprottle, but I still need to visit the cave to find Sirona's box of letters.",
  "playerfemale_35863": "Perhaps I'll find more Horklumps while I'm there.",
  "playerfemale_35864": "Best of luck with your potions, Mr Pippin.",
  "playerfemale_35865": "What was it you needed my help with, Samantha?",
  "playerfemale_35866": "I need to find the tomb near Brocburrow and place Samantha's family crest on a sarcophagus there.",
  "playerfemale_35867": "Samantha will be glad to hear that the crest has been returned. I certainly hope it reverses the curse.",
  "playerfemale_35868": "Hello, Imelda. So – another trial?",
  "playerfemale_35869": "[[Strong competition?]] 'Strong competition'? Could that have been a compliment, Imelda?",
  "playerfemale_35870": "I should try and rescue Garnuff's Mooncalf. Sounds as if I'd need to head north to find those poachers.",
  "playerfemale_35871": "[[We shall see, Imelda.]] We'll see, won't we? Till next time.",
  "playerfemale_35872": "[[Who's been 'put out' by your talent?]] You said your reputation for talent put some people out. Like whom?",
  "playerfemale_35873": "I suppose I know what happened to Mary Portman now. She was breeding the spiders.",
  "playerfemale_35874": "That's – actually – thank you?",
  "playerfemale_35876": "This must be Aranshire. I'd best keep an eye out for spiders.",
  "playerfemale_35877": "A ladder. Not sure I want to know where this leads.",
  "playerfemale_35878": "That's the last of the spider sacs.",
  "playerfemale_35879": "I hope that's the last spider.",
  "playerfemale_35880": "Well that's the end of that.",
  "playerfemale_35881": "Here we are. Mr Weekes wasn't wrong about the mountain views.",
  "playerfemale_35883": "[[I'm more ready than ever.]] I'm ready. Thank you, Imelda.",
  "playerfemale_35884": "[[I need to take a moment.]] I think I should have a rest – try again later.",
  "playerfemale_35885": "Imelda Reyes. Are you giving the competition advice?",
  "playerfemale_35888": "[[It's been fun.]] It's been fun competing against your records, Imelda.",
  "playerfemale_35889": "[[Will you keep running the courses?]] Will you keep running these courses?",
  "playerfemale_35890": "[[Competitiveness runs in your family?]] Do you get your competitiveness from your family?",
  "playerfemale_35891": "[[Any plans to play for a Quidditch team?]] I take it you want to play for a team, but which one? And which position?",
  "playerfemale_35892": "This mine must have been abandoned by goblins ages ago.",
  "playerfemale_35893": "[[Very exciting, Mr Weekes. Until then.]] I shall look forward to speaking again.",
  "playerfemale_35894": "[[What will you do from here?]] What will you do after the final upgrade is complete?",
  "playerfemale_35895": "Perhaps a spell would help open this door.",
  "playerfemale_35896": "I might need something that can push a bit harder to open this up.",
  "playerfemale_35897": "[[Bragbor. That name seems familiar.]] Did you say Bragbor? I – I think I know that name.",
  "playerfemale_35898": "Oh, of course! Lodgok said he was an ancestor of Ranrok.",
  "playerfemale_35899": "[[Cladwell and Brewster]] I choose Cladwell and Brewster.",
  "playerfemale_35900": "[[Vesters and Venum]] I choose Vesters and Venum.",
  "playerfemale_35901": "[[Stitches and Draughts]] I choose Stitches and Draughts.",
  "playerfemale_35902": "Thank you. I shall work on collecting items for the shop's inventory.",
  "playerfemale_35903": "Oh, and Penny? We'll be closing the shop by nine o'clock every night.",
  "playerfemale_35904": "Can't help but admire Mr Weekes's enthusiasm.",
  "playerfemale_35905": "This book contains potion recipes.",
  "playerfemale_35907": "I have the Niffler. Now to look for the Haggarty family heirloom.",
  "playerfemale_35908": "I wonder how Mr Haggarty will take this news? His sister wasn't the thief and his heirloom's coming home.",
  "playerfemale_35909": "Imelda certainly is strong competition.",
  "playerfemale_35910": "That went rather well.",
  "playerfemale_35912": "I'm getting a knack for these time trials.",
  "playerfemale_35913": "Mr Weekes and I do make a good team.",
  "playerfemale_35914": "The course looks rather deserted. I hope everything's all right.",
  "playerfemale_35915": "Perhaps I could test out my new upgrade on the way.",
  "playerfemale_35916": "Wasn't hoping for that. Not to worry.",
  "playerfemale_35917": "That was quite something.",
  "playerfemale_35918": "Good for Mr Weekes.",
  "playerfemale_35919": "Made it.",
  "playerfemale_35920": "Brilliant flying, if I do say so myself.",
  "playerfemale_35921": "That wasn't too difficult.",
  "playerfemale_35922": "This is going well.",

  "playerfemale_35925": "No success there.",
  "playerfemale_35926": "Blast.",
  "playerfemale_35927": "I'm getting the hang of this.",
  "playerfemale_35928": "Made it.",
  "playerfemale_35929": "I'd say that was acceptable.",
  "playerfemale_35930": "Brilliant.",
  "playerfemale_35931": "Close, but not close enough.",
  "playerfemale_35932": "Missed it.",

  "playerfemale_35934": "Blast.",
  "playerfemale_35935": "This is rather fun.",
  "playerfemale_35936": "Success!",
  "playerfemale_35937": "Did it.",
  "playerfemale_35938": "Made it.",
  "playerfemale_35939": "Could've done better.",
  "playerfemale_35940": "Missed one.",
  "playerfemale_35941": "(sigh)",
  "playerfemale_35942": "This'll take some getting used to.",
  "playerfemale_35943": "[[They don't scare me.]] I'm not worried, Mr Weekes. I'll see if I can find Imelda.",
  "playerfemale_35944": "But with the speeds it now reaches, I can feel the wind catching beneath the seat a bit, preventing it from reaching its full potential.",
  "playerfemale_35945": "I will say that it tended to drift a bit to the left on certain turns. Heard a slight 'swoosh' when I dipped.",
  "playerfemale_35947": "Sebastian. I can't imagine what you – and Anne – are going through. Perhaps you'll hear from her soon.",
  "playerfemale_35949": "The rumours are true and I did, but it's not that. Just before Rookwood attacked, he uttered something familiar.",
  "playerfemale_35950": "The same words Anne heard before she was cursed: children should be seen and not heard.",
  "playerfemale_35951": "It wasn't one of Ranrok's Loyalists who cursed Anne. It was Rookwood. It was Rookwood all along.",
  "playerfemale_35953": "Ominis – there's something I need to tell you. It's to do with Victor Rookwood.",
  "playerfemale_35955": "The rumour's true and I did. But, it's not that. Just before Rookwood attacked, he uttered something familiar –",
  "playerfemale_35956": "It wasn't one of Ranrok's Loyalists who cursed Anne. It was Victor Rookwood. It was Rookwood all along.",
  "playerfemale_35957": "Sebastian, I received your owl. What's happened?",
  "playerfemale_35959": "Ominis, I received your owl. What's happened with Sebastian?",
  "playerfemale_35961": "I wonder why? Good day Madam Kogawa.",
  "playerfemale_35962": "Once Rookwood allied with Ranrok, Isidora's estate became of interest to them both.",
  "playerfemale_35963": "That's why Rookwood was there the night Anne was cursed. He was working with Ranrok. When he saw your sister – well, he didn't want anyone to know – ",
  "playerfemale_35964": "– the same words Anne heard before she was cursed: children should be seen and not heard.",
  "playerfemale_35965": "I suppose that makes sense.",
  "playerfemale_35967": "[[It takes some getting used to.]]It does take a while to adjust to being here.",
  "playerfemale_35968": "[[It's a shame people weren't kinder.]]I'm sorry the other students weren't more friendly.",
  "playerfemale_35969": "Was it Sirona Ryan?",
  "playerfemale_35970": "How fortunate.",
  "playerfemale_35971": "Sirona has been a good friend to me as well. In fact, I retrieved a box of letters from Mrs Sprottle for her.",
  "playerfemale_35975": "You see – since Feldcroft was of interest to Ranrok, it became of interest to Rookwood as well.",
  "playerfemale_35976": "That's why Rookwood was there the night Anne was cursed. He was working with Ranrok. When he saw Anne – well, he didn't want anyone to know – ",
  "playerfemale_35977": "[[Perhaps Anne will come around.]] Anne may just need some time. Surely one day she'll be able to forgive you.",
  "playerfemale_35979": "I'm so sorry. But I'm glad to know that you can at least try to move on now.",
  "playerfemale_35980": "[[Anne may never forgive you.]] Sebastian, I'm afraid Anne may never be able to forgive you. But at least now you have a chance to change your path.",
  "playerfemale_35981": "Well, it wasn't easy. But I believe in you, Sebastian. I've had a sense about you since that first day in Defence Against the Dark Arts.",
  "playerfemale_35982": "[[I know what you mean.]] I never thought things would end this way. I hope we did the right thing.",
  "playerfemale_35983": "[[He deserves to be punished.]] Sebastian brought all of this on himself. We tried and tried to stop him.",
  "playerfemale_35984": "Were you able to tell Sebastian about Rookwood cursing Anne?",
  "playerfemale_35985": "I'm glad to hear it. She deserves peace.",
  "playerfemale_35986": "Sebastian – there's something you should know. It's to do with Victor Rookwood.",
  "playerfemale_35987": "Professor, do you have a moment?",
  "playerfemale_35988": "Professor, I wondered – did you attend Hogwarts?",
  "playerfemale_35989": "[[Did you attend Hogwarts?]] I wondered – did you attend Hogwarts?",
  "playerfemale_35990": "[[Never mind.]] Actually, perhaps another time.",
  "playerfemale_35991": "You have. Thank you for speaking with me, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_35992": "[[How fascinating.]] Time itself? I never would have imagined such a thing.",
  "playerfemale_35993": "I was curious as to how Hogwarts has changed over the years.",
  "playerfemale_35994": "[[How awful.]] I'm not sure what that means – but it sounds – horrible.",
  "playerfemale_35995": "An 'Unspeakable'? What does – ",
  "playerfemale_35996": "I – I hadn't realised that you and Professor Black were, er, students here together.",
  "playerfemale_35997": "Professor, could you spare a moment?",
  "playerfemale_35998": "Yes, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_35999": "Professor, what can you tell me about your work at the Ministry?",
  "playerfemale_36000": "[[Can you say anything about your work at the Ministry?]]Professor, what can you tell me about your work at the Ministry?",
  "playerfemale_36001": "[[Never mind.]]I'm sorry. It's nothing, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_36002": "If I may, Professor, I'm also happy that you're here at Hogwarts now.",
  "playerfemale_36003": "Yes, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_36004": "[[That's a sensible way to look at things.]] You do seem to have come to terms with things rather well.",
  "playerfemale_36005": "[[How have you dealt with the time you've lost?]] Have you made peace with the time you've lost?",
  "playerfemale_36006": "Professor, do you have a moment?",

  "playerfemale_36008": "[[How did you come to be at Hogwarts?]] I wondered if I could ask you how you came to Hogwarts?",
  "playerfemale_36009": "[[Never mind.]] Apologies, Professor. I have nothing to ask.",
  "playerfemale_36010": "Professor Weasley was a curse breaker for the Ministry?",
  "playerfemale_36011": "Then you enjoy being a Flying instructor – even after all that happened?",
  "playerfemale_36013": "[[How could you leave your home?]] Wasn't it difficult to leave your home?",
  "playerfemale_36014": "[[I understand wanting to leave your past.]] I suppose I can understand wanting to move on from all that you went through with the Tengu.",
  "playerfemale_36015": "What do we have here?",
  "playerfemale_36016": "[[What else can you share about brooms?]]Do you mind sharing more about your brooms?",
  "playerfemale_36017": "Professor, do you have a moment?",
  "playerfemale_36018": "I see. Natty told me that you and she moved here from Uganda, where she had attended Uagadou.",
  "playerfemale_36019": "Professor, how did you come to teach Divination?",
  "playerfemale_36020": "[[How did you come to teach Divination?]]I was wondering how you decided to teach Divination?",
  "playerfemale_36021": "Of course, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_36022": "[[Never mind.]]I'm sorry. It seems now isn't the best time after all.",
  "playerfemale_36023": "[[I find it all fascinating.]]I find it truly intriguing, even if I don't fully understand it.",
  "playerfemale_36024": "[[It seems – hard to believe.]]I'm not sure I believe that one can really see the future.",
  "playerfemale_36034": "Professor, may I have a moment of your time?",
  "playerfemale_36035": "Professor, could you tell me how you and Natty ended up at Hogwarts?",
  "playerfemale_36036": "[[How did you and Natty end up at Hogwarts?]]Professor, could you tell me how you and Natty ended up at Hogwarts?",
  "playerfemale_36037": "[[Never mind.]]Apologies, Professor. Perhaps another time.",
  "playerfemale_36038": "[[I'm not surprised.]]Professor Weasley seems quite knowledgeable, so I'm not surprised to hear that she'd do that sort of thing.",
  "playerfemale_36039": "Natty has spoken of your move. She was quite kind to me my first day here, in Charms.",
  "playerfemale_36040": "You knew Professor Weasley when you were in Uganda?",
  "playerfemale_36041": "I see.",
  "playerfemale_36042": "[[You can't be serious.]]I confess that I'm surprised to hear Professor Weasley would ever do that sort of thing.",
  "playerfemale_36043": "Professor, might I have a moment?",
  "playerfemale_36044": "Professor, what inspired your interest in magical beasts?",
  "playerfemale_36045": "[[Why are you interested in magical beasts?]]I was wondering what inspired your interest in magical beasts.",
  "playerfemale_36046": "Of course, Professor. When did your path become clear?",
  "playerfemale_36047": "[[Possibly. I find magical beasts fascinating.]]I haven't decided quite yet, but I do find magical beasts fascinating.",
  "playerfemale_36048": "[[I am not.]]Truthfully, I am not. But I am interested to know why you chose this path for yourself.",
  "playerfemale_36049": "[[Never mind.]]Apologies, Professor. Perhaps later.",
  "playerfemale_36050": "I shall remember that, Professor. Thank you.",
  "playerfemale_36051": "What did you do with them?",
  "playerfemale_36052": "[[What is an Occamy?]] What type of beast is an Occamy?",
  "playerfemale_36053": "That sounds incredible.",
  "playerfemale_36054": "[[Finding an Occamy sounds challenging.]] Seems quite a challenge, finding an Occamy in the mountains.",
  "playerfemale_36055": "Professor, do you have a moment?",
  "playerfemale_36056": "Professor, may I ask what interested you about Astronomy?",
  "playerfemale_36057": "[[Why an interest in Astronomy?]] May I ask what attracted you to Astronomy?",
  "playerfemale_36058": "[[Never mind.]] Apologies, Professor. Perhaps later.",
  "playerfemale_36059": "[[How unfortunate.]] Your poor sister. What an unfortunate situation for your family.",
  "playerfemale_36060": "[[Not at all. I find it fascinating.]] Oh, not at all, Professor. I find it intriguing and wanted to know more about your work.",
  "playerfemale_36061": "Thank you for telling me about your sister, Professor.",
  "playerfemale_36062": "[[A little. I wonder as to its relevance.]] Apologies, Professor. I suppose I do wonder about its relevance to us.",
  "playerfemale_36063": "[[She's sounds lovely.]] It sounds as if she's a lovely person; and accomplished.",
  "playerfemale_36064": "I'm not sure I follow, Professor. Why was that?",
  "playerfemale_36065": "I need to look for a unicorn with a beautifully bright coat. It sounds as if she's in trouble.",
  "playerfemale_36066": "That unicorn has an exceptionally bright coat. It must be Hazel.",
  "playerfemale_36067": "Come on, Hazel.",
  "playerfemale_36068": "I can take Hazel back to a vivarium now. I should let Madam Bugbrooke know she's safe.",
  "playerfemale_36079": "Professor!",
  "playerfemale_36081": "(yells)",
  "playerfemale_36082": "(yells) (struggles)",

  "playerfemale_36084": "(resolute yell)",
  "playerfemale_36085": "(yells) (struggles)",
  "playerfemale_36087": "[[What was in the box of letters?]] Do you remember anything about the letters you put in the box?",
  "playerfemale_36088": "I should dismount here.",
  "playerfemale_36089": "It seems to have worked.",
  "playerfemale_36090": "[[I can't wait to start classes.]] I'm looking forward to meeting my professors and learning all I can at Hogwarts.",
  "playerfemale_36091": "[[I can't wait to explore.]] I'm looking forward to exploring Hogwarts and the world beyond the castle and grounds.",
  "playerfemale_36092": "[[Daring.]] A sense of adventure? I like to think that I'm not afraid of anything.",
  "playerfemale_36093": "[[Curiosity.]] A desire to learn? I do enjoy a good puzzle. And I believe I have a ready mind.",
  "playerfemale_36094": "[[Loyalty.]] A sense of loyalty? I believe myself to be a true friend. I know I value that trait in others.",
  "playerfemale_36095": "[[Ambition.]] Is it ambition? I may seem single-minded, but it is important to go after what you want from life.",
  "playerfemale_36096": "Amit – could I ask you something?",
  "playerfemale_36097": "[[Where is this table?]] Where, precisely, is the table we're looking for?",
  "playerfemale_36098": "[[Why the fascination with stars?]] Why are you so fascinated with stars?",
  "playerfemale_36099": "Actually, that's all I wanted to know.",
  "playerfemale_36100": "Hmm. Only two lanterns – but three spots. Perhaps I should move them around to open the door and build the platform.",
  "playerfemale_36101": "Perhaps I should pull the lantern into this room to cause the room to rotate again.",
  "playerfemale_36103": "Is that how he found this place?",
  "playerfemale_36104": "Why can I see the weapon but not the statue that's wielding it?",
  "playerfemale_36105": "Perhaps I need to be on the same side of the arch as the statue to see him.",
  "playerfemale_36106": "Hard to say from up here. Let's get a better lay of the land.",
  "playerfemale_36107": "Are those dragons?",
  "playerfemale_36137": "Highwing! – go!",
  "playerfemale_36138": "Faster, Highwing!",
  "playerfemale_36139": "Away, Highwing! Away!",
  "playerfemale_36140": "Let's go! Come on, Highwing!",
  "playerfemale_36141": "Good girl, Highwing.",
  "playerfemale_36142": "You're a loyal girl, Highwing.",
  "playerfemale_36143": "Faster!",
  "playerfemale_36144": "Time to go a little quicker.",
  "playerfemale_36145": "You certainly are a magnificent beast.",
  "playerfemale_36146": "Glad I have you here.",
  "playerfemale_36147": "Faster!",
  "playerfemale_36148": "What say we pick up the pace a bit?",
  "playerfemale_36149": "Here we go.",
  "playerfemale_36150": "Slow down, now. There we go.",
  "playerfemale_36151": "No need to race now, my friend.",
  "playerfemale_36152": "Time for a jaunt, I'd say.",
  "playerfemale_36153": "How about some sightseeing?",
  "playerfemale_36154": "Ah, there you are.",
  "playerfemale_36155": "Highwing!",
  "playerfemale_36156": "We make a grand pair, Highwing.",
  "playerfemale_36157": "There's a friendly face.",
  "playerfemale_36158": "No need to be difficult. I mean you no harm.",
  "playerfemale_36159": "Oh no you don't.",
  "playerfemale_36160": "Now, now. I'm only trying to help.",
  "playerfemale_36161": "Do cooperate, won't you?",
  "playerfemale_36162": "That wasn't so difficult.",
  "playerfemale_36163": "If only Professor Fig could have seen that.",
  "playerfemale_36164": "Shame I didn't have an audience for that one.",
  "playerfemale_36165": "That solves that.",
  "playerfemale_36166": "That wasn't too hard.",
  "playerfemale_36167": "Professor Howin will never believe this.",
  "playerfemale_36168": "I'll look after you.",
  "playerfemale_36169": "Settle yourself. I mean you no harm.",
  "playerfemale_36170": "Everything's all right now.",
  "playerfemale_36171": "There, there. I'm not going to hurt you.",
  "playerfemale_36172": "The beasts are safer now.",
  "playerfemale_36173": "The beasts around here can sleep a bit easier now.",
  "playerfemale_36174": "Your poaching days are over.",
  "playerfemale_36175": "It's shameful what you've done to helpless beasts.",
  "playerfemale_36176": "One less poacher in the wizarding world.",
  "playerfemale_36177": "You only have Ranrok to blame.",
  "playerfemale_36178": "Ranrok has fooled you all, to your demise.",
  "playerfemale_36179": "Your blood's on Ranrok's hands.",
  "playerfemale_36180": "Too late for you to learn the error of your ways.",
  "playerfemale_36181": "You've one less follower, Ranrok.",
  "playerfemale_36182": "Eight legs is simply too many.",
  "playerfemale_36183": "Ugh. Shame you're so foul.",
  "playerfemale_36184": "Not my fault you're a deadly great spider.",
  "playerfemale_36185": "Cursed fiends.",
  "playerfemale_36186": "There's a victory that came none too soon. Ugh.",
  "playerfemale_36187": "Rest easy, my large friend.",
  "playerfemale_36188": "One less foul hulking brute.",
  "playerfemale_36189": "Should think they felt that in London.",
  "playerfemale_36190": "That was a close one.",
  "playerfemale_36191": "Now here's a welcoming sight.",
  "playerfemale_36192": "I hope I look this good when I'm nine hundred years old.",
  "playerfemale_36193": "And the whole world awaits.",
  "playerfemale_36194": "Where to next?",
  "playerfemale_36195": "I'll be back here soon enough.",
  "playerfemale_36196": "Who'd think an enormous castle could feel like home?",
  "playerfemale_36197": "Back to Hogwarts. Wonder if they've missed me?",
  "playerfemale_36198": "Never thought I'd feel so comforted to see this place.",
  "playerfemale_36199": "This place stinks of Ranrok and his cronies.",
  "playerfemale_36200": "There could be goblin Loyalists in here.",
  "playerfemale_36201": "Wonder if Ranrok and his crew are in there?",
  "playerfemale_36202": "Could be some of Ranrok's Loyalists in there. Best be careful.",
  "playerfemale_36203": "This mine could be hiding a secret – Ranrok and his Loyalists.",
  "playerfemale_36204": "Mine now, Demiguise.",
  "playerfemale_36205": "What do we have here? A Demiguise.",
  "playerfemale_36206": "Here's one of those tables Professor Shah mentioned.",
  "playerfemale_36207": "Knowing Amit, he's likely studied here.",
  "playerfemale_36208": "An Astronomy Table. Should prove useful once the sun's down.",
  "playerfemale_36209": "Likely this Astronomy Table will be best used when it's dark.",
  "playerfemale_36210": "Perhaps not the best place to be caught alone.",
  "playerfemale_36211": "This looks like trouble.",
  "playerfemale_36212": "Goodness. Not a party to attend by myself.",
  "playerfemale_36213": "I don't like the looks of that encampment.",
  "playerfemale_36214": "Trouble's brewing, and I'm without my friends.",
  "playerfemale_36215": "Hm. Not the best place for an unaccompanied student.",
  "playerfemale_36216": "Glad I was never locked up here.",
  "playerfemale_36217": "What went on here, I wonder?",
  "playerfemale_36218": "Stone walls do a prison make, sometimes.",
  "playerfemale_36219": "Now here's a sad looking place.",
  "playerfemale_36220": "This castle's hiding all sorts of secrets.",
  "playerfemale_36221": "There's no telling what lies in wait for me in there.",
  "playerfemale_36222": "Wonder if I'm safe to explore in there.",
  "playerfemale_36223": "Mysterious and a bit unsettling. What to do?",
  "playerfemale_36224": "Looks rather dark in there. Never stopped me before.",
  "playerfemale_36225": "Who lived here, I wonder?",
  "playerfemale_36226": "Abandoned long ago no doubt.",
  "playerfemale_36227": "This place has seen better days.",
  "playerfemale_36228": "A castle. Must have been quite stately in its time.",
  "playerfemale_36229": "These rocks have seen better days.",
  "playerfemale_36230": "Could it be? A Merlin Trial?",
  "playerfemale_36231": "I know a Merlin Trial when I see one.",
  "playerfemale_36232": "Oho, here's a pleasant surprise.",
  "playerfemale_36233": "Let's see what's up your sleeve this time, Merlin.",
  "playerfemale_36234": "I know what that means. Merlin Trial.",
  "playerfemale_36235": "What do you have in store for me this time?",
  "playerfemale_36236": "Hm. Seems a pleasant enough little place.",
  "playerfemale_36237": "Wonder who lives here?",
  "playerfemale_36238": "Not sure how I'd fare in a little place like this.",
  "playerfemale_36239": "It's like a place right out of a story book.",
  "playerfemale_36240": "Seems I'm ill-prepared.",
  "playerfemale_36241": "Hm. Out of Wiggenweld Potions.",
  "playerfemale_36242": "Never good to be caught with no Wiggenweld Potion.",
  "playerfemale_36243": "Ugh. Empty.",
  "playerfemale_36244": "Professor Sharp'll never let me live this down.",
  "playerfemale_36245": "Nothing to identify, for now at least.",
  "playerfemale_36246": "This will be more useful when I have something to identify.",
  "playerfemale_36247": "I don't have anything for this at the moment.",
  "playerfemale_36248": "This looks intriguing.",
  "playerfemale_36249": "I should investigate.",
  "playerfemale_36250": "This could prove dangerous if I'm not careful.",
  "playerfemale_36251": "Nobody'll believe I defeated an Ashwinder by myself.",
  "playerfemale_36252": "And no one to share in my victory.",
  "playerfemale_36253": "Wait till Sebastian hears about this. An Ashwinder.",
  "playerfemale_36254": "I did it. And an Ashwinder, no less.",
  "playerfemale_36255": "Shame nobody saw that.",
  "playerfemale_36256": "Sometimes it seems all roads lead to Hogsmeade.",
  "playerfemale_36257": "Hogsmeade, here I come.",
  "playerfemale_36258": "Does it get any more cosy than Hogsmeade?",
  "playerfemale_36259": "Merlin himself would be proud.",
  "playerfemale_36260": "These Merlin Trials won't get the best of me.",
  "playerfemale_36261": "That's that – settled.",
  "playerfemale_36262": "Not so tricky after all, Merlin.",
  "playerfemale_36263": "Not quite ready yet.",
  "playerfemale_36264": "Seems I'll need to wait.",
  "playerfemale_36265": "Hm. Too soon for that it seems.",
  "playerfemale_36266": "I need to wait.",
  "playerfemale_36267": "Hm. Hopefully not much longer.",
  "playerfemale_36268": "That's all for now. Don't go too far.",
  "playerfemale_36269": "I'll see you again soon enough, I'm sure.",
  "playerfemale_36270": "Mind yourself while I'm gone.",
  "playerfemale_36271": "You can have a rest now.",
  "playerfemale_36272": "Wow! Now to see things from above for a bit.",
  "playerfemale_36273": "This will be a welcome change.",
  "playerfemale_36274": "Nothing like a broom to feel free.",
  "playerfemale_36275": "Down to earth again.",
  "playerfemale_36276": "That's all the flying for now.",
  "playerfemale_36277": "And to think Muggles only use these for sweeping.",
  "playerfemale_36278": "No flying here, I see.",
  "playerfemale_36279": "Wait till the birds hear about the flying ban.",
  "playerfemale_36280": "No use trying to fly here.",
  "playerfemale_36281": "Not the best idea to fly around here.",
  "playerfemale_36282": "Time to change course.",
  "playerfemale_36283": "I'll need to dismount if I keep going that way.",
  "playerfemale_36284": "No flying allowed here.",
  "playerfemale_36285": "This is no place for flying.",
  "playerfemale_36286": "Seems I can't fly here. Wonder whose decision that was.",
  "playerfemale_36287": "What could this be?",
  "playerfemale_36288": "Here's an odd find.",
  "playerfemale_36289": "Hm, what's this?",
  "playerfemale_36290": "Whatever this is, it may prove useful.",
  "playerfemale_36291": "This might be something to keep.",
  "playerfemale_36292": "I know a den of beasts when I smell one.",
  "playerfemale_36293": "Here's hoping the residents aren't too ferocious.",
  "playerfemale_36294": "Hopefully they've had a good meal.",
  "playerfemale_36295": "Ah, my very own Room of Requirement.",
  "playerfemale_36296": "What do I require this time, o wondrous space?",
  "playerfemale_36297": "Who says wishes don't come true.",
  "playerfemale_36298": "The most magical place in all of Hogwarts.",
  "playerfemale_36299": "Time to see what new secrets await.",
  "playerfemale_36300": "What a wonderful place.",
  "playerfemale_36301": "Simply marvellous.",
  "playerfemale_36302": "Who could wish to see anything more incredible.",
  "playerfemale_36303": "I've run out of plants. Curses.",
  "playerfemale_36304": "Not a single plant to my name.",
  "playerfemale_36305": "It would have been nice to have some plants on hand  – but I have nothing.",
  "playerfemale_36306": "Here's a lost page.",
  "playerfemale_36307": "My Field Guide's going to be glad to see this.",
  "playerfemale_36308": "Another page.",
  "playerfemale_36309": "The Field Guide's getting a bit more complete.",
  "playerfemale_36310": "One page at a time.",
  "playerfemale_36311": "I know what this is. A page for my Field Guide.",
  "playerfemale_36312": "And one for you, Professor Weasley.",
  "playerfemale_36313": "I'll put you back where you belong. In my Field Guide.",
  "playerfemale_36314": "Another page for my Field Guide. Brilliant.",
  "playerfemale_36315": "That's no ordinary sheet of paper.",
  "playerfemale_36316": "Here's a page that's come out of my Field Guide.",
  "playerfemale_36317": "You'll be back in my Field Guide in no time.",
  "playerfemale_36318": "One more page for my Field Guide. Very good.",
  "playerfemale_36319": "You're not lost any more, little page.",
  "playerfemale_36320": "Into my Field Guide with you.",
  "playerfemale_36321": "I know just where to put you. In my Field Guide.",
  "playerfemale_36322": "It's not a complete guide without you.",
  "playerfemale_36323": "My collection of Field Guide Pages is coming along.",
  "playerfemale_36324": "A page. To my Field Guide.",
  "playerfemale_36325": "I've found another page for my Field Guide.",
  "playerfemale_36326": "A flying key!",
  "playerfemale_36327": "Is that one of those keys?",
  "playerfemale_36328": "I see you, little flying key.",
  "playerfemale_36329": "Excellent. Shan't mention this to the prefects.",
  "playerfemale_36330": "That house chest will be open in no time.",
  "playerfemale_36331": "I know where this goes. The house chest.",
  "playerfemale_36332": "Ruins. What mysteries lie beyond your walls, I wonder?",
  "playerfemale_36333": "How old must those ruins be?",
  "playerfemale_36334": "Whoever built you didn't account for weather.",
  "playerfemale_36335": "I suppose that's off limits.",
  "playerfemale_36336": "I'd better not let Madam Scribner see me trying to get in here.",
  "playerfemale_36337": "I still have the key.",
  "playerfemale_36338": "The key will help me get back in here.",
  "playerfemale_36339": "Penny. Please stop holding your breath.  Tell me what's going on.",
  "playerfemale_36340": "But, how can you be forbidden from telling me what's going on? I purchased this shop. I – ",
  "playerfemale_36341": "And, according to the house-elf that came with the shop, she has done this sort of thing before. Repeatedly.",
  "playerfemale_36342": "Penny, I have what I hope will be good news. Officer Singer confirmed that ownership of the shop has now transferred to me.",
  "playerfemale_36343": "I enjoyed that.",
  "playerfemale_36344": "Has this been under the Headmaster's nose all this time?",
  "playerfemale_36346": "It seems that a lot of beasts have been more aggressive than usual lately.",
  "playerfemale_36348": "They can't see me at all. I can get closer to them.",
  "playerfemale_36349": "That's the way forward.",
  "playerfemale_36350": "That's where I need to go, but I need to find a way past them.",
  "playerfemale_36351": "(belch)",
  "playerfemale_36352": "(belch)",

  "playermale_13418": "[[I'll see what I can find out.]] I could look into the matter for you.",
  "playermale_13431": "Sir – are you all right? You seem to be in some distress?",
  "playermale_13635": "What was it you needed, Mr Pratt?",
  "playermale_13636": "I'm a friend of Adelaide's. She was worried about your business with Ranrok's Loyalists.",
  "playermale_13690": "Calm down. I'm here now.",
  "playermale_13691": "[[I could take you to the Hog's Head instead.]] What if I took you to the Hog's Head instead? I've heard such nice things.",
  "playermale_13693": "[[Let's get out of here.]] Let's get out of here then, shall we?",
  "playermale_14846": "Excuse me, sir. Are you all right?",
  "playermale_15059": "[[Why have spiders taken over the hamlet?]] Why are there so many spiders in Aranshire all of a sudden?",
  "playermale_15060": "[[Why didn't you contact the authorities?]] Why didn't you ask the Ministry for help?",
  "playermale_15061": "Mr Dunne? About the spider problem in Aranshire –",
  "playermale_15111": "Mr Dunne? I have some news.",
  "playermale_18372": "[[About the Owlery –]] Sir, do you think the culprit who stole your family wand may have taken it to the Owlery?",
  "playermale_18840": "I'd like to ask you about changing the Room's ambiance.",
  "playermale_18841": "[[A cool, moonlit ambience sounds perfect.]] I would like the Room to feel as if it's being lit by the moon.",
  "playermale_18842": "[[I'd like something natural and earthy.]] I'd like the Room to feel natural and earthy, as though I'm outdoors.",
  "playermale_18843": "[[I'd like it to feel warm and cosy.]] I'd like the Room to be warm and comfortable – as if I'm floating inside a mug of Butterbeer.",
  "playermale_18844": "[[Never mind.]] Actually, perhaps another time.",
  "playermale_18845": "[[I focus best in a room that is dark and mysterious.]] I'd like the Room to feel mysterious and eerie, as if I'm in the Forbidden Forest, surrounded by shadows.",
  "playermale_19328": "[[Where was I going?]] Where did you want me to go?",
  "playermale_19343": "Are you Anne?",
  "playermale_19733": "Are you certain you can't make do with one frame?",
  "playermale_19735": "[[You're so obnoxious.]] You're quite an obnoxious chap, aren't you? There's no need to get your pantaloons in a twist.",
  "playermale_19736": "[[I'm sorry to offend you.]] I apologise. I didn't mean to offend you.",
  "playermale_19828": "Well, I've done it, Penny. The shop is mine.",
  "playermale_19830": "I'm glad you're here to help me.",
  "playermale_19831": "[[No time like the present.]] Well then – let's get to it.",
  "playermale_19835": "Hello – Madam Mason? I understand you have a shop to sell.",
  "playermale_19836": "[[I might be.]] Perhaps. It depends upon your terms.",
  "playermale_19837": "[[I am, indeed.]] Yes, I am. I've always wanted to own a shop.",
  "playermale_19839": "Madam Mason? About the shop –",
  "playermale_19840": "[[Why is the shop empty?]] The shop seems to be in an ideal location. Why has no one purchased it yet?",
  "playermale_19841": "[[What represents failure?]] What precisely do you mean, should my 'efforts fail'?",
  "playermale_19844": "I've decided I'd like to go ahead and purchase the shop.",
  "playermale_19847": "[[Of course I'm back.]] Were you worried I might not return?",
  "playermale_19851": "[[Thank you for telling me what you could.]] Thank you, Penny. I think I'm going to need to talk to the authorities.",
  "playermale_19853": "[[I enjoy a good challenge.]] I must say, I enjoy a good challenge.",
  "playermale_19854": "[[You call that fun?]] I wouldn't call it 'fun', really.",
  "playermale_19856": "So, about that contract –",
  "playermale_19858": "[[What are the terms?]] Just to be clear, what does this agreement entail – specifically?",
  "playermale_19859": "[[What's in it for you?]] Why would you enter into such an agreement?",
  "playermale_19862": "[[I'm not sure I'd like a shop.]] Even with your help, I'm not certain it would be worth it. Shopkeeping has never really appealed to me.",
  "playermale_19863": "[[My own shop and elf would be brilliant.]] Oh, it would be wonderful to have a place to sell things and someone to help me.",
  "playermale_19864": "[[I'll talk to your mistress.]] All right. I shall go and find Madam Mason.",
  "playermale_19865": "[[What could I sell?]] What kind of things would I be able to sell in the shop?",
  "playermale_19871": "It's my pleasure. You deserve it.",
  "playermale_20041": "I am indeed a student, but I could very well be able to help you.",
  "playermale_21626": "One more thing, Penny.",
  "playermale_21859": "[[She was an innocent victim.]] I'm so sorry, Mr Dunne. She was an innocent victim.",
  "playermale_21861": "[[She was the victim of her own greed.]] It seems poor Mary was breeding spiders in her home for profit – and vastly underestimated their propensity to multiply.",
  "playermale_22313": "[[I'm ready to go.]] I'm eager to get to Hogsmeade.",
  "playermale_22320": "[[So there really is an Ollivanders here?]] There's an Ollivanders in Hogsmeade?",
  "playermale_22336": "[[Let's talk to the centaurs.]] Sounds as if we need to go and talk to the centaurs.",
  "playermale_22349": "[[I'm glad you understand.]] That's good to hear. It's a lot to take in all at once.",
  "playermale_22353": "Professor, what should I be doing again?",
  "playermale_22356": "[[Why not keep the egg?]] I don't suppose you've thought about keeping it, have you?",
  "playermale_22359": "Are you in some sort of trouble?",
  "playermale_22360": "[[Of course.]] Yes! I have some right here. Please, take it. And be careful.",
  "playermale_22361": "[[I don't have any.]] I'm afraid not. I'd help you if I could, but I don’t actually have anything with me.",
  "playermale_22362": "[[I don't believe you need it.]] You should be able to take care of yourself. I’m not giving you anything.",
  "playermale_22363": "Still looking for that Thunderbrew?",
  "playermale_22386": "[[That sounds simple enough.]] That sounds straightforward enough.",
  "playermale_22388": "[[This seems dangerous.]] You're making this sound simple. But, this is a dragon after all.",
  "playermale_22418": "[[I'm holding my own.]] Thank you, but I've been holding my own.",
  "playermale_22439": "[[Yes, Gryffindor.]] Yes!",
  "playermale_22440": "[[Yes, Ravenclaw.]] Yes! Ravenclaw is correct.",
  "playermale_22441": "[[Yes, Hufflepuff.]] Yes!",
  "playermale_22442": "[[Yes, Slytherin.]] Yes!",
  "playermale_22443": "[[I belong in Gryffindor.]] I believe that Gryffindor is a better fit for me.",
  "playermale_22444": "[[I belong in Ravenclaw.]] I'm certain that Ravenclaw is the house for me.",
  "playermale_22445": "[[I belong in Hufflepuff.]] Hufflepuff would be a better fit for me.",
  "playermale_22446": "[[I belong in Slytherin.]] I am certain that I belong in Slytherin house.",
  "playermale_22450": "Nice to meet you as well, Professor.",
  "playermale_22452": "Thank you, Professor Weasley.",
  "playermale_22453": "Thank you, Professor Weasley.",
  "playermale_22454": "Thank you, Professor Weasley.",
  "playermale_22455": "Thank you, Professor Weasley.",
  "playermale_22461": "[[Where precisely are we taking the egg?]] If you're right about finding her here, how do we go about returning the egg?",
  "playermale_22477": "[[Why is this helmet valuable?]] What about this helmet makes it so special?",
  "playermale_22495": "[[Do your parents know that you sabotage poachers?]] Do your parents know about the things you do now? Saving that dragon from the fighting ring, for instance?",
  "playermale_22496": "[[How awful for you.]] Merlin – I don't know what to say, Poppy. I can't imagine what that must have been like for you.",
  "playermale_22595": "[[We're ready.]] Amit and I can do this.",
  "playermale_22598": "[[Can you tell me more about the door?]] What else should we know about the enchanted door?",
  "playermale_22599": "What are Amit and I to do again?",
  "playermale_22620": "Drills, Lodgok. They're building enormous drills.",
  "playermale_22638": "[[Let's find the Snidgets.]] If you're right about this place, then we should make our way there.",
  "playermale_22654": "Do they always talk to you like that?",
  "playermale_22655": "Don't forget why I'm here, sir.",
  "playermale_22680": "Lodgok – what should we do about the helmet thieves?",
  "playermale_22681": "The moths match the shapes I saw on the door.",
  "playermale_22709": "[[Wait. Why am I here?]] Feenky, isn't it? I know I came in here for something. What was it?",
  "playermale_22747": "[[Of course.]] I can take the crest to Marmaduke's sarcophagus for you.",
  "playermale_22749": "[[Where did the curse come from?]] Why was Marmaduke's tomb cursed?",
  "playermale_22791": "Hello, Mr Dibble. I had a few more questions, if you don't mind.",
  "playermale_22803": "[[About the note –]] Could you give me a bit more detail about the note – that might help me to identify it should I come across it?",
  "playermale_22805": "[[Mr Hill seems a fair man. Can you tell him?]] I met Mr Hill the day of the troll attack. He was kind to me. Why don't you just tell him?",
  "playermale_22808": "Mrs Rabe, I have a few more questions if you don't mind.",
  "playermale_22830": "Mr Philbert? I have your book.",
  "playermale_22832": "[[I'm glad.]] I'm glad to have been of help.",
  "playermale_22840": "[[How is your mother doing?]] What does your mother think about all of this?",
  "playermale_22848": "Hello, Mrs Rabe. How is Mr Rabe doing?",
  "playermale_22849": "[[He's lucky.]] He's lucky I found him in time.",
  "playermale_22872": "So what is it you've been looking for?",
  "playermale_22879": "[[Don't get into trouble.]] Wait, I don't want you getting into trouble for me.",
  "playermale_22880": "[[Can I trust you?]] How do I know you won’t go to the librarian and blame this all on me?",
  "playermale_22922": "You told me the librarian would be gone by now.",
  "playermale_22924": "[[Why do we need the key?]] Wait, why do we need a key? Isn't there a spell for this?",
  "playermale_22925": "[[Good idea.]] You distract; I get the key. Understood.",
  "playermale_22942": "[[Thanks to you.]] Only because of you. How are you feeling?",
  "playermale_22943": "[[What were you thinking?]] What on earth possessed you to do something like that?",
  "playermale_22963": "Thank you, Professor Hecat. Glad to have the opportunity to practise.",
  "playermale_22978": "[[I like the sound of that.]] Can't say no to that. What did you have in mind?",
  "playermale_22980": "[[Won't we get in trouble?]] Kogawa seems strict. I wouldn't want to get into trouble.",
  "playermale_22983": "[[If I help, will my feet become beets?]] How do you know it's safe? I don't want my feet to turn into beets as well.",
  "playermale_23030": "Sebastian?",
  "playermale_23055": "[[She made me nervous.]] Honestly, she was a bit intimidating.",
  "playermale_23056": "[[Sounds intriguing.]] You've intrigued me. Very well, lead the way.",
  "playermale_23059": "[[Should I be worried?]] I'm not sure. What's this all about?",
  "playermale_23068": "[[He clearly needs help.]] How awful. I can see why you're upset; he definitely needs some help.",
  "playermale_23069": "[[He deserved it.]] If I'm honest, I'd say he had it coming.",
  "playermale_23093": "[[Where to now?]] Sir, where are we going?",
  "playermale_23097": "[[Is this dangerous?]] Is the Headless Hunt dangerous?",

  "playermale_23381": "[[Sebastian, I think.]] I'd like to go with Sebastian.",
  "playermale_23382": "[[How about Natty?]] I'd like to go with Natty.",
  "playermale_23391": "[[I'll think about it.]] It does sound intriguing – but I need to consider my finances first. I'll come and find you if I'm interested.",
  "playermale_23402": "But what about curfew?",
  "playermale_23403": "Hello, Mr Moon. I have the moons you asked me to collect.",
  "playermale_23405": "[[I think I know all I need.]] I have nothing more to ask.",
  "playermale_23413": "[[I'm already exhausted.]] Wonderful. I can only imagine what we might find in there.",
  "playermale_23427": "[[I enjoyed it.]] Actually, I enjoyed it. I couldn't help but catch your enthusiasm.",
  "playermale_23443": "A sarcophagus. This must be Marmaduke.",
  "playermale_23444": "Should've known a Herbologist would use Devil's Snare.",
  "playermale_23446": "Well Marmaduke certainly left behind more than plants.",
  "playermale_23469": "[[Yes, I enjoyed the search.]] Yes, I rather enjoyed seeking him out.",
  "playermale_23471": "[[It was just an old skull.]] Why didn't you tell us it was just his skull?",
  "playermale_23504": "Poor Tobbs. Left here alone with the spiders.",
  "playermale_23506": "I am sorry to tell you this, Deek – but Tobbs is gone. It seems he was unable to avoid the spiders in the end.",
  "playermale_23508": "Did you say 'tickle the pear'?",
  "playermale_23524": "What seems to be the problem?",
  "playermale_23525": "Still in the market for an Invisibility Potion?",
  "playermale_23526": "[[I’m all out.]] I’m afraid I’m all out of Invisibility Potion. I suggest finding somewhere safe and being especially careful.",
  "playermale_23527": "[[I have some.]] Well, as it happens, I have what you need. Here. Not sure it'll help you though. Be careful, won't you?",
  "playermale_23528": "[[Your logic is flawed.]] The Grim, if you saw one, is an omen. Omens don't attack you. So I doubt an Invisibility Potion will do you much good.",
  "playermale_23529": "What is it? What’s wrong?",
  "playermale_23530": "Goblins got you yet? Or did you find some Maxima Potion?",
  "playermale_23531": "[[I don’t have any.]] I don’t have any of that. Perhaps you could try in Hogsmeade, or one of the hamlets?",
  "playermale_23532": "[[Here you go.]] You’re right; the world’s not safe at the moment. It’s best to take precautions. Here. Use it wisely.",
  "playermale_23533": "[[No charity.]] If you can’t defend yourself, you’d be better off staying out of their way. I’m not giving you charity.",
  "playermale_23534": "Everything all right?",
  "playermale_23535": "Not dead from that spider attack yet?",
  "playermale_23536": "[[I've run out.]] I was sure I had some, but it seems not. Afraid I'm not able to help. Good luck with the, er, spiders.",
  "playermale_23537": "[[I’ll help you.]] Spiders do tend to appear in ruins. Here, I have enough to spare. Stay away from the ruins though.",
  "playermale_23538": "[[You don't need it.]] You seem perfectly fine. Not a scratch. You don't need any Wiggenweld Potion.",
  "playermale_23544": "Officer Singer? I have some information you might be interested in.",
  "playermale_23545": "Cassandra Mason sold me her shop and then tried to drive me mad in a haunted dungeon.",
  "playermale_23604": "[[I'm game.]] If that's what I need to do to speak to Jackdaw, I'll do it.",
  "playermale_23607": "[[Why are you doing this to him?]] Why are you using Jackdaw's head for this game?",
  "playermale_23609": "[[How did you lose your head?]] How did you happen to become a member of the Headless Hunt?",
  "playermale_23616": "Hello, Penny. I had some questions about the shop.",
  "playermale_23617": "[[What can I sell?]] What kinds of things would I be able to sell in the shop?",
  "playermale_23618": "[[The shop looks a bit worse for wear.]] Why are the premises in such disarray?",
  "playermale_23629": "[[I'll go.]] It seems this may help us both. I shall do it.",
  "playermale_23641": "[[May I have them?]] I'd like to have those pages if you don't mind.",
  "playermale_23646": "[[How did you lose your head?]] I think I can guess how you died – but who did it to you?",
  "playermale_23649": "Samantha, is everything all right?",
  "playermale_23657": "I brewed an Edurus Potion as you asked, Professor.",
  "playermale_23658": "Not much for the cold, are you?",
  "playermale_23662": "That sounds a bit – mysterious.",
  "playermale_23664": "I'm getting used to things. What about you? Do you finally feel settled?",
  "playermale_23668": "I believe you.",
  "playermale_23669": "I'll keep that in mind, Natty. Thank you.",
  "playermale_23681": "[[Let's go.]] Actually – why not? I can beat your record.",
  "playermale_23682": "[[Not now.]] I actually don’t have time for this right now. Perhaps another day.",
  "playermale_23683": "Still up for that broom contest?",
  "playermale_23689": "[[Let's go.]] I'm ready to fly.",
  "playermale_23690": "[[Not now. I'll come back later.]] Now's not the best time. I'll see if I can come back later.",
  "playermale_23699": "[[I'm ready for the challenge.]] We'll soon see how I fare, won't we? I'm ready.",
  "playermale_23700": "[[I'll be back later.]] Not just yet. Perhaps later? I’ll come back when I’m feeling up to it.",
  "playermale_23702": "We’re still on for the trial, aren't we?",
  "playermale_23712": "Glad I could be of service.",
  "playermale_23713": "So how did you manage to get on the librarian's bad side?",
  "playermale_23717": "Oh, is your sister in Slytherin too?",
  "playermale_23718": "But you can see them?",
  "playermale_23720": "A little. It's positively enormous.",
  "playermale_23721": "Oh? Any you'd like to share with the class?",
  "playermale_23722": "Has she? That's nice to hear.",
  "playermale_23724": "Pardon me, Professor. What am I supposed to do with the dittany seeds?",
  "playermale_23742": "[[That's kind of you to say.]] I've been fortunate. Beginner's luck.",
  "playermale_23754": "[[Why that wand?]] Is there anything special about the wand?",
  "playermale_23755": "[[Why did he steal it?]] Why would the thief have taken the wand?",
  "playermale_23767": "[[What's in the cave?]] What will I find in the cave?",
  "playermale_23768": "[[Who cut off your head?]] Did someone in the cave cut off your head?",
  "playermale_23866": "Professor Binns, I found the statue of Sir Affpuddle.",
  "playermale_23880": "Well, my feet didn't turn into beets. That's a good start.",
  "playermale_23881": "That should reverse the curse. Hopefully.",
  "playermale_23883": "Professor!",
  "playermale_23887": "[[I'm ready to leave now.]] Shall we?",
  "playermale_23888": "[[I'd like to explore before we leave.]] I think I'd like to look around a bit first.",
  "playermale_23889": "From the outside, you'd never guess this place even existed in here.",
  "playermale_23890": "[[I'm finished.]] I believe I am.",
  "playermale_23891": "[[I'm not finished.]] Not quite yet. Just a few more minutes.",
  "playermale_23917": "Really? Well, thank you – I think.",
  "playermale_23919": "Poppy, where are you taking me?",
  "playermale_23942": "What's going on?",
  "playermale_23945": "Hello Professor. You wanted to speak with me?",
  "playermale_23946": "[[I enjoyed it.]] It was wonderful. I believe I'm really going to enjoy this class.",
  "playermale_23947": "[[Beasts make me nervous.]] It was all right, but honestly I find the beasts' unpredictability unnerving.",
  "playermale_23975": "[[Why did you take the wand?]] Why would you steal Mr Ollivander's family wand?",
  "playermale_23991": "[[How would the pages help her?]] How could a few pages of a book help her solve an old case?",
  "playermale_23992": "[[Can you tell me more about Helen?]] Can you tell me more about your great-niece?",
  "playermale_23993": "[[When were you Minister?]] When were you the Minister for Magic?",
  "playermale_24003": "[[Tell me more about Apollonia.]] Can you tell me more about Apollonia Black?",
  "playermale_24005": "[[Can you tell me more about the prisoner, Anne?]] I'd like to know more about Anne.",
  "playermale_24016": "I found the book that you said would exonerate you.",
  "playermale_24033": "[[I think I have what I need.]] Actually, I think I have enough information, thank you.",
  "playermale_24058": "Another shopkeeper? St Mungo's? I think you should explain, Penny.",
  "playermale_24087": "[[I'm terrified of spiders.]] You wouldn't know it by how many I've killed lately, but honestly I'm terrified of spiders.",
  "playermale_24088": "[[Spiders don't bother me at all.]] Spiders don't bother me at all. You'd be impressed by how many I've dispatched lately.",
  "playermale_24115": "Hello, Adelaide. How are you and your uncle doing?",
  "playermale_24119": "[[Thank you. How kind.]] That's very kind of you, Amit. Are you sure you won't need it?",
  "playermale_24121": "[[Sounds exciting, I'm in.]] No need to convince me. Let's get going.",
  "playermale_24122": "[[I suppose I could join you.]] All right, I suppose I can go with you. I hope it's worth it.",
  "playermale_24133": "[[And you'd like help finding it?]] And you need someone to help you find it.",
  "playermale_24134": "[[So, the telescope came with a catch?]] Ah, I had a feeling there would be a catch to that telescope.",
  "playermale_24135": "[[I look forward to that.]] Thank you Amit, I look forward to reading them.",
  "playermale_24136": "[[Ha! If you say so.]] Whatever you say, Amit. Whatever you say.",
  "playermale_24148": "[[Welcome back.]] There you are – welcome back.",
  "playermale_24149": "[[Let's not insult the angels.]] I wouldn't go so far as to say that.",
  "playermale_24155": "[[Thank you, Professor.]] I will be sure to speak with Deek if I need anything. Thank you.",
  "playermale_24158": "[[I'd like to know more about Deek.]] Can you tell me a bit more about Deek?",
  "playermale_24160": "Can you tell me where I might find Grimbald Weft?",
  "playermale_24161": "Where can I find that friendly knight you mentioned earlier?",
  "playermale_24195": "[[What happened to your ear?]] How did you injure your ear?",
  "playermale_24197": "Excuse me, Mr Sallow –",
  "playermale_24225": "Thank you, Miriam. For everything.",
  "playermale_24281": "I have the telescope. It's nicer than I had expected.",
  "playermale_24289": "Hello, Ominis. Do you have a moment?",
  "playermale_24303": "[[I notice you dismissed Divination. Why?]] Am I right in thinking you are unimpressed by Divination?",
  "playermale_24305": "[[What are Astronomy Tables?]] You mentioned Astronomy Tables earlier, in class. What were you talking about?",
  "playermale_24335": "Let's just learn what we can and get out.",
  "playermale_24337": "Let's take a look around, Amit. See if we can find any plans.",
  "playermale_24344": "I am indeed.",
  "playermale_24352": "Look at the size of this mine. Lodgok, where are you?",
  "playermale_24353": "This place is teeming with Ranrok's Loyalists. I have to keep my wits about me.",
  "playermale_24354": "What came over Lodgok? Coming here alone.",
  "playermale_24355": "This cart ought to get me deeper into the mine.",
  "playermale_24356": "How deep will this take me, I wonder?",
  "playermale_24358": "That has to be the end up ahead.",
  "playermale_24360": "Just like Gringotts, but I'm in the driver's seat this time.",
  "playermale_24364": "I'd better light these boilers if I want to go any further.",
  "playermale_24365": "<i>Incendio</i> should be enough to light these flames.",
  "playermale_24369": "I need to pull this platform closer.",
  "playermale_24370": "Better to get on one of those than try to jump across.",
  "playermale_24397": "Ugh!",
  "playermale_24398": "Oh! The smell!",
  "playermale_24399": "Merlin's beard, what's that smell?",
  "playermale_24406": "Nothing.",
  "playermale_24407": "No statues here.",
  "playermale_24408": "I'd best keep looking.",
  "playermale_24409": "I'll take that, thank you.",
  "playermale_24410": "Here's a welcome surprise.",
  "playermale_24411": "This will do nicely.",
  "playermale_24457": "[[That's hilarious.]] Beets for feet?  How hilarious! I mean, how terrible. Horrible, truly.",
  "playermale_24458": "[[That's awful.]] I'm so sorry. That sounds like a – trying situation.",
  "playermale_24464": "Professor Weasley – you wanted to see me?",
  "playermale_24480": "These devices run on steam power.",
  "playermale_24483": "[[I'll ask him.]] He does seem a bit cross with you. I'll speak with him.",
  "playermale_24490": "Astoria Crickett?",
  "playermale_24499": "Dreadful looking place, isn't it?",
  "playermale_24500": "It's sealed.",
  "playermale_24501": "Merlin's beard.",
  "playermale_24502": "Oho! This is far more powerful than <i>Stupefy</i>.",
  "playermale_24503": "I have a feeling I'm not alone here.",
  "playermale_24504": "Hmm. If I could power it somehow, it looks like it could be rotated.",
  "playermale_24505": "The witch's final resting place. Lodgok said the helmet was in her sarcophagus.",
  "playermale_24506": "A dead Ashwinder. Your compatriots must have made off with the helmet. Lodgok won't like this.",
  "playermale_24537": "Better show this to Lodgok.",
  "playermale_24615": "Yikes! Careful!",
  "playermale_24620": "Hello, Deek.",
  "playermale_24651": "This must be Tobbs's cave. I suppose I should head inside.",
  "playermale_24652": "Tobbs? Tobbs? Deek sent me. Are you in here?",
  "playermale_24653": "Tobbs's master is awful.",
  "playermale_24654": "It looks as if Tobbs was here some time ago. He must have headed deeper into the cave.",
  "playermale_24672": "That didn't sound particularly reassuring.",
  "playermale_24677": "What do you think?",
  "playermale_24680": "Right. So back to your frame – ?",
  "playermale_24726": "They're even more aggressive than I'd expected.",
  "playermale_24727": "Surely that's the last of them.",
  "playermale_24728": "Oh, no. This must be Mary. Poor woman.",
  "playermale_24729": "How can there be more? Aranshire won't be safe until they're all cleared out.",
  "playermale_24730": "I'd best be ready for whatever I may find down there.",
  "playermale_24732": "Can't let you harm Aranshire any more than you already have.",
  "playermale_24733": "This is definitely going to anger your parents.",
  "playermale_24734": "These eggs must be destroyed.",
  "playermale_24735": "Looks like that's all of them.",
  "playermale_24736": "I'll be having nightmares for the rest of my life after that.",
  "playermale_24737": "No wait, that's the last one – and she's angry!",
  "playermale_24738": "I'm back from the cave, Deek.",
  "playermale_24747": "[[Can I use Transfiguration magic anywhere?]] Can I use this type of Transfiguration magic outside of the Room?",
  "playermale_24751": "Of course. Traces of ancient magic.",
  "playermale_24752": "There must be more to this room.",
  "playermale_24753": "I love magic.",
  "playermale_24755": "I'm back in the Restricted Section. I should find out how Sebastian fared with Peeves.",
  "playermale_24756": "That's it!",
  "playermale_24789": "Why is your mistress selling the shop – and you?",
  "playermale_24790": "[[The shop looks a bit worse for wear.]] Why are the premises in such disarray?",
  "playermale_24791": "[[How did you become so good at selling?]] How are you so good at selling? Seems unusual for a house-elf?",
  "playermale_24792": "[[Not at all.]] I have a knack for this sort of thing, if I do say so myself. If I can meet your terms, I hope that you'll sell to me.",
  "playermale_24793": "[[My age is irrelevant if I have the money.]] I am quite capable of owning a shop, I can assure you. I should think you'd be happy to have a buyer.",
  "playermale_24794": "For what it's worth, she doesn't seem to have spotted us yet.",
  "playermale_24795": "Hmm. An 'exceedingly fair price' for a shop and an elf? What's the catch?",
  "playermale_24798": "From a distance.",
  "playermale_24799": "I don't suppose she'd listen to reason?",
  "playermale_24800": "I beg your pardon?",
  "playermale_24801": "There she is again.",
  "playermale_24802": "She isn't making it easy!",
  "playermale_24803": "Can't the curse be broken?",
  "playermale_24804": "Looks like everyone's gone. Better head to the common room.",
  "playermale_24810": "I suppose some introductions are in order.",
  "playermale_24821": "Thank you, Professor. But – what do you mean it will 'keep track' of what I'm learning?",
  "playermale_24823": "Hmm. A small favour in exchange for getting those pages?",
  "playermale_24824": "I beg your pardon – roast beef? Rotten roast beef?",
  "playermale_24827": "[[He was out of line.]] I'll admit I wasn't expecting him to be so angry.",
  "playermale_24832": "[[He's not that bad.]] Surely he can't be that terrible? Can he?",
  "playermale_24833": "[[I agree. He's awful.]] He truly is rather foul, isn't he?",
  "playermale_24834": "How lucky for us.",
  "playermale_24883": "What is it?",
  "playermale_24885": "Let's hurry.",
  "playermale_24908": "Yes, Professor.",
  "playermale_24928": "Pardon me, Mr Sallow.",
  "playermale_24944": "How is that?",
  "playermale_24945": "What is this place?",
  "playermale_24953": "Where are we, Deek?",
  "playermale_24959": "Not powerful enough. Perhaps <i>Depulso</i> will do.",
  "playermale_24974": "[[You did the right thing.]] You did what you had to do.",
  "playermale_24981": "I never thought I'd see the inside of Azkaban for myself.",
  "playermale_24988": "[[What precisely did you see in the stars?]] You said you 'divined a series of events' before our paths crossed. What were they?",
  "playermale_24989": "[[How do you know the symbol is where the Snidgets are?]] What makes you so sure the symbol is where the Snidgets are?",
  "playermale_24996": "I hope Adelaide's Uncle Rowland is all right. She seems very worried.",
  "playermale_24998": "Adelaide said that her uncle kept notes of his trades – maps. Perhaps these landmarks will lead me to him.",
  "playermale_24999": "This is the spot on the map. I'd best have my wits about me.",
  "playermale_25024": "Professor, I completed all of your most recent assignments.",
  "playermale_25028": "I finished the tasks, Professor.",
  "playermale_25030": "I've finished the activities you assigned me, Professor Garlick.",
  "playermale_25032": "Reporting back, Professor. Assignments all finished.",
  "playermale_25036": "[[I regret using <i>Crucio</i>.]] I know we had to do it to open the scriptorium, but it's not something I'd want to repeat.",
  "playermale_25037": "[[I agree, we did what we had to.]] It was hard to do, but casting <i>Crucio</i> was our only option.",
  "playermale_25043": "[[I believe I do.]] Yes. An unsuccessful shop would be bad for nearby businesses, I'd imagine.",
  "playermale_25044": "[[Why would you assume that I'll fail?]] Ha. Your faith in me is overwhelming. You're sorely mistaken if you think I'm going to fail.",
  "playermale_25059": "Greetings! I mean, out of my way, children.",
  "playermale_25060": "You call that a shine on those boots? Do better.",
  "playermale_25061": "Chewing with your mouth open? Where are your manners?",
  "playermale_25062": "Ahem! I wonder almost daily why I accepted this appointment from the Ministry.",
  "playermale_25063": "[[She did, indeed.]] Well, yes. She said she did. But I think you might have missed the bit about the dungeon.",
  "playermale_25064": "[[Why are you surprised?]] I am perfectly capable of owning a shop. But, more importantly, did you not hear the bit about the dungeon?",
  "playermale_25081": "Yes, what is it?",
  "playermale_25089": "I actually have some moons for you.",
  "playermale_25096": "Hello, Mr Moon.",
  "playermale_25109": "[[Why the toast?]] Why did I need the toast to get in here?",
  "playermale_25188": "I hope that house-elf can find us in here.",
  "playermale_25247": "It's my first time in Hogsmeade actually.",
  "playermale_25259": "No, that's not Grimbald Weft.",
  "playermale_25260": "Hmm, interesting. But not Grimbald Weft.",
  "playermale_25262": "[[Can you see anything from your other frame?]] I don't suppose you have any idea where your stolen frame was taken? Can you see anything from it?",
  "playermale_25286": "Oh, no. I have a feeling that house-elf is Tobbs.",
  "playermale_25295": "You do know he's screaming in the library as we speak.",
  "playermale_25354": "Remind me of the password to my office.",
  "playermale_25355": "[[You dare question me?]] How dare you question me? I've a mind to give you a matching set of ears.",
  "playermale_25356": "[[I've changed my mind.]] And now I'm telling you that you can tell me.",
  "playermale_25358": "Hmm. Right. Of course. I –",
  "playermale_25359": "[[It's to do with strength.]] Certainly I remember. It's still 'Stronger Together,' no?",
  "playermale_25360": "[[It's to do with my family's reign.]] Of course I remember. It's 'the Black Family Reigns.'",
  "playermale_25361": "[[It's to do with purity of blood.]] It's 'purebloods forever' – isn't it?",
  "playermale_25362": "Ha! Thank you. Never speak of this conversation with me or anyone else.",
  "playermale_25364": "Whatever you wish, Scrope. It's your – treasure.",
  "playermale_25401": "Thank you, Natty.",
  "playermale_25402": "Thank you.",
  "playermale_25403": "Thank you very much.",
  "playermale_25454": " How does anyone other than a house-elf manage to get around in here?",
  "playermale_25478": "All thanks to Professor Fig's quick thinking. Now what?",
  "playermale_25479": "[[Sebastian went too far.]] Sebastian acted rashly, but he acted out of instinct to save Anne.",
  "playermale_25481": "[[Sebastian saved his sister.]] Sebastian and I have encountered Ranrok's Loyalists before. That goblin would've killed Anne.",
  "playermale_25498": "Professor Weasley said I should ask you about changing the Room's ambiance.",
  "playermale_25499": "[[A cool, moonlit ambience sounds perfect.]] I would like the Room to feel as if it's being lit by the moon.",
  "playermale_25500": "[[I'd like something natural and earthy.]] I'd like the Room to feel natural and earthy, as though I'm outdoors.",
  "playermale_25501": "[[I'd like it to feel warm and cosy.]] I'd like the Room to be warm and comfortable – as if I'm floating inside a mug of Butterbeer.",
  "playermale_25502": "[[I focus best in a room that is dark and mysterious.]] I'd like the Room to feel mysterious and eerie, as if I'm in the Forbidden Forest, surrounded by shadows.",
  "playermale_25506": "You don't think the rumours about the cave are true, do you?",
  "playermale_25507": "Shall we take a closer look?",
  "playermale_25509": "I beg your pardon?",
  "playermale_25510": "'Scrope'? Who is Scrope?",
  "playermale_25511": "Pumpkins? Ah. I think I know just the place.",
  "playermale_25513": "[[Hand them over.]] I must insist that you give them to me at once.",

  "playermale_25518": "No, it's not. It's the Hog's Head.",
  "playermale_25545": "Hello, Deek. You'll be pleased to know that a little Thestral was born.",
  "playermale_25549": "Hello Deek. You wanted to talk to me?",
  "playermale_25552": "[[I could burn you.]] I could just burn you and be done with it.",
  "playermale_25561": "I've completed all of my tasks, Professor Onai.",
  "playermale_25610": "Deek, could you remind me where I need to go to find the phoenix?",
  "playermale_25626": "Let's get you back to the Room. Deek's going to be pleased.",
  "playermale_25627": "Yes, Deek. And I rescued it from the poachers. I have it here. It's safe.",
  "playermale_25636": "[[What might I encounter in the tomb?]] Don't suppose you have any idea what could be waiting for me inside the tomb?",
  "playermale_25671": "Yes sir.",
  "playermale_25681": "'Toujours pur.'",
  "playermale_25688": "Ugh. I suppose I can do that. But why me?",
  "playermale_25689": "Lodgok. The sarcophagus had been raided. I found no helmet – only a dead Ashwinder.",
  "playermale_25708": "I'll say.",
  "playermale_25709": "We'll see about that.",
  "playermale_25726": "Gah! These Inferi are horrible.",
  "playermale_25727": "They're certainly persistent.",
  "playermale_25728": "Stay back!",
  "playermale_25729": "Perhaps <i>Accio</i> would help.",
  "playermale_25730": "Need to get that platform closer – but how?",
  "playermale_25731": "If only I could pull it to within reach.",
  "playermale_25734": "It's sealed shut from the other side.",
  "playermale_25735": "Oh!",
  "playermale_25738": "This is pointless. I need to go.",
  "playermale_25739": "I must unseal that door mechanism to escape.",
  "playermale_25762": "Intra muros.",
  "playermale_25768": "Hello. I'm here to help. I can take you somewhere safe.",
  "playermale_25818": "I know.",
  "playermale_25820": "Rather good at this, aren't you?",
  "playermale_25821": "You're not going to make this easy, are you?",
  "playermale_25832": "Nothing lucky about it.",
  "playermale_25834": "Scrope!",
  "playermale_25839": "I haven't time for any of you at the moment. None. None at all. Move aside.",
  "playermale_25840": "If you must speak with me, consult my secretaries, or, uh, what have you. Now, move along.",
  "playermale_25848": "Oh, I – uh – places to be, Professor Sharp. Places to be.",
  "playermale_25853": "Has anyone seen my ivory-handled hand mirror? Of course you haven't.",
  "playermale_25854": "When I witness what passes for magic in these halls, I – er – I simply mourn for the future of the wizarding world.",
  "playermale_25855": "Stand proud, purebloods. The future is yours.",
  "playermale_25856": "I did? I did. Yes. Well, spit it out, Sharp. I don't have all day.",
  "playermale_25886": "The phoenix!",
  "playermale_25920": "[[It may have been the wrong choice.]] There was little time to react, but it was an Unforgivable Curse.",
  "playermale_25925": "I have been thinking about something Professor Howin said in Beasts class – that I should study as many beasts as I can on my own time.",
  "playermale_25926": "But what is 'it'?",
  "playermale_25927": "Excuse me, Professor, could you remind me what my assignments were about?",
  "playermale_25972": "So far, so good.",
  "playermale_25973": "Troll!",
  "playermale_25974": "Nothing like an angry troll to bring friends together.",
  "playermale_26033": "[[Well, then. Let's go.]] I'll help you find the letter, Natty.",
  "playermale_26035": "[[Can't we just go straight to the Ministry?]] Can't we just bypass Officer Singer and go directly to the Ministry?",
  "playermale_26036": "Natty, what's going on? Why are we all the way out here?",
  "playermale_26053": "Were you able to find the letter?",
  "playermale_26054": "It was exhilarating, wasn't it? I wasn't sure we were going to make it out alive.",
  "playermale_26066": "Thank you, Madam Thistlewood. I shall do my best.",
  "playermale_26069": "No one's been here for ages.",
  "playermale_26072": "No, that's not it.",
  "playermale_26073": "No. Hmmm. How did you do this, Jackdaw?",
  "playermale_26074": "It's no wonder Anne never found that clue.",
  "playermale_26075": "Ha! You'll not outfox me, Jackdaw.",
  "playermale_26076": "Oh! That's done something.",
  "playermale_26077": "Ah. I see how this goes.",
  "playermale_26078": "You couldn't outwit me, Jackdaw. Now, where's the clue you left behind?",
  "playermale_26079": "No, this isn't the one.",
  "playermale_26080": "This isn't quite right. I'd best keep searching.",
  "playermale_26081": "This must be the place Minister Diggory mentioned. Helen lives around here somewhere.",
  "playermale_26092": "Professor Sharp, could I ask you about my extra assignments?",
  "playermale_26093": "Professor, could you remind me of the purpose of the assignments you set for me?",
  "playermale_26094": "[[What is the purpose of my tasks?]] Please, could you remind me the purpose of my tasks, Professor?",
  "playermale_26095": "Could you remind me of the reason for these extra assignments, Professor?",
  "playermale_26102": "I like to think I can be trusted,  but I suppose we'll find out.",
  "playermale_26151": "What would you like me to do next, Professor?",
  "playermale_26178": "I do hope Sebastian's all right.",
  "playermale_26181": "[[Why have others failed?]] It looks to be rather a mess. Why haven't other tenants been able to make a go of it there?",
  "playermale_26199": "You mean I'll actually be able to turn invisible?",
  "playermale_26229": "I'm looking forward to it.",
  "playermale_26230": "You were a Gryffindor?",
  "playermale_26233": "This is the entrance?",
  "playermale_26235": "I can be quite resourceful.",
  "playermale_26270": "[[It is stunning.]] It looks stunning, Lodgok. I see why you wanted it back.",
  "playermale_26271": "[[It looks like a helmet.]] It just looks like a helmet to me.",
  "playermale_26272": "[[Sounds unnecessarily dangerous.]] Surely another spell could be used to mince daisy roots. Why learn this one?",
  "playermale_26274": "You have a new spell to teach me, Professor?",
  "playermale_26275": "[[All went perfectly well, Professor.]] Yes, sir. Of course.",
  "playermale_26298": "[[She tried to kill us.]] That's rather generous, isn't it? She did try to kill us the entire time.",
  "playermale_26332": "Now to see what lies beyond.",
  "playermale_26333": "And now back to 'the face of stone and tendrils.'",
  "playermale_26369": "I wish I had better news about your uncle and Anne.",
  "playermale_26389": "Well, I – thank you Amit.",
  "playermale_26395": "Are you all right? Are you – holding your breath?",
  "playermale_26396": "She did, indeed.",
  "playermale_26401": "Madam Kogawa – about what happened in class –",
  "playermale_26435": "[[Of course. Pleasure doing business with you.]] Wonderful. Shall I head directly to the shop?",
  "playermale_26436": "[[I'm not sure about this.]] Wait a minute – 'brave'? Perhaps this isn't a good idea.",
  "playermale_26437": "[[Oh, all right, then.]] Ah, of course. And you're right. Shall I head directly to the shop, then?",
  "playermale_26438": "[[Actually, I think I'll pass.]] Now that I've considered it further, I'd rather not purchase the shop at this time.",
  "playermale_26520": "What should I be doing right now?",
  "playermale_26551": "[[I'll see what I can find.]] I'll have a look for you. You've certainly given me plenty to go on.",
  "playermale_26555": "[[I'll see what I can do.]] I'll try my very best, Mr Dunne.",
  "playermale_26571": "A ghost or a poltergeist? Hmm – A non-being can never have been.",
  "playermale_26590": "Grata Domum.",
  "playermale_26595": "[[I see power.]] I see good things. After all, the future's mine for the taking – and I shall take what I must.",
  "playermale_26601": "[[Why are you so terrified of spiders?]] Why is it you can't conquer your fear of spiders?",
  "playermale_26607": "Hello, how are you?",
  "playermale_26611": "[[Your uncle didn't want you at Hogwarts?]] Why did your uncle want to keep you from Hogwarts this year?",
  "playermale_26612": "[[Your uncle sounds awful.]] Your uncle sounds like a bit of a twit.",
  "playermale_26614": "[[I'm not sure.]] I honestly don't know, Professor.",
  "playermale_26615": "Brilliant!",
  "playermale_26637": "This was his old telescope? Looks practically brand new.",
  "playermale_26662": "A blockade. Rookwood's poachers are already here.",
  "playermale_26666": "More poachers? How many are there?",
  "playermale_26670": "If Mary was breeding these things in her cellar – that means there are more underground.",
  "playermale_26671": "I'll need to destroy every last spider in that cellar if this is to end.",
  "playermale_26672": "This cellar gate looks to be locked. I'll need a key to enter.",
  "playermale_26673": "If this was where Mary bred the spiders, they're not here now.",
  "playermale_26674": "I hate to think that they see me – but I don't see them.",
  "playermale_26676": "Egg sacs! I need to find and destroy all of these before the situation gets even worse.",
  "playermale_26713": "Mr Gaunt. Where do you think you're going?",
  "playermale_26714": "Taking the day off, eh? Typical student, wasting the hours away.",
  "playermale_26715": "Garreth, er, Mr Weasley, what are you doing here? Don't you have – er –somewhere to be?",
  "playermale_26716": "I'm looking for my house-elf. Surely you've seen him.",
  "playermale_26723": "[[It was. Never used my wand in combat.]] In fact, it was. Perhaps I have a knack for it.",
  "playermale_26724": "[[I've had my share of wand combat.]] I've duelled enough. Consider yourself lucky I held back.",
  "playermale_26725": "Where am I? Professor Fitzgerald? Can you hear me?",
  "playermale_26729": "Highwing!",
  "playermale_26732": "Understandable. But why don't you check on her yourself?",
  "playermale_26733": "I am sorry about your friend. But you'll be relieved to know that I cleared out the spiders. It's safe to return now.",
  "playermale_26736": "Well this isn't a good sign. These spiders have gone somewhere.",
  "playermale_26742": "[[Indeed you don't!]] That's the spirit. I wish you the best of luck.",
  "playermale_26743": "[[It's not a pretty sight.]] Even so, you'll want to prepare yourself. The place needs something of a – clean up.",
  "playermale_26751": "Highwing!",
  "playermale_26752": "Blast it.  There's got to be another way to get up to the roof – somewhere.",
  "playermale_26754": "[[I see triumph.]] There will be hardship, I'm sure of it. But I see triumph in the end.",
  "playermale_26755": "[[I sense danger.]] I can't get rid of this feeling of a coming – danger.",
  "playermale_26756": "[[I visited the Owlery.]] Greetings, Mr Ollivander. I visited the Owlery as you suggested.",
  "playermale_26757": "It was. But – I don't think either of us could have predicted where I'd end up.",
  "playermale_26758": "I met the ghost of Richard Jackdaw himself. He pointed me to the cave where he died, wand in hand.",
  "playermale_26763": "Password?",
  "playermale_26764": "Hello, Natty. How are you?",
  "playermale_26765": "[[Herbology is a fascinating class.]] I never thought magical plants could be so thrilling.",
  "playermale_26766": "[[I prefer Charms class, actually.]] I will say that Herbology wasn't as much fun as Charms.",
  "playermale_26780": "Thank you, Officer Singer.",
  "playermale_26781": "Thank you, Poppy. I'll be gentle.",
  "playermale_26782": "I don't know, but they don't look particularly appetising to me.",
  "playermale_26794": "Natty, I have some questions.",
  "playermale_26795": "[[What do I need to do again?]] Natty, what do I need to do again?",
  "playermale_26796": "[[What are your reasons for going after Rookwood and Harlow?]] You seem to be very determined in stopping Rookwood and Harlow. Why?",
  "playermale_26803": "[[All right.]] Challenge accepted then.",
  "playermale_26804": "[[I don’t want your respect.]] I don’t want respect from the likes of you. All you do is insult people.",
  "playermale_26805": "[[Absolutely. Let's go.]] Ready when you are.",
  "playermale_26806": "[[Changed your mind about me?]] Does this mean you've changed your mind about me?",
  "playermale_26807": "[[Scared everyone else away?]] So – what? You finally scared everyone else away?",
  "playermale_26812": "I did indeed find your family wand, but it was in pieces – beyond repair.",
  "playermale_26820": "He didn't want you to identify him.",
  "playermale_26838": "Now, to find out what happened here.",
  "playermale_26839": "A rock formation? That's the first landmark on this map. Now to find the crooked tree.",
  "playermale_26840": "A crooked tree, just as the map said. The crumbling tower shouldn't be far from here.",
  "playermale_26841": "And the crumbling tower. The spot on the map should be directly south of here.",
  "playermale_26842": "Ah. Yes. Mixed with, um, Bubotuber pus makes a fine, er, moustache paste, yes, moustache paste, I find.",
  "playermale_26844": "I assure you I am quite healthy, Gaunt. If I need a medical diagnosis, I shall head to St Mungo's.",
  "playermale_26845": "I hear you're getting quite good at those concoctions you brew.",
  "playermale_26846": "I am watching you, Mr Weasley. Mr Redding, who owns Honeydukes, tells me some of his Billywig stings recently went missing.",
  "playermale_26847": "On your way, Mr Weasley.",
  "playermale_26865": "What nonsense! Uh – that you would trivialise the health of a student over a silly game.",
  "playermale_26866": "[[Please do.]] Good idea. I can even provide the parchment should you need it. Now where is my elf?",
  "playermale_26879": "Please, go on.",
  "playermale_26900": "[[I'll go again.]] I'm ready to give it another go.",
  "playermale_26901": "Hello again, Imelda. This course is a bit far from the castle, isn't it?",
  "playermale_26932": "Those marks. They look like the ones over the door.",
  "playermale_26933": "I know just the spell to pull that free.",
  "playermale_26973": "Ah. Then I am glad to be rid of it myself.",
  "playermale_27051": "You are a fierce one.",
  "playermale_27052": "I don't think I can take much more of this.",
  "playermale_27053": "Well, that doesn't work!",
  "playermale_27061": "That ought to give Professor Fig some breathing room.",
  "playermale_27062": "I received your owl. What happened with Ominis?",
  "playermale_27079": "[[That's incredible.]] Now the nickname makes sense. What an extraordinary ability to have.",
  "playermale_27080": "[[How did you become an Animagus?]] Were you born an Animagus or did you learn to become one?",
  "playermale_27083": "[[Do you choose your Animagus form?]] Can you choose what form your Animagus will take?",
  "playermale_27084": "[[What does it feel like?]] How does it feel to transform into an animal?",
  "playermale_27101": "And you declined?",
  "playermale_27126": "Ready?",
  "playermale_27127": "<i>Crucio!</i>",
  "playermale_27128": "I'm ready.",
  "playermale_27129": "Aaarrrghhhh!",

  "playermale_27160": "Hello, Imelda. Albie Weekes sent me –",
  "playermale_27161": "Perhaps I am competition.",
  "playermale_27162": "[[You sound jealous.]] Seems someone's jealous of my skills on a broom.",
  "playermale_27166": "[[That's not what happened.]] I don't know what people have said, but I certainly wasn't 'showing off'.",
  "playermale_27202": "Perhaps I should use <i>Protego</i>.",
  "playermale_27219": "[[Why was Marmaduke famous?]] Why is your ancestor so well known?",
  "playermale_27220": "A troll? You can't be serious.",
  "playermale_27228": "I should think you'd be a bit weaker by now.",
  "playermale_27229": "There is another matter, Scrope. I confiscated this filthy diary from a student. It smells of squid and seawater.",
  "playermale_27232": "Now, off with you.",
  "playermale_27248": "Are all of the Trials like this one?",
  "playermale_27291": "I wondered if you might teach me how to cast a curse that you mentioned.",

  "playermale_27294": "[[The Killing Curse.]] I'd like to learn how to cast the Killing Curse.",
  "playermale_27295": "[[Never mind.]] On second thought, perhaps I don't need to learn any curses at the moment.",
  "playermale_27296": "[[I've learned all I wanted to.]] That's all I wanted to learn for now. Thank you.",
  "playermale_27338": "[[What was it like growing up with poachers?]] What was it like growing up in a family of poachers?",
  "playermale_27340": "I need your help, friend.",

  "playermale_27362": "Professor Hecat, I'm here about the new defensive spell you mentioned.",

  "playermale_27384": "[[I won't hold back either.]] I don't plan on holding back either.",
  "playermale_27440": "What in the – who's there?",
  "playermale_27462": "[[It's wise to move on.]] It's time to move on, Deek. There's nothing to be done now.",

  "playermale_27489": "[[You're succeeding.]] From everything I've seen, you're doing precisely that.",
  "playermale_27490": "[[You can't save all of them.]] Poppy, you're only one person. You can't save them all.",
  "playermale_27500": "[[Sounds versatile.]] Sounds versatile, albeit a little dangerous. I suppose that's why it's so useful.",
  "playermale_27504": "Thank you, Professor.",
  "playermale_27664": "There's Ollivanders. I hope he can help me craft the Keepers' wand.",
  "playermale_27700": "I know there's a mechanism to open this door.",
  "playermale_27701": "There must be some sort of mechanism for this doorway.",
  "playermale_27702": "They're never-ending! I need to get out of here!",
  "playermale_27824": "This is brilliant.",
  "playermale_27825": "This'll take some getting used to.",
  "playermale_27826": "Ah – I think I'm getting the hang of this.",
  "playermale_27827": "Wish I had my own broom.",
  "playermale_27829": "It looks as though Adelaide's instincts were spot on.",

  "playermale_28018": "Well, I'd say it was a pleasure, but –",

  "playermale_28143": "Hello, sir. Might you have some time to talk?",
  "playermale_28144": "[[Tell me about your shop.]] What can you tell me about your shop?",
  "playermale_28146": "[[Tell me about yourself.]] I'd like to learn a bit about you, sir, if you don't mind.",
  "playermale_28147": "[[I'd like to know more about your hamlet.]] I'd like to ask you a bit about Marunweem, if you don't mind.",
  "playermale_28150": "[[Any of Rookwood's lot about?]] Have you heard rumours about Dark witches or wizards lurking nearby?",
  "playermale_28151": "[[Anything of interest nearby?]] Any notable places I should look at while I'm here?",
  "playermale_28182": "[[Professor Sharp seemed to disagree.]] Professor Sharp didn't seem as impressed as you are.",
  "playermale_28183": "[[I was relieved.]] I'm glad I was able to get it right the first time.",
  "playermale_28199": "[[Thank you for your time.]] Thank you. I don't need any more of your time.",
  "playermale_28201": "Mr Adley, do you have a moment?",
  "playermale_28202": "[[Tell me about yourself.]] I'd like to know more about you, Mr Adley.",
  "playermale_28218": "Pardon me, Madam. Do you have a moment?",
  "playermale_28219": "[[Any gossip going around?]] Have you heard any rumours about goings-on in Bainburgh?",
  "playermale_28220": "[[Would you mind telling me a bit about yourself?]] Are you the shopkeeper here?",
  "playermale_28221": "[[What do you sell?]] What do you have for sale?",
  "playermale_28222": "[[It was nice speaking with you.]] Thank you for taking the time to speak with me.",
  "playermale_28225": "[[Any rumours going about?]] Any 'whispers' going about the town?",

  "playermale_28227": "[[What do you sell?]] What do you have for sale?",
  "playermale_28242": "[[You were being creative.]] You don't create anything worthwhile without setting a few things on fire.",
  "playermale_28243": "[[A fire, Garreth?]] If you're setting things on fire, then perhaps you ought to rethink your choices.",
  "playermale_28244": "Ominis cares. So much so that he told me to use <i>Imperio</i> on him.",
  "playermale_28247": "The note and rendition of the relic – it matches. This must be where the student left the relic.",
  "playermale_28320": "Hello, Mr Sehmi.",

  "playermale_28364": "Nice.",
  "playermale_28373": "He doesn't want to fight you and he can't stand by and let you leave with the relic. I said I'd take responsibility. I need you to teach me the Curse.",
  "playermale_28378": "Ominis has agreed that it's the only way, Sebastian. Will the Curse hurt him?",
  "playermale_28380": "How much did you hear?",
  "playermale_28381": "Sebastian's done his research. He knows what he's doing.",
  "playermale_28383": "And if nothing will change his mind?",
  "playermale_28435": "Let's keep going.",
  "playermale_28458": "Hello, nice to meet you.",
  "playermale_28460": "Nice to see you again.",
  "playermale_28464": "[[What can you tell me about this hamlet?]] I'm curious to know what's happening in Feldcroft. Might you have any insight?",
  "playermale_28465": "[[What sorts of items do you sell?]] What do you sell here?",
  "playermale_28466": "[[Can you tell me a bit about yourself?]] What brought you to own a shop in Feldcroft?",
  "playermale_28516": "Excuse me, madam – ?",
  "playermale_28517": "Madam Navarro? How are you?",
  "playermale_28518": "[[Where do you get your stocks?]] How do you collect the items you sell?",
  "playermale_28519": "[[How long have you lived in Cragcroft?]] Have you lived in Cragcroft all of your life?",

  "playermale_28538": "The Inferi – they're everywhere.",
  "playermale_28539": "These Inferi seem far from controlled.",
  "playermale_28540": "How many Inferi are there?",
  "playermale_28541": "Why wouldn't you stop? I was calling after you.",
  "playermale_28543": "<i>Confringo!</i>",
  "playermale_28544": "You are going to help me.",
  "playermale_28564": "They're gone. For now. I need to get out of here. Where could Niamh be?",
  "playermale_28565": "Closed tight. No way but forward, I suppose.",
  "playermale_28567": "Now's my chance.",
  "playermale_28569": "I need to time this just right.",
  "playermale_28570": "I need to turn back. There's no getting past them that way.",
  "playermale_28574": "This is the way forward. Finally free. Now where are you, Niamh?",
  "playermale_28575": "What is it?",
  "playermale_28577": "Thank you, Garreth. So am I.  Are you related to Professor Weasley?",
  "playermale_28579": "[[That must be nice.]] Must be nice having an aunt for a professor.",
  "playermale_28580": "[[Then you can do whatever you want.]] You must be able to get away with anything.",
  "playermale_28587": "Hello, Lenora. What are you looking at?",
  "playermale_28595": "[[Have you learned anything about it?]] Have you gained any insights about the painting since you've been studying it?",
  "playermale_28608": "[[I followed the clues.]] I found the location depicted in the painting and then I cast <i>Lumos</i> to guide a moth back to the frame.",
  "playermale_28609": "[[I'm not telling.]] I'm afraid I can't tell you Lenora.",
  "playermale_28613": "Were you calling me, Garreth?",
  "playermale_28626": "A one-eyed witch statue shouldn't be too hard to find.",
  "playermale_28627": "It worked.",
  "playermale_28628": "Goodness! Who knew this was all down here?",
  "playermale_28629": "This looks like the right statue. Now, what was the password?",
  "playermale_28630": "I'm going to have to get past this.",
  "playermale_28632": "What in Merlin's name is this?",
  "playermale_28633": "It looks a bit broken. Perhaps I can try –",
  "playermale_28634": "I think I could break through this.",
  "playermale_28635": "This must be the way out.",
  "playermale_28636": "Honeydukes. I can smell the chocolate.",
  "playermale_28647": "Now, where would I find the dried Billywig stings for Garreth?",
  "playermale_28650": "[[You heard correctly.]] He did say that. He wants me to get more ingredients to brew another potion.",
  "playermale_28652": "I suspect that is where I come in.",
  "playermale_28655": "Here's the Fwooper feather you wanted.",
  "playermale_28656": "That was an interesting class.",
  "playermale_28685": "[[Professor Ronen mentioned that.]] Professor Ronen did mention something about that.",
  "playermale_28687": "You have a new spell to teach me, Professor?",
  "playermale_28688": "I completed the assignments, Professor.",
  "playermale_28689": "Professor, why must I complete these tasks?",
  "playermale_28708": "For now.",
  "playermale_28709": "Not a chance.",
  "playermale_28712": "I suppose I'm not allowed up there.",
  "playermale_28713": "Hmm. Seems that's off-limits to me.",
  "playermale_28714": "I can't go up there.",
  "playermale_28715": "It appears I won't be going up there.",
  "playermale_28727": "[[It was terrifying.]] It's true, and I was almost killed. Professor Fig and I were lucky to escape with our lives.",
  "playermale_28728": "[[It's true.]] Yes. Our carriage was attacked by a dragon.",
  "playermale_28737": "I'm here about the new spell you wanted to teach me, Professor.",
  "playermale_28740": "Professor, could you remind me what I'm to do before I can learn <i>Incendio</i>?",
  "playermale_28741": "I finished all of the tasks you gave me, Professor Hecat.",
  "playermale_28744": "[[That must be awkward.]] Does having your aunt here make things difficult?",
  "playermale_28748": "Hello, Duncan. I have the proof you wanted.",
  "playermale_28749": "[[Actually, I might just keep this.]] Now that I think about it, 'Puffskein Dunkein,' I think I shall keep this. You need to overcome your cowardice.",
  "playermale_28750": "[[Happy to help. Take it.]] Of course. I hope this helps you prove yourself.",
  "playermale_28751": "You wanted to speak with me?",
  "playermale_28752": "Can you remind me of our arrangement?",
  "playermale_28757": "[[I'll see what I can do.]] Very well. If I'm in the area, perhaps I shall take a look.",
  "playermale_28765": "What are you doing out here?",
  "playermale_28766": "[[Very well.]] I'm in. Let's do it.",
  "playermale_28767": "[[Not right now.]] Perhaps another time.",
  "playermale_28768": "[[I'm game.]] I'm game for another round.",
  "playermale_28769": "[[Not now.]] Another time, perhaps.",
  "playermale_28773": "Hello, Samantha. Are you here for Summoner's Court?",
  "playermale_28774": "[[I'm ready.]] Yes, I'm ready to play.",
  "playermale_28775": "[[Not now.]] Perhaps another time.",
  "playermale_28776": "[[You underestimated me.]] More like you underestimated me. That was your mistake.",
  "playermale_28777": "[[You played well.]] Don't say that, Samantha. You're a fine player.",
  "playermale_28778": "[[Yes.]] But of course.",
  "playermale_28779": "[[Not now.]] Perhaps another time.",
  "playermale_28780": "Hello, are you my next Summoner's Court opponent?",
  "playermale_28781": "Pleased to meet you, Grace.",
  "playermale_28782": "[[Yes.]] I'm game.",
  "playermale_28783": "[[Not now.]] Perhaps I'll play later.",
  "playermale_28784": "[[Good game.]] You played a good game, though, Grace.",
  "playermale_28785": "[[It was easy.]] There wasn't much to it.",
  "playermale_28786": "[[Yes.]] Let's have at.",
  "playermale_28787": "[[Not now.]] Perhaps another time.",
  "playermale_28788": "Hello. Are you here for Summoner's Court?",
  "playermale_28789": "[[Yes.]] Of course, Charlotte.",
  "playermale_28790": "[[Not now.]] Not at the moment, I'm afraid.",
  "playermale_28791": "[[I play by intuition.]] I play by intuition. Natural skill and all that.",
  "playermale_28792": "[[Practice.]] I practise as much as I can.",
  "playermale_28793": "[[I do, in fact.]] Absolutely. Don't count me out yet.",
  "playermale_28794": "[[Not now.]] Perhaps another time.",
  "playermale_28795": "Natty – I hope I haven't kept you waiting long.",
  "playermale_28796": "I've been looking forward to it.",
  "playermale_28797": "Hello, Sebastian.",
  "playermale_28799": "Really?",
  "playermale_28800": "I'm not going anywhere with you!",
  "playermale_28801": "Tell Rookwood to find me himself!",
  "playermale_28804": "This can't be the witch's tomb. Likely I need to go further.",
  "playermale_28805": "You're my Summoner's Court opponent, Professor Ronen?",
  "playermale_28806": "[[Very well.]] I'm ready.",
  "playermale_28807": "[[Not now.]] Perhaps another time, Professor.",
  "playermale_28808": "[[I'm a natural.]] I suppose there's not much left you can teach me now.",
  "playermale_28809": "[[Yes.]] I would. I'd like a chance to improve my record.",
  "playermale_28810": "[[Not now.]] Not at the moment.",
  "playermale_28812": "What is the reason for these additional assignments, Professor?",
  "playermale_28813": "[[I've completed my assignments.]] I've completed my assignments, Professor.",
  "playermale_28816": "I completed your assignments, Professor.",
  "playermale_28837": "Could you remind me about the reason for the assignments you gave me, Professor?",
  "playermale_28838": "I completed your assignment, Professor. I'm ready to learn <i>Bombarda</i> now.",
  "playermale_28840": "What was the purpose of these assignments again, Professor?",
  "playermale_28841": "Madam Kogawa, I completed the list of tasks you assigned.",
  "playermale_28842": "It is. I haven't left the castle since I arrived.",
  "playermale_28844": "As am I. Thank you, by the way.",
  "playermale_28847": "[[How extraordinary.]] Merlin – of the legend of King Arthur?",
  "playermale_28849": "This trunk?",
  "playermale_28851": "What should I do now?",
  "playermale_28860": "[[I can't wait, Professor.]] I've been dreaming of this day for a long time. Can't believe I'm here.",
  "playermale_28870": "Dissendium.",
  "playermale_28871": "First, let me thank you for what you did in the library.",
  "playermale_28872": "It's well disguised.",
  "playermale_28875": "I think I've got it.",
  "playermale_28884": "Oh, hello. Ominis, isn't it? I believe we have Potions together. And – Herbology?",
  "playermale_28886": "[[Sebastian showed me.]] Actually, Sebastian brought me there. But he made it perfectly clear to keep quiet about it.",
  "playermale_28890": "You wanted to speak with me, Professor?",
  "playermale_28893": "Let's get you back to your frame, little moth.",
  "playermale_28894": "The moth stopped. Perhaps I need to keep casting <i>Lumos</i> on it.",
  "playermale_28895": "Ashwinders –",
  "playermale_28897": "Lenora, I solved the mystery of that painting.",
  "playermale_28898": "Ha! I knew there was a connection.",
  "playermale_28899": "I should tell Lenora that I solved the puzzle of that empty frame.",
  "playermale_28901": "Hmph. A moth. That frame was decorated with moths. I wonder if this one belongs there.",
  "playermale_28904": "Thank you. Nice to meet you – was that your cat?",
  "playermale_28905": "[[Shame. I think magical beasts are incredible.]] I'm sorry to hear that. I think magical beasts are rather incredible.",
  "playermale_28906": "[[I tend to agree with your mother.]] Your mother's right. Magical beasts are more trouble than they're worth.",
  "playermale_28910": "[[I'm sorry about that.]] I'm sorry, Professor. I was merely trying to help a friend.",
  "playermale_28912": "[[Why do you want to know?]] Yes, but why does that matter to you?",
  "playermale_28913": "[[I can get you that feather.]] I'll get you the Fwooper feather, as long as you're certain Sharp won't miss it.",
  "playermale_28919": "Strange to think one could be led by butterflies.",
  "playermale_28920": "I know the Forest is forbidden, but surely it can't be that dangerous.",
  "playermale_28921": "Ha – there they are. She wasn't making it up.",
  "playermale_28922": "Well, we've come this far. Miss Willardsey might get an answer about these butterflies.",
  "playermale_28923": "Well, well. Look what we have here –",
  "playermale_28924": "Pardon me, but were you saying something?",
  "playermale_28934": "Hello Miss Willardsey.",
  "playermale_28935": "[[Yes. And I was well rewarded.]] They led me into the Forest and revealed a treasure.",
  "playermale_28936": "[[Yes. Nothing exciting I'm afraid.]] I did. And I followed them into the Forest, but I'm afraid there was nothing to see.",
  "playermale_28941": "Ah yes. We met in the common room.",
  "playermale_28946": "[[I thought Merlin was a myth.]] I thought that Merlin and the tales about King Arthur's court were mere myth.",
  "playermale_29170": "Is everything all right?",
  "playermale_29175": "Can you remind me what you needed help with again?",
  "playermale_29177": "Now, which way is the common room?",
  "playermale_29187": "[[How fascinating.]] I can see why you're so interested in Merlin. I'd be keen to know more about the Trials.",
  "playermale_29188": "[[Seems a bit tedious.]] I'm not sure old vine-covered pillars are worth studying.",
  "playermale_29192": "I have the mallowsweet.",
  "playermale_29193": "The flames make the pyre sink.",
  "playermale_29199": "Hello, Arthur. What was it we were going to do?",
  "playermale_29204": "Hello, Arthur. Thought you might like to know that my map led to a doorway hidden within a portrait.",
  "playermale_29214": "Pardon me, is everything all right?",
  "playermale_29215": "I'm afraid I don't follow – who spoiled things? Also, what bells?",
  "playermale_29216": "[[I might be able to help with the bells.]] Perhaps I could help put the bells back up.",
  "playermale_29217": "[[What's so important about the bells?]] Is it really that important that the bells go back up?",
  "playermale_29218": "[[Did Professor Black really remove the bells for a headache?]] It's certainly an odd decree, even for Black – taking down the bells for a headache.",
  "playermale_29219": "[[Why can't you put the bells up yourself?]] If only two bells are left, isn't it fairly easy to tell which goes where?",
  "playermale_29223": "About the bells, Evangeline –",
  "playermale_29224": "The bells are back up, Evangeline.",
  "playermale_29226": "Deek, Professor?",
  "playermale_29229": "I'll take that, thank you.",
  "playermale_29244": "Hello, Deek. Shall we continue?",
  "playermale_29246": "Hello, Deek. Is this the clearing you mentioned?",
  "playermale_29248": "Fixtures?",
  "playermale_29249": "Mallowsweet?",
  "playermale_29250": "It's a long story. But – thank you for your help.",
  "playermale_29251": "[[Research. How interesting.]] You're a researcher?",
  "playermale_29271": "They seem to be going deeper into the Forest.",
  "playermale_29272": "I wonder where they're going – ?",
  "playermale_29276": "[[I'm sure you'll get it.]] Don't worry, you'll get it in the end.",
  "playermale_29277": "[[Perhaps you just need a bit more practice.]] A little more practice ought to do it.",
  "playermale_29278": "[[Your casting needs work.]] I'd say your wandwork could be a bit more fluid.",
  "playermale_29280": "Hope this isn't as precarious as it looks.",
  "playermale_29289": "[[I wish you luck.]] Well, good luck with it. It was nice to meet you, Cressida.",
  "playermale_29290": "[[How hard is it to cast nonverbal spells?]] Is it really that difficult to cast nonverbally?",
  "playermale_29295": "[[Nice meeting you, Garreth.]] Well, it was nice meeting you, Garreth. And thank you for the insights on your aunt.",
  "playermale_29296": "[[What's that in your mug?]] Are you having Butterbeer for breakfast?",
  "playermale_29298": "Goodness!",
  "playermale_29299": "[[Nice to meet you.]] I'm sure I'll be seeing you around – either in our common room or when you scale your next tower.",
  "playermale_29303": "[[What are people saying about my travels here?]] What exactly are the rumours about my journey to Hogwarts?",
  "playermale_29306": "I think I should turn around.",
  "playermale_29307": "I should probably turn back.",
  "playermale_29308": "Hm. Not sure this is the right way.",
  "playermale_29309": "Perhaps I should go the other way.",
  "playermale_29310": "This is not the right direction.",
  "playermale_29311": "Hm. Better turn around.",
  "playermale_29312": "This doesn't seem to be the right way.",
  "playermale_29313": "Perhaps the other way's more promising.",
  "playermale_29314": "Perhaps I'm heading the wrong way.",
  "playermale_29315": "Let's try the other way, perhaps.",
  "playermale_29316": "I should come back to this another time.",
  "playermale_29317": "I don't think I can do this now. Best to come back.",
  "playermale_29318": "Perhaps I'll come back to this.",
  "playermale_29319": "I don't think I'm ready for this just yet.",
  "playermale_29320": "I don't think I can tackle this just yet.",
  "playermale_29331": "[[Sounds intriguing.]] Exclusive and unsanctioned?  Count me in.",
  "playermale_29332": "[[Sounds suspicious.]] Unsanctioned? I don't know. School rules are in place for a reason.",
  "playermale_29380": "About what we discussed, Nerida –",
  "playermale_29391": "O.W.L.s? 'Owls'?",
  "playermale_29415": "[[You got me into trouble.]] Professor Sharp wasn't happy. Leave me out of your grand plans next time.",
  "playermale_29416": "[[It was nothing.]] Professor Sharp was annoyed but we sorted it out. No harm.",
  "playermale_29420": "These dry vines are one spark away from becoming kindling.",
  "playermale_29421": "This must be the entrance to the Hidden Herbology Corridor.",
  "playermale_29422": "Devil's Snare. Seems to thrive in darkness – perhaps it doesn't care for light.",
  "playermale_29423": "Seems the Devil's Snare was protecting a chest of some kind.",
  "playermale_29425": "I'm going to have to use <i>Accio</i> to get to those books.",
  "playermale_29426": "Got it. Only four more to go.",
  "playermale_29427": "That's the last book. Now to take them back to Cressida.",
  "playermale_29428": "[[That's amazing.]] That sounds brilliant, actually.",
  "playermale_29430": "[[Seems a lot of work just to carry books.]] That sounds a rather complicated way to simply avoid carrying your books.",
  "playermale_29432": "[[If I have time.]] I suppose I could help – if I have the time.",
  "playermale_29433": "Sebastian told me to see you about a club.",
  "playermale_29435": "[[I'll join your club.]] Of course. Duelling's an entertaining pastime.",
  "playermale_29436": "[[I'm not sure I'm interested.]] Don't really see the value in organised duelling. Senseless fighting, in my opinion.",
  "playermale_29442": "[[I'm ready.]] Get me in the ring.",
  "playermale_29443": "[[Not now.]] Perhaps later.",
  "playermale_29447": "Hello, Lucan. I wanted to talk to you about Crossed Wands.",
  "playermale_29450": "How does Crossed Wands work, exactly?",
  "playermale_29463": "[[They can be scary.]] Oh, they seem innocent but their tongues can be most disturbing.",
  "playermale_29464": "[[Are you afraid of your own shadow, too?]] Surely you're joking. You can't possibly be afraid of a Puffskein.",
  "playermale_29466": "[[I'm not serious.]] Only teasing. We had an arrangement.",
  "playermale_29467": "[[You'll learn a lesson from this.]] I'm doing you a favour. Disappointment like this will encourage you to become a stronger person.",
  "playermale_29468": "Professor Weasley?",
  "playermale_29470": "Hmm. Somewhere away from prying eyes.",
  "playermale_29486": "I imagine the bells are just inside in the Bell Tower.",
  "playermale_29487": "Ah – found them!",
  "playermale_29492": "It seems as if that might come in handy.",
  "playermale_29495": "[[No, sir. That's far too generous of you.]] That's very kind of you, Mr Hill, but I can't accept robes that I didn't pay for.",
  "playermale_29496": "[[Thank you, sir.]] Thank you, Mr Hill. That's very generous of you.",
  "playermale_29513": "[[I've had some good luck.]] I suppose it must seem that way. I'm not sure it's justified; it's often been a matter of circumstance.",
  "playermale_29515": "[[What's to be scared of?]] They're adorable. Why would you be afraid of a Puffskein?",
  "playermale_29516": "[[That's unkind.]] I'm sorry to hear that. Words can be cruel.",
  "playermale_29517": "[[That's actually funny.]] I'm sorry, but you have to admit that's rather clever.",
  "playermale_29518": "The 'Hidden Herbology Corridor'?",
  "playermale_29556": "Mr Weekes, I was able to set a record on my broom.",
  "playermale_29558": "Good news, Mr Weekes. With your upgrade, I was able to set a new record at the Irondale course.",
  "playermale_29559": "This looks like the portrait from the map. Now, where's the treasure?",
  "playermale_29560": "Ah, a rhinoceros skeleton. I'm on the right track.",
  "playermale_29561": "There's the fountain. I'm getting closer.",
  "playermale_29587": "Hello, Deek. Can you remind me how to use the nab-sack?",
  "playermale_29598": "What am I meant to be doing now, Deek?",
  "playermale_29600": "[[What if I can't find any beasts?]] What if I can't find any beasts in their usual habitat?",
  "playermale_29605": "[[I'll try to rescue a Jobberknoll.]] Then I shall go and rescue a Jobberknoll.",
  "playermale_29610": "Thank you.",
  "playermale_29624": "[[I already have one.]] I've already rescued one, actually. Do you have another beast in mind for today?",
  "playermale_29627": "Deek – what am I meant to be doing again?",
  "playermale_29644": "Thank you.",
  "playermale_29647": "[[I wish you had been there.]] Perhaps Professor Fig's friend would have survived if we'd had your help.",
  "playermale_29648": "[[We had it handled.]] We handled it. And, I think you're underestimating the nature of a dragon. A broom would've been kindling.",
  "playermale_29652": "Are you all right?",
  "playermale_29653": "[[I'm sorry to hear that.]] I'm sorry the other students weren't more friendly.",
  "playermale_29655": "[[Gobstones? Interesting.]] Gobstones? Sounds like a fun challenge.",
  "playermale_29656": "[[Sounds awful.]] I haven't much interest in a game that sprays you with odours.",
  "playermale_29659": "[[I can't make any promises.]] I'll see what I can do.",
  "playermale_29663": "[[Any ideas as to how to reach them?]]Do you have any suggestions on how to get your Gobstones down from their hiding spots?",
  "playermale_29666": "Hello, Zenobia. What did you need help with?",
  "playermale_29667": "[[Sounds as if they overreacted.]] Rather an overreaction on their part.",
  "playermale_29668": "[[I'd have done the same.]] Sounds as if you caused a smelly situation and they responded accordingly.",
  "playermale_29673": "[[Why does everyone hate you?]] Everyone hates you? Why?",
  "playermale_29674": "Hello, Zenobia. I found all your Gobstones.",
  "playermale_29675": "[[Yes, of course.]] Of course. They are yours, after all.",
  "playermale_29677": "[[No, I think I'll keep them.]] I'm afraid I've decided to keep them. That'll teach you to stink up your classmates.",
  "playermale_29678": "[[Wonderful idea.]] I'm sure they'd be willing to play after the trouble spent getting them back. It's a fine idea.",
  "playermale_29679": "[[Terrible idea.]] That's a horrible idea. No one wants to get that awful stench all over them again.",
  "playermale_29681": "Common sense and basic magic.",
  "playermale_29683": "[[No, I was only joking.]] I'm only teasing. Of course you can have them.",
  "playermale_29684": "[[Yes. I would.]] Yes. Finders keepers I'm afraid.",
  "playermale_29693": "[[Farewell, then.]] Goodbye, Imelda.",
  "playermale_29696": "This must be locked from the other side.",
  "playermale_29699": "The key. Here it is!",
  "playermale_29703": "Are potions really that versatile?",
  "playermale_29729": "He was a friend of Professor Fig's who merely joined us for the ride.",
  "playermale_29732": "[[Nice to meet you.]] It was nice meeting you, Sebastian. I'll let you get back to your book.",
  "playermale_29738": "[[What were you reading?]] What book were you reading?",
  "playermale_29739": "[[You seem to know a lot about wizard chess.]] Are you a keen wizard chess fan? You knew that boy was going to lose the match.",
  "playermale_29743": "Hmm. Perhaps I should have a chat with Ominis.",
  "playermale_29748": "A journal entry. Signed by Noctua Gaunt.",
  "playermale_29749": "The dial requires focus.",
  "playermale_29751": "Matching the symbols did open it.",
  "playermale_29752": "Another dial solved.",
  "playermale_29757": "We're making progress.",
  "playermale_29758": "This journal entry – it mentions getting lost and being unwelcome.",
  "playermale_29761": "Ominis – your aunt wanted to change your family's traditions.",
  "playermale_29765": "[[Do you fly a lot?]] Do you have a lot of time to fly during school?",
  "playermale_29768": "Ominis. A skeleton.  And Noctua's last journal entry. She mentions being trapped here – blocked by an Unforgivable Curse.",
  "playermale_29796": "I couldn't help but overhear – did you mention Ranrok's Loyalists?",
  "playermale_29797": "Has the situation with Ranrok's Loyalists improved?",
  "playermale_29804": "[[What happened to your brother?]] How did your brother Bardolph end up in St Mungo's?",
  "playermale_29805": "[[I could run them out.]] I'm unfortunately quite familiar with Ranrok's Loyalists. Perhaps I can do something.",
  "playermale_29808": "[[Where have the Loyalists set up camp?]] You said Ranrok's Loyalists have set up camp here. Where, precisely?",
  "playermale_29809": "[[Why don't you leave Upper Hogsfield?]] Why don't you simply leave the area for now?",
  "playermale_29811": "Hello Madam Beaumont. Good news – I was able to clear out Ranrok's camps.",
  "playermale_29812": "[[It was difficult.]] It was harrowing and they dug in their heels, but I managed.",
  "playermale_29818": "Excuse me – did you say something about a 'Bardolph Beaumont?'",
  "playermale_29819": "Excuse me Mrs Sprottle – any news on Bardolph Beaumont's disappearance?",
  "playermale_29820": "[[Perhaps I can keep an eye out.]] I can certainly look out for him.",
  "playermale_29825": "Strictly speaking, it has. We were caught.",
  "playermale_29828": "Madam Beaumont – might I speak with you?",
  "playermale_29829": "Madam Beaumont – any news regarding your brother, Bardolph?",
  "playermale_29830": "Mrs Sprottle told me a little about your brother's disappearance.",
  "playermale_29833": "[[I'll keep an eye out for him.]] I'll let you know if I see or hear anything about him.",
  "playermale_29837": "Past the river – near the Forest. I must be on the right track.",
  "playermale_29838": "Madam Beaumont? I believe I have some news of your brother.",
  "playermale_29839": "Madam Beaumont, I do have some news of your brother.",
  "playermale_29840": "[[I'm afraid he's dead.]] I regret to say that Bardolph had been turned into an Inferius. And – I had to kill him.",
  "playermale_29841": "[[He's decided to pursue a new life.]] I'm afraid he's joined the Ashwinders – and has no interest in returning.",
  "playermale_29843": "He was wearing a woollen jumper – hand-knitted.",
  "playermale_29844": "I'm truly sorry. I wish it had been better news. I wish you well, Madam Beaumont.",
  "playermale_29853": "Please, Ominis. I confided in you before about what happened with the Undercroft.",
  "playermale_29858": "After you, Professor.",
  "playermale_29878": "I officially have all of my supplies.",
  "playermale_29879": "Yes, dittany seeds, some spellcrafts and  some potion recipes.",
  "playermale_29881": "It worked! Ominis, you possess a rare ability indeed.",
  "playermale_29888": "[[I'll get your feather.]] Very well. I'll bring you a Fwooper feather.",
  "playermale_29890": "[[I should have helped you.]] It did sound like fun. I shouldn't have been so concerned with getting in trouble.",
  "playermale_29891": "[[I'm glad I didn't get involved.]] I'm glad I avoided trouble – Sharp certainly seemed upset with you.",
  "playermale_29893": "Noctua references painful and arduous challenges, but also rewards.",
  "playermale_29895": "[[I'd rather you ask him.]] You know him better than I do.",
  "playermale_29913": "[[Disrupted trade routes made you close?]] You said disrupted trade routes caused you to close Spintwitches?",
  "playermale_29918": "A new wand.",
  "playermale_29920": "Hello. Mr Weekes, is it?",
  "playermale_29942": "I – uh – that wasn't me, Professor. I'm new here.",
  "playermale_29945": "[[Bragbor. I know that name.]] Did you say Bragbor? I know that name. Lodgok said he was an ancestor of Ranrok.",
  "playermale_29950": "I came as soon as I could.",
  "playermale_29960": "[[Perhaps we can avoid detection.]] We need to see what they're doing, but let's not draw their attention.",
  "playermale_29961": "There they are up ahead.",
  "playermale_29964": "We make a good team.",
  "playermale_29967": "How nice. Nothing I haven't seen before.",
  "playermale_29969": "Fun is a relative term.",
  "playermale_29970": "Thank you, Professor.",
  "playermale_29985": "Once again, we could fight our way through – or be discreet.",
  "playermale_29986": "Perhaps we can find an alternate route up ahead.",
  "playermale_29991": "This mine looks like a tomb.",
  "playermale_30001": "Not at all. I'm choosing to see it all as one big adventure.",
  "playermale_30004": "I don't see any goblins in these webs.",
  "playermale_30009": "Too many. They definitely think there's something here they want.",
  "playermale_30010": "It's no wonder spiders give people goosebumps.",
  "playermale_30013": "Professor Hecat would be proud.",
  "playermale_30017": "We have another fight on our hands.",
  "playermale_30019": "Don't know why Gryffindors get credit for bravery. We Slytherins are teeming with it.",
  "playermale_30025": "Sebastian – I think I've found something! A canvas piece.",
  "playermale_30026": "Unless – we can find another passageway to the Undercroft. Let's have a look around.",
  "playermale_30029": "It has to fit.",
  "playermale_30036": "Please tell me you recognise the location in this bit of canvas.",
  "playermale_30037": "[[Have you ever encountered a dragon?]] I'd imagine most students have never seen a dragon. Have you?",
  "playermale_30038": "[[Could have gone worse.]] Well, I don't know about 'meticulous,' but I did as I was asked.",
  "playermale_30043": "I'm sorry – what do I need to do?",
  "playermale_30050": "[[It was nothing I couldn't handle.]] It is true. But I – we – handled it very well.",
  "playermale_30053": "Smashing.",
  "playermale_30072": "We're not finished yet.",
  "playermale_30084": "Excuse me?",
  "playermale_30085": "Oh. Well. Thank you.",
  "playermale_30086": "Didn't she stop that dragon skull from crushing you?",
  "playermale_30097": "How did you find this place?",
  "playermale_30102": "Really? Like what?",
  "playermale_30104": "[[It does sound dangerous.]] It sounds like a dangerous spell.",
  "playermale_30105": "[[That's ridiculous.]] A proper magical education ought to include all magic.",
  "playermale_30108": "Very well.",
  "playermale_30109": "It's a tad hot.",
  "playermale_30124": "Well, you took the fall for me. And that counts for something.",
  "playermale_30135": "[[Memorable? More like terrifying.]] I'd much rather have arrived on time and without a dragon attack en route.",
  "playermale_30136": "[[I do like to make an entrance.]] Well, if I'm going to make my mark here, I had to start right away.",
  "playermale_30137": "[[I'd be glad to help.]] It's definitely intriguing. I'd like to help you solve this mystery.",
  "playermale_30138": "[[If I have the time, but I make no promises.]] I'll see what I can do but I'm fairly busy. I can't promise anything.",
  "playermale_30144": "[[Nice meeting you.]] Thank you, Ominis. Very nice to meet you.",
  "playermale_30145": "[[Did you suspect you'd be in Slytherin?]] Were you expecting to be sorted into Slytherin?",
  "playermale_30146": "[[Do mermaids often appear outside the common room?]] Did that student say he thought he heard a mermaid?",
  "playermale_30148": "[[Why thank you.]] That's nice to hear. I have had my share of adventure. I hope my reputation's warranted.",
  "playermale_30150": "[[Hm. I suppose they could come in handy.]] I suppose they could prove useful outside of the greenhouse. Nothing wrong with a bit of backup. Even if it is from a cabbage.",
  "playermale_30151": "[[Sure, but that's just a dummy.]] Just because those cabbages will chomp on a dummy doesn't mean they'd do the same on, say, a goblin.",
  "playermale_30152": "[[I was imagining it already.]] Trust me Leander, I was imagining it the entire time.",
  "playermale_30159": "Yes, Professor.",
  "playermale_30160": "I tended to the Chinese Chomping Cabbages, Professor.",
  "playermale_30185": "What are we meant to be doing?",
  "playermale_30187": "[[Don't care much for plants, honestly.]] Thank you, Professor, but looking after plants isn't all that thrilling to me.",
  "playermale_30190": "Sounds lovely, but what I really need is this rotten roast beef.",
  "playermale_30194": "Not at all. Feenky sends her regards – along with the rotten roast beef.",
  "playermale_30196": "[[That's nice to hear.]] I'm flattered to hear that. Sebastian's not a bad duellist either.",
  "playermale_30198": "[[I did take him down a peg.]] I seem to have a knack for duelling.",
  "playermale_30200": "This is a change of pace from our last outing.",
  "playermale_30204": "I'm glad that Professor Weasley arranged for this visit to Hogsmeade.",
  "playermale_30205": "Whatever it was, it made very little sense.",
  "playermale_30206": "That's a powerful enchantment.",
  "playermale_30207": "I'll have to take your word for it, but that does sound disastrous.",
  "playermale_30208": "Neither do I, but he made a charming first impression.",
  "playermale_30209": "What were you and Ominis speaking about?",
  "playermale_30257": "<i>Stupefy</i> ought to make quick work of these pumpkins.",
  "playermale_30263": "[[Can most students cast nonverbally?]] Do most students know how to cast nonverbally?",
  "playermale_30285": "[[You don't mind students in here?]] Is it all right for students to wander into the kitchens?",
  "playermale_30286": "[[Are you restricted to certain foods?]] Are there any restrictions as to what you can make here?",
  "playermale_30287": "You're back.",
  "playermale_30288": "Listen, Professor. So much happened while you were away.",
  "playermale_30289": "Nearly Headless Nick asked me to get some rotten roast beef from the kitchens –",
  "playermale_30290": "Yes. And then I had to find Richard Jackdaw's head in the pumpkins so that he'd tell me about how he died.",
  "playermale_30291": "He was a student here long ago. Anyway, he told me about a secret cavern. I went there and, right next to Jackdaw's skeleton –",
  "playermale_30292": "Eldritch Diggory's portrait in the common room told me about his great-niece, Helen –",
  "playermale_30293": "Your friend, Mr Ollivander, sent me an owl asking for help finding an heirloom wand that was stolen from him –",
  "playermale_30294": "I received a flurry of messages from Professor Black's house-elf, Scrope.",
  "playermale_30295": "– I found the missing pages.",
  "playermale_30296": "[[I'd be happy to.]] Sounds simple enough. And who wouldn't want to go to Honeydukes?",
  "playermale_30297": "[[It sounds rather untoward.]] I don't know, Garreth. Secret passage to a cellar? Sounds like it's off-limits.",
  "playermale_30298": "[[Secret passage? Right up my street.]] Of course. You never know when you might need a quick means of escape from the castle.",
  "playermale_30300": "[[I can't wait to see what you brew up.]] You and your concoctions. I don't know how you come up with these things.",
  "playermale_30301": "[[Shouldn't you be studying?]] Where do you find the time for this – and your homework?",
  "playermale_30303": "[[I'll give it a try.]] I'll see what I can do, Garreth.",
  "playermale_30304": "What's down there?",
  "playermale_30306": "I wonder if Adelaide's uncle could be down there?",
  "playermale_30307": "Hello, Garreth. I have those dried Billywig stings.",
  "playermale_30308": "[[Here they are.]] Happy to help. Here you go.",
  "playermale_30309": "[[All yours! – for a fee.]] Getting them was more work than I expected. I'd like to be paid for my time.",
  "playermale_30320": "Hello. Can you point me in the direction of the rubbish?",
  "playermale_30321": "Who knew all of this was going on right beneath our feet?",
  "playermale_30322": "I've gained a new appreciation for breakfast.",
  "playermale_30323": "There's nothing like a meal prepared by a house-elf.",
  "playermale_30324": "It smells glorious in here.",
  "playermale_30325": "Hmm. Here's some beef, but it's not rotten. I'd best keep looking.",
  "playermale_30326": "Here's a welcome treat. Delicious.",
  "playermale_30327": "Pardon me, but can you point me to the rubbish?",
  "playermale_30328": "Oof. There's a disgusting smell. I must be getting close.",
  "playermale_30332": "[[Can't someone buy them for you?]] Couldn't you have someone buy the dried Billywig stings?",
  "playermale_30333": "[[Isn't this stealing?]] Are you asking me to steal from a shop?",
  "playermale_30336": "Another note?",
  "playermale_30337": "I need to get that note down.",
  "playermale_30338": "I need to retrieve that note.",
  "playermale_30339": "I don't think I can get to that note – I'll have to bring it to me.",
  "playermale_30340": "Ah – the bells must be upstairs.",
  "playermale_30341": "One up, one to go.",
  "playermale_30342": "I'll have to get those up there somehow – <i>Wingardium Leviosa</i>, perhaps?",
  "playermale_30343": "Well, that wasn't too hard. Evangeline should be pleased about this – even if Black isn't.",
  "playermale_30346": "[[How will this benefit me?]] I suppose I could. But why should I spend my time on a glorified errand?",
  "playermale_30351": "The statues Mr Ollivander mentioned must be upstairs amongst the owls.",
  "playermale_30352": "Don't mind me, owls. I'm here to help a friend. Now, where are those statues?",
  "playermale_30355": "Empty perches. Could be the right size for jackdaws. Or, statues of jackdaws.",
  "playermale_30360": "That's it.",
  "playermale_30365": "Not my best.",
  "playermale_30374": "You wanted to see me, sir?",
  "playermale_30375": "[[Justice must be served.]] I'll do whatever I can.",
  "playermale_30377": "[[Murder? Sounds intriguing.]] This could be right up my street. Even we Hufflepuffs enjoy a good mystery.",
  "playermale_30379": "How do you know about the book – and the pages?",
  "playermale_30385": "Madam Thistlewood? I met your great-uncle in his portrait in my common room. He sent me to speak to you.",
  "playermale_30390": "Sir? Why do I need to complete these tasks again?",
  "playermale_30394": "Perhaps Sir Affpuddle is upstairs.",
  "playermale_30396": "[[That's a shame.]] Pity goblins and wizards can't get along.",
  "playermale_30397": "[[I'm not surprised.]] Goblins and wizardkind will never trust each other.",
  "playermale_30405": "[[Thank you.]] Thank you. I need to find those pages – to help a friend.",
  "playermale_30411": "Let's play Summoner's Court.",
  "playermale_30413": "Aha. There's bound to be something up there.",
  "playermale_30418": "[[Sounds intriguing.]] Of course, Mr Ollivander. Sounds most up my street.",
  "playermale_30419": "[[Happy to undermine authority if it benefits me.]] Undermining the Headmaster and getting something in return? – Continue.",
  "playermale_30424": "[[Do you conjure the food here?]] Do you and the other house-elves conjure the food served in the Great Hall?",
  "playermale_30429": "Is everything all right?",
  "playermale_30430": "I take it you're Alexandra's 'friend'.",
  "playermale_30431": "It's done, Alexandra. I – took care of him.",
  "playermale_30432": "I feel awful for Alexandra. But the hamlet needed to be saved from that troll.",
  "playermale_30433": "Yes. Very nice.",
  "playermale_30434": "That's how you do it.",
  "playermale_30435": "Excellent.",
  "playermale_30436": "There we go.",
  "playermale_30438": "Not quite.",
  "playermale_30442": "Well, that wasn't ideal.",
  "playermale_30455": "Pardon me, is everything all right?",
  "playermale_30460": "[[No need to be upset.]] Come now, Leander. There's no need for that.",
  "playermale_30461": "[[That wasn't luck.]] I'm not lucky, I'm simply better than you.",
  "playermale_30462": "Samantha, about Summoner's Court –",
  "playermale_30463": "Hello, Grace. Let's play Summoner's Court.",
  "playermale_30464": "Hello Charlotte. Let's play Summoner's Court.",
  "playermale_30465": "Professor, I'd like to play a game of Summoner's Court.",
  "playermale_30470": "An encampment. This must be it.",
  "playermale_30471": "Arn, I have good news. Your carts are on their way back.",
  "playermale_30472": "That was quite something.",
  "playermale_30474": "Hello, Lucan. Is the next round of Crossed Wands all set?",
  "playermale_30475": "[[Ready for another round.]] I'm ready. Let's do it.",
  "playermale_30476": "[[Not right now.]] Not at the moment.",
  "playermale_30478": "Hello, Lucan. Is the final round of Crossed Wands ready?",
  "playermale_30482": "Hello, Lucan. Is the final round of Crossed Wands ready?",
  "playermale_30483": "[[Absolutely.]] I certainly am.",
  "playermale_30484": "[[Not now.]] I'm not quite ready yet.",
  "playermale_30485": "[[Very well.]] Yes, I'm ready now.",
  "playermale_30486": "[[Not right now.]] No, I don't think so. Not right now.",
  "playermale_30493": "[[It's an honour.]] I'm just pleased to have done as well as I did.",
  "playermale_30494": "[[I got lucky.]] It was mostly luck, that's all.",
  "playermale_30495": "[[I'm just getting started.]] That was nothing. I'm just getting started.",
  "playermale_30500": "He did. We were talking about Hogwarts founders and he mentioned it. Wouldn't say much more, though.",
  "playermale_30502": "He did. We were talking about our house founder and he mentioned it. Wouldn't say much more, though.",
  "playermale_30505": "Could this be Mr Oakes's campsite?",
  "playermale_30506": "Hello? Mr Oakes?",
  "playermale_30507": "[[Tell me about the ring.]] Tell me more about this treasured ring.",
  "playermale_30508": "Down to the water's edge. Hmm. This had better not be a trick.",
  "playermale_30509": "A lift. Must be how I get down. Looks broken though –",
  "playermale_30510": "I'm trapped. How am I supposed to get out of here?",
  "playermale_30511": "This – looks a bit dangerous.",
  "playermale_30516": "What do you mean your own troll?",
  "playermale_30519": "Concerning your troll –",
  "playermale_30520": "[[Who's Barnabas the Barmy?]] Who's Barnabas the Barmy?",
  "playermale_30521": "[[What were you training the troll to do?]] What exactly were you training the troll to do?",
  "playermale_30523": "[[Keep practising.]] Chin up, Leander. Keep practising, and you'll get better.",
  "playermale_30525": "[[You're clearly not cut out for this.]] Leander, there's no easy way to say this – well, actually there is. You're not cut out for it.",
  "playermale_30526": "[[Thank you.]] Thank you. It's been an honour.",
  "playermale_30528": "[[I don't know that I deserve this.]] I'm flattered, but I don't deserve such an honour.",
  "playermale_30532": "[[I'll see what I can learn.]] I'll try and look into it for you, Adelaide.",
  "playermale_30534": "Yes sir.",
  "playermale_30535": "Arn. About your carts –",
  "playermale_30536": "It's all right; there we go.",
  "playermale_30537": "Well, that didn't work. Perhaps something with a bit more force.",
  "playermale_30538": "Dead end. Must be another way in.",
  "playermale_30539": "That looks as if it might raise the gate.",
  "playermale_30540": "I hope Natty stays out of trouble.",
  "playermale_30541": "Not the safest place to sneak into.",
  "playermale_30542": "So much for my efforts at concealment.",
  "playermale_30543": "I hope Natty's having an easier time of it.",
  "playermale_30544": "Oh no! Deek was right. We need to save you from these barbarians.",
  "playermale_30547": "Yes. She used to be an Auror. Well, she took me to Azkaban to meet Anne Thisbe –",
  "playermale_30548": "– and so I went to the Owlery, like he said. And there were all these statues.",
  "playermale_30549": "Yes. I thought it was odd too. He asked me to meet him and then told me to take the toast –",
  "playermale_30555": "[[Not right now.]] Perhaps later. I have other things to do.",
  "playermale_30556": "Quite an experience. But, you see, Anne knew Richard Jackdaw before he died. So I had to find his ghost.",
  "playermale_30557": "Yes. Which led me to a secret hideout where I found Richard Jackdaw's ghost –",
  "playermale_30558": "– to a cave under the lake. That's where I found Richard Jackdaw's ghost.",
  "playermale_30559": "Yes. I thought it was odd too. But then we took the roast beef to Sir Podmore of the Headless Hunt and –",
  "playermale_30560": "That did it.",
  "playermale_30561": "Why me?",
  "playermale_30567": "I know just the spell to repair this armour.",
  "playermale_30568": "That wasn't so difficult after all. Now, to find that book.",
  "playermale_30569": "Conjuring?",
  "playermale_30574": "[[You did what you could.]] There wasn't much you could've done. He was beyond training. Tried to kill me the entire time.",
  "playermale_30575": "Hello, Lodgok. Sirona said I might find you here.",
  "playermale_30577": "Hello, Garreth. What exactly did you want me to do again?",
  "playermale_30578": "I suppose you could call it 'eventful.' I certainly wasn't expecting a troll attack.",
  "playermale_30585": "Now that’s more like it.",
  "playermale_30587": "What a view.",
  "playermale_30588": "Ah!",
  "playermale_30591": "Hello. Nice to meet you.",
  "playermale_30592": "Nice to see you again.",
  "playermale_30593": "[[May I ask about your shop and this hamlet?]] I'd like to ask you a few things, if you don't mind.",
  "playermale_30594": "[[I'm just looking.]] Just having a look around, if that's all right.",
  "playermale_30595": "[[What can you tell me about this hamlet?]] Would you mind telling me a little about Keenbridge?",
  "playermale_30596": "[[What is your background?]] How did you come to live here in Keenbridge?",
  "playermale_30597": "[[What can you tell me about this shop?]] What sorts of things do you sell?",
  "playermale_30602": "[[I shall keep an eye out.]] I'm sorry this happened to you. I shall certainly keep an eye out for your carts.",
  "playermale_30609": "A Demiguise?",
  "playermale_30613": "[[I'd be happy to help.]] I'd be glad to help you, Mr Moon.",
  "playermale_30614": "[[I don't want to get in trouble.]] The Faculty Tower? I'm not sure I should be going in there.",
  "playermale_30615": "[[What's in it for me?]] Why would I do this? Seems all risk and no reward.",
  "playermale_30616": "Hmm. I wonder what that does.",
  "playermale_30617": "That wasn't too bad.",
  "playermale_30618": "Ha! Good, I've got this!",
  "playermale_30621": "Brilliant. Count me in.",
  "playermale_30624": "[[Yes, I would.]] Yes. Don't count me out yet.",
  "playermale_30625": "[[No, thank you.]] Perhaps later.",
  "playermale_30627": "[[It is a bit ludicrous.]] I'm inclined to agree with them. Trolls are dangerous creatures.",
  "playermale_30628": "[[It's brave of you to try.]] It certainly takes a lot of courage to try, I'll give you that.",
  "playermale_30629": "[[What's a spellcraft?]] I've never heard of a spellcraft before Professor. What is it?",
  "playermale_30631": "You call that duelling?",
  "playermale_30632": "Don't take it so badly.",
  "playermale_30633": "Come on, then!",
  "playermale_30634": "Care to try me?",
  "playermale_30635": "This is starting to hurt.",
  "playermale_30636": "Perhaps a potion would help.",
  "playermale_30637": "This isn't going well.",
  "playermale_30638": "What potions do I have?",
  "playermale_30641": "[[Remind me, why can't you remove the statues yourself?]] Why can't you get the Demiguise moons yourself?",
  "playermale_30642": "[[Who do you suspect planted the statues?]] Do you know who is behind the Demiguise statues?",
  "playermale_30647": "[[I've rescued one already.]] Actually, I've already rescued one.",
  "playermale_30648": "[[Of course. What can I do for you?]] Happy to help – especially if you can shed light on the book.",
  "playermale_30649": "[[I'd rather not risk trouble with Black.]] I'm not so sure about this. I don't need the Headmaster upset with me.",
  "playermale_30650": "What's this all about? Your notes mentioned the book I found in the Restricted Section.",
  "playermale_30651": "I'm sorry to hear that. But – how do you benefit if I find the pages?",
  "playermale_30654": "[[How did you know about the book I found?]] How did you know that I'd found a book and that it's missing pages?",
  "playermale_30655": "[[I'm not sure I'm up to the task.]] I don't know, Mr Ollivander. Perhaps Professor Fig overestimates my abilities.",
  "playermale_30656": "Richard Jackdaw?",
  "playermale_30657": "[[Why don't you continue searching the Owlery?]] Surely you could continue searching the Owlery.",
  "playermale_30659": "[[How did you lose your head?]] I think I can guess how you died – but who did it to you?",
  "playermale_30665": "[[I shall head there directly.]] I shall go and see her right away.",
  "playermale_30666": "That sounds terrible – but I'm not sure how I can help.",
  "playermale_30667": "[[I'll come with you to Azkaban if it will save her.]] What a horrible story. If you think I can help, I'll come with you.",
  "playermale_30668": "[[I'm not sure I want to visit Azkaban.]] I'd rather not go to Azkaban. Is there no other way to help?",
  "playermale_30669": "[[Anything to see Azkaban.]] I've always wanted to see Azkaban. Count me in.",
  "playermale_30670": "A jackdaw. Just as Mr Ollivander said. Seen better days, I fear.",
  "playermale_30671": "I recognise those handles. The Summoning Charm should do the trick.",
  "playermale_30672": "Birds aren't afraid of heights. Perhaps I should look a bit higher.",
  "playermale_30673": "Deek?",
  "playermale_30674": "I'm a student. From Hogwarts.",
  "playermale_30675": "[[I think I understand.]] Are you saying that the missing pages are in a cave? Near Upper Hogsfield?",
  "playermale_30676": "[[Why must you be so cryptic?]] What are you trying to say? That the missing pages are in a cave? Near Upper Hogsfield?",
  "playermale_30677": "A vault. In some ruins. Near Upper Hogsfield? I suppose it can't hurt to look.",
  "playermale_30678": "But, Madam Thistlewood! I – all right. I'll find it. I'll find Jackdaw's cave.",
  "playermale_30679": "Very well. I'm listening.",
  "playermale_30680": "[[I'm ready to go.]] Very well. Let's go.",
  "playermale_30681": "This must be the place Anne told me about.",
  "playermale_30687": "[[I'll retrieve the relic.]] Very well, I'll retrieve the relic if you promise to share Ranrok's plans with me.",
  "playermale_30689": "[[This sounds like a trap.]] If I retrieve the relic, how do I know you'll tell me the truth about what Ranrok says?",
  "playermale_30693": "There they are. The Ashwinders.",
  "playermale_30694": "A retired Auror, Helen Thistlewood, told me about a map you stole from Peeves. And then Anne told me about a cave.",
  "playermale_30695": "[[Not well, I'm afraid.]] She was imprisoned in Azkaban for your murder. I fear the Dementors have taken an irreversible toll on her.",
  "playermale_30696": "[[You ruined her life.]] She was imprisoned in Azkaban for your murder. Why didn't you exonerate her?",
  "playermale_30697": "I'm glad to hear it. Before you go, would I still be able to find the pages with the map Helen mentioned?",
  "playermale_30704": "I gave it my all.",
  "playermale_30706": "[[Yes, I would.]] I'll give it another go.",
  "playermale_30707": "[[No, thank you.]] I think I'd better rest for a bit.",
  "playermale_30708": "Nice to meet you, Ominis.",
  "playermale_30710": "Hello again, Mr Moon.",
  "playermale_30713": "I hear them.",
  "playermale_30715": "Pardon? Were you calling to me?",
  "playermale_30718": "Miss Moffett, I caught Gwyneira.",
  "playermale_30719": "Pardon me sir, I'm here for the spellcrafts Professor Weasley ordered.",
  "playermale_30720": "I'm afraid I haven't yet, sir.",
  "playermale_30721": "That's certainly something to aspire to, Mr Brown. I look forward to that day.",
  "playermale_30723": "Hello, Miss Coffey. How are you?",
  "playermale_30724": "[[I'm sorry to hear that.]] I'm sorry to hear that your pet is missing.",
  "playermale_30725": "[[It's just a Niffler.]] I shouldn't worry about it. It's only a Niffler.",
  "playermale_30726": "[[I'll try and find your Niffler.]] I'll keep an eye out for Rococo.",
  "playermale_30729": "What did you need me to help you with, Miss Coffey?",
  "playermale_30733": "[[Tell me more about Henrietta.]] Why did Henrietta feel the need to protect her house like she did?",
  "playermale_30735": "[[Why don't you get him yourself?]] Why don't you just get Rococo back yourself?",
  "playermale_30736": "Wait. How do you know about the book? And that it's missing pages?",
  "playermale_30737": "Nice to meet you, Sir Nicholas.",
  "playermale_30738": "Sir Nicholas? You were looking for me?",
  "playermale_30739": "[[Thank you. I should be going.]] It was nice to meet you. Thank you for the beef.",
  "playermale_30740": "This is all rather cryptic, Sir Nicholas. What's going on?",
  "playermale_30743": "Made it. Did anyone else see that?",
  "playermale_30744": "This is rather fun.",
  "playermale_30745": "Brilliant.",
  "playermale_30753": "'Headless activities'?",
  "playermale_30754": "[[Very well. Sounds intriguing.]] Very well. I'd like to meet Sir Patrick myself – and see this 'Headless Hunt.'",
  "playermale_30757": "[[The roast beef wasn't for you?]] I thought the rotten roast beef was for you.",
  "playermale_30759": "Pardon me sir, I'm here for the seeds Professor Weasley arranged for me to collect.",
  "playermale_30761": "Miss Coffey, I found your Niffler!",
  "playermale_30762": "[[Of course.]] I'm sure he'll be happy to go home.",
  "playermale_30767": "More treasure. Rococo must have been through here.",
  "playermale_30768": "Treasure. That Niffler's certainly leaving quite a trail.",
  "playermale_30769": "These coins must have come from Miss Coffey's Niffler.",
  "playermale_30770": "I should follow the treasure to find that Niffler.",
  "playermale_30771": "There it is, just as Jackdaw described.",
  "playermale_30773": "I wonder how big this place is.",
  "playermale_30775": "These runes must have something to do with opening this door.",
  "playermale_30776": "Locked. Damn.",
  "playermale_30777": "I think I see. I'll need to cast more quickly.",
  "playermale_30778": "I need to hurry things up. The runes have reset.",
  "playermale_30779": "The runes go dark if I wait too long.",
  "playermale_30780": "I suppose I should do this a bit quicker.",
  "playermale_30781": "It appears that one glowing rune alone is not going to solve this puzzle.",
  "playermale_30782": "I think I'll need to light all of these.",
  "playermale_30783": "That one's gone dark. This will take more than one.",
  "playermale_30784": "That didn't stay glowing for long, and the door didn't open. Hmm.",
  "playermale_30785": "Impressive. That must be where this all leads.",
  "playermale_30786": "Someone didn't want casual visitors down here.",
  "playermale_30787": "I wonder if any of my spells will help me through this.",
  "playermale_30789": "That's odd, I'd have thought Jackdaw would have been interested in this loot, but there's no sign of him.",
  "playermale_30790": "I'd say the Summoning Charm would come in handy right about now.",
  "playermale_30791": "I wonder if I can move that platform somehow.",
  "playermale_30793": "That platform ought to be able to float straight to me.",
  "playermale_30794": "If I could summon that platform to me, I could likely get on it.",
  "playermale_30795": "Another puzzle. Well, if Jackdaw could solve this, so can I.",
  "playermale_30796": "There must be another rune somewhere around here.",
  "playermale_30798": "Not at all. I need to speak to Richard Jackdaw. Sir Patrick said his head might be around here somewhere.",
  "playermale_30799": "[[I'll rescue a Mooncalf.]] I shall go and find a Mooncalf then.",
  "playermale_30803": "We meet again, Richard Jackdaw. Shame. Those splinters must be what's left of Ollivander's wand. At least I can take the pages.",
  "playermale_30804": "Oh no. The room's starting to – flood?",
  "playermale_30806": "It's a good thing Jackdaw didn't fall down there.",
  "playermale_30807": "I'm not going to touch those. Eww.",
  "playermale_30808": "More spiders? These can't be what beheaded Richard Jackdaw.",
  "playermale_30811": "Farewell, monster. I can only imagine how these spiders have multiplied since Jackdaw came this way.",
  "playermale_30812": "There it is! The bridge. It's almost complete.",
  "playermale_30813": "I must be getting closer to Jackdaw's remains – and those pages.",
  "playermale_30814": "There's Jackdaw, looking dead as ever. What happened here? Might it happen again?",
  "playermale_30815": "May as well have a look around before I collect the pages.",
  "playermale_30816": "I should collect what I came for and be on my way.",
  "playermale_30817": "Wh – that's unnerving. What's happening?",
  "playermale_30818": "I've seen this before – in Gringotts and the Restricted Section.",
  "playermale_30819": "That must be the way out of here.",
  "playermale_30821": "I can only hope this magic protects me until I'm able to make my way out of here.",
  "playermale_30822": "Where am I?",
  "playermale_30826": "I'm – back at Hogwarts?",
  "playermale_30827": "Professor Weasley sent me to collect some recipes. I'm new at Hogwarts.",
  "playermale_30828": "Pardon me, sir –",
  "playermale_30830": "[[I have no regrets.]] It was worth losing a few house points for that detour.",
  "playermale_30831": "[[I wish we hadn't got in trouble.]] Perhaps. But we did get in trouble and Kogawa could hold it against us.",
  "playermale_30837": "I suppose not.",
  "playermale_30846": "Is someone down there?",
  "playermale_30848": "Seems to be some sort of map.",
  "playermale_30850": "[[Do you know why Ranrok is working with Rookwood?]] It seems Ranrok and Rookwood are conspiring. Why would that be?",
  "playermale_30851": "I retrieved the helmet from the Ashwinders.",
  "playermale_30857": "Enchanted candles? Wonder where they're heading?",
  "playermale_30858": "I suppose a picnic in the Forbidden Forest could seem romantic to some.",
  "playermale_30864": "[[Slayer?]] Slayer?",
  "playermale_30865": "[[Vanquisher?]] Vanquisher?",
  "playermale_30866": "[[Whisperer?]] Whisperer?",
  "playermale_30867": "Hello.",
  "playermale_30871": "[[Are you saying someone died here?]] Someone died here?",
  "playermale_30875": "[[I'm ready.]] It all seems clear to me now that we're here.",
  "playermale_30880": "That's good news. He seems very nice.",
  "playermale_30885": "Hello. Is something the matter?",
  "playermale_30887": "[[I'll keep an eye out.]] I'll keep an eye out for your Mooncalf, Garnuff.",
  "playermale_30888": "[[Why would poachers want your Mooncalf?]] Why do you suppose the poachers took Biscuit?",
  "playermale_30890": "Garnuff, remind me again about your Mooncalf, Biscuit.",
  "playermale_30891": "Garnuff, I've rescued Biscuit.",
  "playermale_30899": "Excuse me, Madam? I thought I heard you say something.",
  "playermale_30900": "[[I do enjoy a good puzzle.]] An archaic puzzle? Sounds fascinating.",
  "playermale_30901": "[[I'm not a fan of puzzles.]] I'm afraid I don't find puzzles that engaging.",
  "playermale_30902": "[[I'll see what I can do.]] If I happen to see it, I'll have a look.",
  "playermale_30903": "Can you tell me again about the puzzle that you found?",
  "playermale_30904": "Mrs Twiddle? Your husband was right. The statue was part of a puzzle.",
  "playermale_30905": "Hello.",
  "playermale_30908": "[[Sounds frustrating.]] I can imagine that would be rather frustrating.",
  "playermale_30909": "[[Not an ideal choice of merchandise.]] Seems like a poor choice of inventory. Surely that's obvious?",
  "playermale_30910": "Sounds like stocking your shelves comes with some hazards.",
  "playermale_30911": "Perhaps it was your dealings with Fwoopers that led to the precarious idea of stocking Diricawls.",
  "playermale_30912": "Thank you, I will.",
  "playermale_30917": "You said you know what to do?",
  "playermale_30919": "Thank you for the warning.",
  "playermale_30920": "[[How did you lose your head?]] If you don't mind my asking, how did you lose your head?",
  "playermale_30921": "[[Is this all Apollonia's fault?]] Helen mentioned Apollonia Black. Did she set up Anne to take the fall?",
  "playermale_30923": "You sound as if you could use some help.",
  "playermale_30927": "[[Yes.]] I have them right here.",
  "playermale_30928": "Hello, Mr Ndiaye. Eddie Thistlewood sent me.",
  "playermale_30929": "[[No.]] Not yet, I'm afraid.",
  "playermale_30930": "[[Why are the goblins targeting Feldcroft?]] Do you have any idea why the goblins are attacking Feldcroft?",
  "playermale_30931": "[[I shall do what I can.]] I'll return with the cabbages as soon as I can.",
  "playermale_30932": "[[How do you know Eddie?]] How do you and Eddie know each other?",
  "playermale_30933": "Hello, again, Mr Ndiaye.",
  "playermale_30934": "[[For a fee.]] It wasn't easy battling Ashwinders and finding a Niffler in that house. I've earned a reward.",
  "playermale_30952": "Sir? Is everything all right?",
  "playermale_30954": "[[I'll do it.]] I'll get the Venomous Tentacula for you.",
  "playermale_30955": "[[I'm not comfortable with this.]] I'm not sure this is something a student should be doing on your behalf.",
  "playermale_30957": "Mr Barnes, about that Venomous Tentacula you wanted me to get.",
  "playermale_30958": "Hello, Mr Barnes. I have that Venomous Tentacula.",
  "playermale_30959": "[[I'm keeping him.]] Actually, he's taken a liking to me. So I've decided to keep him.",
  "playermale_30963": "Hurry!",
  "playermale_30964": "All right. Where would I find one?",
  "playermale_30965": "Are there any other beasts nearby?",
  "playermale_30971": "I'm glad Richard Jackdaw left a little something behind for me. But where could he be?",
  "playermale_30972": "Not a headless skeleton in sight, but I may as well help myself to this.",
  "playermale_30973": "An untouched chest? Jackdaw wasn't very thorough in his search of this cave.",
  "playermale_30974": "There you go.",
  "playermale_30975": "Good Kneazle.",
  "playermale_30976": "No, I'm not. Sir Nicholas said you might know the location of some pages I'm looking for.",
  "playermale_30980": "Ominis, I hadn't imagined we'd end up trapped like this.",
  "playermale_30983": "We meet again, Richard Jackdaw. Thank you for keeping these pages safe all these years.",
  "playermale_30987": "Hello, can I help you?",
  "playermale_30988": "[[An underwater adventure sounds like fun.]] Diving into the lake sounds like an adventure. Tell me more.",
  "playermale_30989": "[[Diving into the lake doesn't sound too appealing.]] I'm afraid I'm not keen on mucking about at the bottom of lakes.",
  "playermale_30992": "[[I'll have to think about this.]] It sounds dangerous. Especially for something of mere sentimental value.",
  "playermale_30995": "[[Should I know who your family are?]] You seemed to think I might've heard of the 'Bath Pinch-Smedleys.' Why would I know of your family?",
  "playermale_30999": "Grace, what is it you needed my help with?",
  "playermale_31001": "Hello, Grace. I followed your bearings on a dive in the Black Lake.",
  "playermale_31002": "[[I did – here you are.]] I did. I hope it makes your father happy.",
  "playermale_31003": "[[I did. And it's yours – for a price.]] I did. But it wasn't easy. I shall need to be compensated.",
  "playermale_31005": "That's really not funny.",
  "playermale_31013": "[[What is an astrolabe?]] What exactly is an astrolabe?",
  "playermale_31022": "[[Of course, Professor.]] I will, Professor.",
  "playermale_31023": "[[Is this an appropriate spell for students?]] Is this something we should be learning in school?",
  "playermale_31036": "I'll be fine, Mr Oakes. You get back to Adelaide. I assure you, her worries outweigh yours.",
  "playermale_31040": "I found the pages and the Map Chamber. Why would I need the book?",
  "playermale_31057": "'Golden Gobstones'?",
  "playermale_31058": "Can't say I recommend it, frankly. It's nice to meet you, Amit. I take it you like Astronomy?",
  "playermale_31064": "No one at school's going to believe this.",
  "playermale_31078": "Hello Deek. Professor Weasley said you had an idea.",
  "playermale_31079": "What's this?",
  "playermale_31080": "Oh!",
  "playermale_31081": "What was that?",
  "playermale_31082": "Was that a Golden Snitch?",
  "playermale_31093": "[[I find the stars fascinating.]] I hope Astronomy's on my schedule. It sounds interesting.",
  "playermale_31094": "[[I've never been one for star-gazing.]] I'm afraid I'm not much for memorising constellations. Enough to worry about on the ground.",
  "playermale_31099": "Nice to meet you, Samantha. Is dittany used in Wiggenweld Potion?",
  "playermale_31105": "[[Isn't it Hufflepuffs who like plants?]] An affinity for Herbology is more typical of a Hufflepuff than a Ravenclaw, isn't it?",
  "playermale_31136": "Hello.",
  "playermale_31137": "[[A change? Why not!]] Why not, I say. What sort of change?",
  "playermale_31138": "[[Er, I don't think so.]] I'm not sure what you mean, but I'm quite all right as I am.",
  "playermale_31142": "Is that your owl?",
  "playermale_31143": "Enjoying the view?",
  "playermale_31144": "[[What do you mean?]] Are you saying some spells aren't taught at Hogwarts? Which ones?",
  "playermale_31146": "[[I do have a lot to catch up on.]] I am a bit concerned. I have a lot of catching up to do.",
  "playermale_31147": "[[I'm not worried.]] I'm really not worried. I'm sure I'll be fine.",
  "playermale_31157": "These vines are as dry as kindling.",
  "playermale_31158": "[[Of course.]] It looks like a Graphorn.",
  "playermale_31159": "[[I'm not certain.]] That's a head? I can't say that I do.",
  "playermale_31160": "[[I’m ready.]] If that's what must be done, I'll do it.",
  "playermale_31163": "[[I have to subdue a Graphorn?]] Have you ever subdued a Graphorn, Professor?",
  "playermale_31167": "Very well, Lord of the Shore, show yourself.",
  "playermale_31168": "This must be the place.",
  "playermale_31169": "The Graphorn is somehow the key to opening the room.",
  "playermale_31180": "There it is again!",
  "playermale_31181": "That was for Highwing.",
  "playermale_31182": "[[Let's find our dragon then.]] Well, then. Let's find our dragon and return her egg.",
  "playermale_31184": "Can't we Apparate past them into the tower?",
  "playermale_31186": "It's more than mere coincidence that we encountered Ranrok's Loyalists here.",
  "playermale_31187": "Can't imagine the goblins know about the trials. They know that something is significant about this place, though.",
  "playermale_31203": "I presume I'm looking for traces of ancient magic. But where?",
  "playermale_31215": "[[I'd rather not.]] I don't want to fly right now. Perhaps later.",
  "playermale_31216": "[[I did. And I'm keeping it.]] I did find it. However, I've taken a liking to it so I'm going to keep it.",
  "playermale_31217": "I'm sorry – how exactly has he been cursed?",
  "playermale_31220": "Well, it is an unusual situation. How did your brother end up like this?",
  "playermale_31221": "[[Nice to meet you.]] It was nice meeting you, Lenora.",
  "playermale_31222": "[[Good luck, Arthur.]] Nice meeting you, Arthur. And good luck finding that cat.",
  "playermale_31223": "Nice to meet you too. Is everything all right?",
  "playermale_31228": "[[I nearly went deaf.]] I'll say. I nearly went deaf.",
  "playermale_31232": "Wait here. I'll run ahead to the next safe spot.",
  "playermale_31233": "[[Yes, I was.]] That one is true. Not the typical start to a new school.",
  "playermale_31234": "[[I'd rather not talk about it.]] If you don't mind, I'd prefer to just forget about it.",
  "playermale_31236": "[[Nice meeting you.]] Thank you, Adelaide. Be seeing you.",
  "playermale_31237": "What do you need help retrieving?",
  "playermale_31238": "Perhaps. What precisely do you need to retrieve and why?",
  "playermale_31239": "I'm so sorry. What happened to them?",
  "playermale_31240": "Finders keepers, Grace.",
  "playermale_31241": "[[As am I. Plants offer so much.]] Magical plants have so much to offer. I'm eager to learn more.",
  "playermale_31245": "[[Is your uncle all right?]] Are you sure everything is all right with your uncle?",
  "playermale_31254": "I already have some, Professor. Picked them up in Hogsmeade.",
  "playermale_31255": "Yes, Professor?",
  "playermale_31264": "[[You think you should've been a Ravenclaw?]] Do you really think you should have been in Ravenclaw?",
  "playermale_31276": "Remarkable.",
  "playermale_31279": "[[Have you ever had a pet?]] Have you ever had a pet, Arthur?",
  "playermale_31280": "Seems I need to find Mr Lawley's cellar.",
  "playermale_31281": "This must be it.",
  "playermale_31282": "Better not let Mr Lawley see me.",
  "playermale_31283": "Where is that Venomous Tentacula?",
  "playermale_31284": "So many spiders. It's a wonder they haven't taken over the whole house. ",
  "playermale_31285": "Now that I have the Venomous Tentacula, I should return to Mr Barnes.",
  "playermale_31287": "Perhaps one of these guards has the key.",
  "playermale_31288": "Could the phoenix be in there?",
  "playermale_31290": "Can I help you?",
  "playermale_31296": "[[I'll see what I can do.]] If you tell me where to go, I'll see what I can do about it.",
  "playermale_31298": "Sophronia, I solved all the puzzles in the Hall of Herodiana.",
  "playermale_31299": "[[Yes.]] Of course. Behold!",
  "playermale_31300": "[[Yes, for a fee.]] Of course, but not for free. That wasn't easy.",
  "playermale_31301": "[[No. You should have found it yourself.]] You were right about how spectacular it is. Which is why it's a pity you didn't find it yourself.",
  "playermale_31302": "This must be the entrance to the 'Hall of Herodiana.'",
  "playermale_31303": "Well, here it is: the Hall of Herodiana. Better go inside and find those puzzles.",
  "playermale_31309": "And this must be the last piece of Herodiana's ensemble. It is remarkable.",
  "playermale_31310": "That wasn't too hard. I wonder what's next.",
  "playermale_31311": "I think I'm getting the hang of this now. Just one left.",
  "playermale_31312": "Suppose I should look for that secret hall Sophronia told me about. It does sound interesting.",
  "playermale_31322": "Fig is an interesting wizard, to be sure. I imagine he could tell some stories.",
  "playermale_31330": "Hello again, Mr Thistlewood.",
  "playermale_31331": "[[Is Brocburrow safe?]] Do you stay close to home because it's safe in the hamlet?",
  "playermale_31332": "[[Don't you want to see the world?]] You never wanted to get out and explore the world around you?",
  "playermale_31338": "Hello.",
  "playermale_31339": "Helen Thistlewood, wasn't it?",
  "playermale_31340": "You sound like someone who's seen their share of the outside world.",
  "playermale_31341": "[[You were an Auror?]] What was it like being an Auror?",
  "playermale_31342": "[[Tell me about the Dark Arts.]] You must have some experience battling evil forces in the world.",
  "playermale_31345": "[[I just wanted to say hello.]] Just saying hello. It was nice to meet you.",
  "playermale_31346": "Sacharissa, I found the Bubotubers you needed.",
  "playermale_31347": "This is where Sacharissa said to go. Now where are those Bubotubers?",
  "playermale_31348": "That should do it. I'd better get back to Sacharissa now.",
  "playermale_31349": "This must be where the Pinch-Smedley family astrolabe is.",
  "playermale_31350": "I should let Grace know that I've found her family astrolabe.",
  "playermale_31351": "[[Of course.]] Of course. Happy to have found them for you.",
  "playermale_31352": "[[Yes, but for a higher price.]] It actually was a 'spot' of trouble. You never mentioned I might encounter a troll. I think you should pay me more.",
  "playermale_31356": "I'm ready to learn how to use the nab-sack.",
  "playermale_31369": "[[I'm sorry to hear that.]] Oh dear, that sounds awful.",
  "playermale_31370": "[[I'm not sure that's true.]] Did that really happen, or are you simply being overdramatic?",
  "playermale_31371": "[[What do you do for the Headmaster?]] What do you mean you do 'important work' for the Headmaster?",
  "playermale_31372": "Ferdinand Pratt thinks you should be. Says you 'stole his frame'.",
  "playermale_31373": "May I ask where you put him?",
  "playermale_31374": "[[Very well. Burning it is.]] You really oughtn't have said that.",
  "playermale_31375": "[[Returning you to the Three Broomsticks isn't my only option.]] What if I don't want to return you to the Three Broomsticks?",
  "playermale_31376": "[[I could burn you, but I won't.]] Tempting as a bonfire sounds, I think I'll spare you that fate.",
  "playermale_31377": "Goodbye, Ferdinand. Enjoy your new home.",
  "playermale_31378": "[[I know.]] It's no Three Broomsticks, that's for certain.",
  "playermale_31379": "[[It's not that bad.]] Oh, give it a chance. You might grow to like it.",
  "playermale_31383": "Oh, I see. Thank you anyway.",
  "playermale_31385": "Is everything all right, Madam – ?",
  "playermale_31386": "[[I might be able to help.]] I could take care of Selwyn for you.",
  "playermale_31389": "What did you need help with again?",
  "playermale_31390": "This must be the castle that Silvanus Selwyn and his thieves are in.",
  "playermale_31391": "If I can just get to him I should be able to disband the group.",
  "playermale_31393": "Selwyn has been taken care of.",
  "playermale_31394": "This must be the castle where Miss Coffey's Niffler ran away. Now to find a way inside.",
  "playermale_31395": "That's the end of them. Now I can focus on finding Rococo.",
  "playermale_31396": "This Niffler is a tricky one.",
  "playermale_31397": "Ugh. When I get my hands on that Niffler.",
  "playermale_31398": "I might as well grab the Niffler – I'm here now.",
  "playermale_31399": "Ashwinders!",
  "playermale_31400": "I hope Miss Coffey appreciates this.",
  "playermale_31401": "Never realised how tiring it can be to capture a Niffler.",
  "playermale_31402": "Best get back to Miss Coffey.",
  "playermale_31403": "What a dreadful lot.",
  "playermale_31404": "That 'hideaway' does sound intriguing. Perhaps I should investigate – for Rococo's sake.",
  "playermale_31405": "Ugh. More Ashwinders.",
  "playermale_31406": "I hope the Ashwinders haven't done anything with Rococo.",
  "playermale_31408": "[[Has this happened before?]] Has Ranrok's lot ever attacked you like this before?",
  "playermale_31412": "How many of you are there?",
  "playermale_31420": "Sebastian, look.",
  "playermale_31428": "Mr Weekes, what did you need from me?",
  "playermale_31429": "[[Can't wait to hear more. Goodbye.]] I'm excited to hear more.",
  "playermale_31432": "A time trial at the Quidditch pitch – sounds intriguing.",
  "playermale_31433": "I suspect Mr Weekes'll be glad to hear how I fared.",
  "playermale_31434": "I think this might be where I dive to reach the merpeople.",
  "playermale_31435": "Look at this place. Did the merpeople really leave Nerida an artefact?",
  "playermale_31436": "Now then. I'll need you to come with me.",
  "playermale_31437": "What do we have in here, then?",
  "playermale_31438": "Nerida will be happy about this.",
  "playermale_31439": "Now for the rest of you.",
  "playermale_31440": "Going for a swim?",
  "playermale_31441": "You're a liaison to the merpeople?",
  "playermale_31442": "[[I think what you're doing is admirable.]] I'm impressed. I think reaching out to the merpeople is a grand idea.",
  "playermale_31443": "[[I think you're wasting your time.]] I'm not sure this is a worthwhile endeavour. Do the merpeople even want to be 'liaised' with?",
  "playermale_31444": "[[Tell me about wizardkind's relationship with merpeople.]] How has wizardkind fallen short in its treatment of merpeople?",
  "playermale_31445": "[[What would a liaison to the merpeople do?]] What do you imagine a liaison to the merpeople would do?",
  "playermale_31446": "[[I can help you.]] Well, I can swim and could help you if you'd like.",
  "playermale_31450": "[[What's so interesting about merpeople?]] What is it about the merpeople that interests you so much?",
  "playermale_31451": "Your gift from the merpeople was exactly where they said it would be.",
  "playermale_31452": "[[Happy to have helped. Enjoy your gift.]] Then I'm glad we helped to foster some healthy diplomatic relations.",
  "playermale_31454": "[[I'll see what I can do.]] Very well, sir. I shall keep an eye out for two crates of Chinese Chomping Cabbages.",
  "playermale_31455": "Nice to meet you too, Madam Twiddle.",
  "playermale_31457": "[[Your whole training plan was doomed.]] Any plan you had to train that thing was doomed. He tried to kill me the entire time.",
  "playermale_31461": "[[I would like that.]] That sounds like a very good idea.",
  "playermale_31462": "[[Can't I simply rescue them?]] I don't know, Deek. Sounds a lot of work. Can't I just carry on rescuing beasts?",
  "playermale_31463": "I see. What do I need to do?",
  "playermale_31464": "[[Perhaps I can do it.]] I'm not thrilled at the prospect, but I'll consider it.",
  "playermale_31467": "[[It sounds a bit dangerous.]] Sounds a bit dangerous. I'd rather not risk running into poachers again.",
  "playermale_31468": "[[I'd better go and rescue it.]] Well, I'd better go and rescue it then, hadn't I?",
  "playermale_31470": "How is it that I can help you with your next broom upgrade?",
  "playermale_31471": "Off to the races, then.",
  "playermale_31472": "Another successful flight. I should let Mr Weekes know.",
  "playermale_31476": "Hmm. A map. It doesn't appear to be connected to the missing pages. Best hang onto it for now.",
  "playermale_31477": "Hmm. A map. I wonder where it leads?",
  "playermale_31478": "[[I've decided to keep the gift.]] I quite like the idea of an authentic, Mermish artefact. I'm tempted to keep it myself.",
  "playermale_31479": "[[I don't think you've earned it.]] If you really wanted this then perhaps you should have fetched it yourself.",
  "playermale_31480": "[[I'm teasing you. It's yours.]] I know, I know. I was only joking. It's all yours.",
  "playermale_31484": "The name makes sense now. And the secrecy.",
  "playermale_31486": "[[Why are the goblins attacking Feldcroft?]] Why would the goblins target Feldcroft?",
  "playermale_31487": "[[Couldn't you grow new cabbages?]] Could you not grow or buy more Chinese Chomping Cabbages?",
  "playermale_31489": "I need to deliver Chinese Chomping Cabbages to Bernard Ndiaye here in Feldcroft.",
  "playermale_31490": "I can see why Feldcroft needs help.",
  "playermale_31491": "Yes. I had to destroy a number of large vases, and that seemed to activate some sort of charm on the statue.",
  "playermale_31492": "I should look into the statue Madam Twiddle mentioned.",
  "playermale_31493": "This looks like the statue Madam Twiddle mentioned.",
  "playermale_31494": "Why are there so many vases around here?",
  "playermale_31495": "I suppose I should try to find all the vases.",
  "playermale_31496": "I think there should only be a few more vases.",
  "playermale_31497": "That's it! I should tell Madam Twiddle about what happened.",
  "playermale_31512": "Professor Sharp's class, yes.",
  "playermale_31513": "A little turbulent, and it's wanting for a bit of speed, but – it fared well enough.",
  "playermale_31516": "How deep are we going?",
  "playermale_31518": "I don't know. But, I found this floating above that – basin.",
  "playermale_31522": "I know a way out.",
  "playermale_31528": "Hmm – the location marked on the map isn't far from here.",
  "playermale_31530": "Certainly looks to be the place.",
  "playermale_31531": "Where in Merlin's name am I?",
  "playermale_31532": "This can't be it. Must be a way through.",
  "playermale_31533": "There we go.",
  "playermale_31534": "Should've expected company.",
  "playermale_31536": "I couldn't have done it without your help, Deek. Thank you.",
  "playermale_31537": "Wait. Is that the Hippogriff from my treasure map?",
  "playermale_31543": "Seems whoever enchanted those brooms was more concerned with cleanliness than with cooking.",
  "playermale_31544": "I wonder who this is?",
  "playermale_31545": "Someone was an avid reader. Can't say I'm familiar with many of these titles.",
  "playermale_31555": "Hello sir. I don't believe we've met.",
  "playermale_31557": "Well, that's everything. Better go and find Natty.",
  "playermale_31558": "There's the cabinet. How do I get this key in there?",
  "playermale_31559": "Hello, Nellie. I managed to get a Daedalian key into its lock.",
  "playermale_31560": "A curious token of some sort.",
  "playermale_31562": "A Daedalian Key. Wonder where it might lead me?",
  "playermale_31563": "This must be my house chest. I just need to insert the token.",
  "playermale_31564": "Here we are, the last house token. Time to see what's inside.",
  "playermale_31565": "Well, that didn't work.",
  "playermale_31566": "That's it!",
  "playermale_31567": "An old coin? Perhaps Nellie knows what it means.",
  "playermale_31568": "I should see this through and find the Gryffindor house chest.",
  "playermale_31569": "Seems I'll need to find more house tokens if I'm to open this. Quite a few, by the look of it.",
  "playermale_31570": "Well look at that. Thanks goes to the former Headmistress, Eupraxia Mole.",
  "playermale_31571": "Another house token for the house chest.",
  "playermale_31572": "This Daedalian Keys Challenge is coming along nicely.",
  "playermale_31573": "That's it. I'm making good progress with those tokens.",
  "playermale_31582": "[[I'll try and help, Mr Weekes.]] Sounds as if you're really outdoing yourself. If I'm able to help, I will.",
  "playermale_31584": "If it means another upgrade, the pleasure's all mine.",
  "playermale_31586": "It rides well. Does get a tad shaky at top speed – and the handle wobbles a bit when I hit a strong gust of wind.",
  "playermale_31593": "It seems happy to come with me. I wonder if it could travel in the nab-sack.",
  "playermale_31594": "Pardon me, sir –",
  "playermale_31595": "[[Perhaps I can look for the thief.]] I could keep an eye out for the thief, sir.",
  "playermale_31596": "Mr Haggarty, can you remind what we spoke about?",
  "playermale_31597": "I have some good news, Mr Haggarty. I unmasked your thief.",
  "playermale_31606": "Perfect. Let's see what we've got.",
  "playermale_31607": "This must be what all the fuss was about.",
  "playermale_31631": "What do you suppose we should be looking for?",
  "playermale_31641": "I see something up ahead!",
  "playermale_31643": "When I moved towards the glow, it suddenly seemed as if the ground was swirling about.",
  "playermale_31644": "Yes, sir. I'm fine.",
  "playermale_31656": "That statue. It looks like the symbol I've been seeing.",
  "playermale_31657": "That looks like a different room through the archway –",
  "playermale_31658": "Is there something I can help you with, Mr –?",
  "playermale_31660": "[[I'm sorry.]] I'm very sorry to hear about your friend.",
  "playermale_31661": "[[I think he did deserve it.]] Sounds like Milo knew exactly what he was in for – and risked your life as well.",
  "playermale_31662": "[[I may be able to help.]] If I have time, I can try to collect the heirloom watch, Mr Adley.",
  "playermale_31664": "Could you please remind me what you needed help with?",
  "playermale_31665": "Mr Adley, I retrieved the heirloom pocket watch from Milo's body.",
  "playermale_31666": "[[Here it is.]] I'm glad Milo's daughter will have something to remember him by.",
  "playermale_31667": "[[I'd like a reward.]] This was quite difficult to retrieve. Shouldn't I get a reward for my trouble?",
  "playermale_31668": "Now where could that Acromantula cave be?",
  "playermale_31669": "This could be the Acromantula cave Mr Adley mentioned.",
  "playermale_31670": "Now that's taken care of, I need to find the heirloom for Milo's daughter.",
  "playermale_31671": "I need to bring this heirloom back to Mr Adley.",
  "playermale_31672": "Flying tips and a jaunt around Hogwarts. This is quite the tour, Everett.",
  "playermale_31674": "Hello. Is there something I can help you with?",
  "playermale_31675": "[[How condescending.]] How – magnanimous.",
  "playermale_31676": "[[I'll try and find some for you.]] I can try and find some for you if I have the time.",
  "playermale_31681": "I – I'm not sure I know what you're talking about.",
  "playermale_31682": "Actually sir, the thief was a Niffler.",
  "playermale_31693": "Aaaa- haaaaah!",
  "playermale_31694": "It's incredible, isn't it!",
  "playermale_31695": "Ho – ohhhhh!",
  "playermale_31696": "[[Happy to help.]] I'm glad I could help protect Cragcroft from the Ashwinders.",
  "playermale_31697": "[[I need a bigger reward.]] Surely the safety of Cragcroft is worth more. I'd hate for the Ashwinders to know who offered a bounty on Selwyn.",
  "playermale_31702": "Is everything all right?",
  "playermale_31703": "Hazel?",
  "playermale_31704": "I'm sorry to hear that.",
  "playermale_31705": "[[I shall see what I can do.]] I'll keep an eye out for your unicorn friend and take her to safety if I see her.",
  "playermale_31709": "[[How did you become friends with her?]] How did you become so close with a unicorn?",
  "playermale_31711": "Hello, Mrs Bugbrooke. What was it you needed help with?",
  "playermale_31718": "Might be interesting to see where this leads.",
  "playermale_31719": "This looks like the entrance indicated on the map.",
  "playermale_31721": "Why is this door locked?",
  "playermale_31723": "Must be something around here I can climb on.",
  "playermale_31724": "Brilliant! The first piece of the puzzle.",
  "playermale_31725": "One down. Two to go.",
  "playermale_31728": "Success!",
  "playermale_31729": "Inferi! What are they protecting?",
  "playermale_31730": "Let's hope you stay dead this time.",
  "playermale_31731": "Hmm. The nine rocks on the map.",
  "playermale_31732": "That's odd. The markings are different on the map.",
  "playermale_31733": "Eureka!",
  "playermale_31734": "Glad to have got something after defeating those Inferi.",
  "playermale_31735": "Where on earth is this leading me?",
  "playermale_31741": "I'd say that I agree with you.",
  "playermale_31742": "Sounds like a good idea.",
  "playermale_31746": "Are you – holding your breath again?",
  "playermale_31747": "Oh, yes. She mentioned it to me. It contains some of her late husband's belongings.",
  "playermale_31749": "[[What was the heirloom she stole from you?]] What exactly was the family heirloom that the thief stole?",
  "playermale_31750": "[[Why would Catrin return to rob the hamlet?]] Why would Catrin come back to rob the hamlet if she'd already left?",
  "playermale_31751": "[[What makes you think Catrin did this?]] Are you sure Catrin is the culprit? It could be anyone.",
  "playermale_31752": "You got all of that from simply standing here?",
  "playermale_31753": "That's what Professor Rackham meant when he spoke of my needing an 'ability to interact with beasts.'",
  "playermale_31754": "Tell me more about what needs to be done, Professor.",
  "playermale_31770": "Professor Fig?",
  "playermale_31772": "You know – small, furry, pilfering? I followed it to its lair.",
  "playermale_31773": "[[I did find your heirloom.]] As a matter of fact I did.",
  "playermale_31774": "I'm sorry Mr Haggarty, I wish I could say that I had.",
  "playermale_31791": "[[There is, in fact.]] We did take a bit of a detour on the way here. Ended up exploring some ruins and – I shouldn't say more.",
  "playermale_31792": "[[I'm afraid there isn't.]] I'm sorry, Professor, but I'm afraid that's all there is to it.",
  "playermale_31793": "They did, Professor.",
  "playermale_31801": "Was this statue pointing the other way before?",
  "playermale_31802": "What was that?",
  "playermale_31804": "Appears there's a bit more to do before I can get through that door.",
  "playermale_31810": "Hello, Natty. How are you? I hope you've recovered from our rather eventful trip to Hogsmeade.",

  "playermale_32600": "I need to find something for Professor Fig, but it's in the Restricted Section of the Library.",
  "playermale_32601": "He was called away by Black at the last moment. I suppose I could wait to get a note from him, but –",
  "playermale_32602": "Precisely. You mentioned being 'clever enough not to get caught' in the Restricted Section.",
  "playermale_32606": "– the mallowsweet is meant to be placed at the centre of the symbols?",
  "playermale_32608": "That's what we're trying to find out.",
  "playermale_32611": "[[Happy to help.]] I'd be happy to help with the delivery.",
  "playermale_32612": "[[She sounds annoying.]] I'd rather not deal with difficult people, but for a reward I think I can manage.",
  "playermale_32613": "Sir? Could you remind me about the delivery you needed help with?",
  "playermale_32615": "[[Very well.]] (sigh) Very well, I shall let Mr Pippin know I delivered the potions as requested.",
  "playermale_32616": "Madam Lawang? I have a delivery from J. Pippin's Potions.",
  "playermale_32617": "[[Here are the potions.]] Here are the potions you requested.",
  "playermale_32618": "[[Why did you buy them then?]] Why do you keep ordering from him if you think the quality to be inferior?",
  "playermale_32619": "[[Of course.]] Seems simple enough. I'll do it.",
  "playermale_32620": "I delivered the potions to Fatimah Lawang.",
  "playermale_32621": "[[It was no problem.]] Nothing to worry about. I handled it.",
  "playermale_32622": "[[She's certainly difficult.]] I can see why you didn't want to go. She was quite cantankerous.",
  "playermale_32624": "Our interests will never be aligned.",
  "playermale_32625": "Charles Rookwood wouldn't have wanted you near it.",
  "playermale_32626": "I've no idea what you’re talking about.",
  "playermale_32628": "Imelda Reyes? Albie Weekes sent me –",
  "playermale_32633": "[[A goblin named Lodgok.]] A friendly goblin. He wants no part in Ranrok's fight.",
  "playermale_32634": "[[They asked me not to say anything.]] Someone who knows Ranrok personally. They asked me not to mention their name to anyone.",
  "playermale_32635": "[[That was cruel.]] Perhaps your uncle was right about you. You don't know when to stop.",
  "playermale_32636": "I do. I also see why you refer to this room as the 'Map Chamber.'",
  "playermale_32639": "So, the passage from your ruins to Gringotts, everything in the vault, the Restricted Section, finding this room – none of these was a trial?",
  "playermale_32644": "You're not a bad chap – for a Slytherin.",
  "playermale_32647": "I do. But, not all goblins – ",
  "playermale_32658": "What do we do now? Ominis is not going to cast the Cruciatus Curse again.",
  "playermale_32659": "Wait – you didn't say you knew how to cast <i>Crucio</i>.",
  "playermale_32660": "[[Teach me the Cruciatus Curse and I'll cast it on you.]] I want to learn the curse, and I think it's best if I cast it on you.",
  "playermale_32661": "[[I want to learn the Cruciatus Curse. But you must cast it on me.]] I want to learn the curse, but I won't cast it on you. You need to cast it on me.",
  "playermale_32662": "[[Very well. I don't want to learn the Cruciatus Curse.]] I don't want to learn the curse, but I can handle the pain. It's fine. Cast it on me.",
  "playermale_32665": "That pain – it was excruciating. But, I'll survive. Let's keep moving.",
  "playermale_32668": "Sebastian. Ominis. There's a book, just here.",
  "playermale_32672": "[[I'll see you at the forest.]] I suppose if that's the only way for me to get those pages, I'll meet you at the forest.",
  "playermale_32673": "[[Where are we to meet?]] Where did you suggest we meet?",
  "playermale_32674": "[[How did you steal from Peeves?]] How is it possible to steal from Peeves – a Poltergeist?",
  "playermale_32675": "[[I'll see you at the forest.]] If that's the only way for me to get those pages, I'll meet you there.",
  "playermale_32685": "[[I won't say a word.]] I see no reason to involve Ominis.",
  "playermale_32686": "[[We should tell Ominis.]] We need to tell him. He's the reason we found the book and he deserves to know what you've learned.",
  "playermale_32697": "What will you do with Slytherin's spellbook?",
  "playermale_32710": "[[The spellbook is giving Sebastian hope.]] Those references in the book seem promising.",
  "playermale_32712": "Did you get what you needed for your sister?",
  "playermale_32713": "Of course, Officer.",
  "playermale_32714": "I was happy to help.",
  "playermale_32719": "Oh? What's so special about them?",
  "playermale_32722": "Spend a lot of time in detention, do you?",
  "playermale_32726": "It’s my first time here.",
  "playermale_32727": "Thank you for this.",
  "playermale_32728": "I promise to tell you everything, but it’s perhaps best I do that later.",
  "playermale_32729": "It's my first time here.",
  "playermale_32730": "Thank you for this.",
  "playermale_32731": "I promise to tell you everything, but it's perhaps best that I do that later.",
  "playermale_32732": "[[I can try.]] I'll do my best. I can promise to speak with him about it.",
  "playermale_32733": "[[Sebastian's made up his mind.]] I'm afraid it's really up to Sebastian, and his mind seems to be made up.",
  "playermale_32739": "[[How do I collect materials?]] How should I collect magical materials?",
  "playermale_32758": "Archie? Archie Bickle?",
  "playermale_32773": "Sebastian – over here.",
  "playermale_32775": "Someone piled this here for a reason. Is it blocking something?",
  "playermale_32776": "Whose home was this?",
  "playermale_32779": "Hmm. It's a wonder the Ministry isn't doing more.",
  "playermale_32783": "You did not. Sounds worth looking into. Any idea where in the castle?",
  "playermale_32802": "I'm sorry you experienced something like that at so young an age.",
  "playermale_32803": "You must miss him.",
  "playermale_32804": "I wonder what Archie saw. I hope he didn't see Harlow kill his father.",
  "playermale_32807": "[[You can tell me.]] I'd like to know more about it, if you wouldn't mind telling me. I won't repeat it.",
  "playermale_32808": "[[You don't have to tell me.]] I understand. You needn't tell me if you don't want to.",
  "playermale_32832": "I wonder why.",
  "playermale_32834": "Hmm. Not everyone does.",
  "playermale_32836": "I don't know. I did see another memory. This time it was a Keeper named Niamh Fitzgerald.",
  "playermale_32840": "What were you thinking?",
  "playermale_32843": "[[He had no choice.]] How horrible. Poor Ominis. He was only a child. He shouldn't blame himself.",
  "playermale_32844": "[[He should have known better.]] That's awful. But, no matter the circumstance, he should never have cast it. He should have known better.",
  "playermale_32845": "[[The Dark Arts are dangerous.]] Ominis is right. Meddling in the Dark Arts is dangerous.",
  "playermale_32846": "[[I'm curious about the Dark Arts.]] The Dark Arts do pique my interest.",
  "playermale_32852": "[[I'm ready to go now.]] Of course. Shall we leave now?",
  "playermale_32854": "Thank you for humouring me.",
  "playermale_32855": "[[I am.]] I believe I am.",
  "playermale_32856": "[[Not quite.]] Just a few more minutes if that's all right.",
  "playermale_32857": "I can't believe any of what just happened.",
  "playermale_32858": "[[No. I'm ready to go.]] No. I think I'm ready to leave if you are.",
  "playermale_32859": "[[Yes, I'd like a few more minutes.]] Yes, just a few more minutes.",
  "playermale_32861": "Wait here. I'll run ahead.",
  "playermale_32863": "I'll draw her attention. Follow when it's safe.",
  "playermale_32870": "I am ready to do what's needed to take Harlow down. I know you have a plan.",
  "playermale_32875": "What was in the note?",
  "playermale_32876": "What did he ask you to do?",
  "playermale_32887": "[[That is what I needed.]] Thank you, Mrs Rabe. Knowing the lengths that Harlow will go to is helpful, albeit more than disturbing.",
  "playermale_32889": "[[Does the note confirm kidnapping?]] Are you sure the note means that your husband was kidnapped?",
  "playermale_32890": "[[Not at all. But I am ready to head back.]] Shall we head back? I'm ready if you are.",
  "playermale_32891": "[[I'm not ready to leave.]] I was hoping to look around for a moment, if you don't mind – take it all in.",
  "playermale_32895": "I hope Professor Fitzgerald has confirmed what she needed to. I have to complete the next trial as soon as I can.",
  "playermale_32897": "Hello, Professor. I have news. The goblins are looking for something. Another 'repository'. They've built drills to help with their search.",
  "playermale_32899": "I understand. Very well. I'll find some way to get in.",
  "playermale_32900": "How will I gain access to the Headmaster's office? Perhaps Professor Fig will know what to do.",
  "playermale_32901": "Professor Fig, the Keepers have shown me where the next trial is.",
  "playermale_32902": "Lodgok and I have learned that the goblins are searching for another repository – like the one we saw at Rookwood Castle.",
  "playermale_32903": "They encountered each other at Rookwood Castle. She was doing research. That's where she found the container with the Portkey.",
  "playermale_32904": "He liked her so much that he let her leave with it – despite orders from Ranrok.",
  "playermale_32906": "Wait, doesn't Polyjuice Potion require a bit of the person you want to change into? And take ages to brew?",
  "playermale_32907": "Incredible. I won't forget that taste any time soon.  How do I sound?",
  "playermale_32908": "I see. But what if Professor Black sees me?",
  "playermale_32909": "Thank you, Professor. I suppose we'll meet again in the Map Chamber.",
  "playermale_32911": "You could have got us killed.",
  "playermale_32916": "Wait! We should have some sort of plan.",
  "playermale_32917": "Did you hear that goblin?",
  "playermale_32919": "Sebastian – wait.",
  "playermale_32921": "These spiders are determined to make a meal of us.",
  "playermale_32926": "Can't we talk about this?",
  "playermale_32927": "How are you doing, Sebastian?",
  "playermale_32928": "I can be sneaky. Let's go.",
  "playermale_32945": "But, Professor –",
  "playermale_32946": "[[I need to ask you about a certain goblin.]] Hello, Miss Ryan. I wanted to thank you again for your help with Rookwood and Harlow the day of the troll attack.",
  "playermale_32947": "Miss Broom. A word.",
  "playermale_32953": "Pleasure to meet you.  Wait. Are you related to Professor Weasley?",
  "playermale_32954": "If you're sure.",
  "playermale_32955": "The Polyjuice Potion's wearing off. I'd best get out of sight. ",
  "playermale_32956": "Clopton, isn't it? Please, call me Phineas from now on. Consider it a special privilege.",
  "playermale_32957": "I wonder if all the elite wizarding families have a motto.",
  "playermale_32958": "The gargoyle. That's where I need to speak the password.",
  "playermale_32964": "It is, and I have.",
  "playermale_32965": "Oh, and as you've probably guessed by now, your Polyjuice plan worked like a charm.",
  "playermale_32966": "I should ask Sirona at the Three Broomsticks about the goblin she was talking to the day of the troll attack.",
  "playermale_32968": "[[I'm not sure that's a good idea.]] I don't know Garreth, I don't want to get on Sharp's bad side.",
  "playermale_32969": "[[I'm sorry. I can't.]] I've enough to worry about collecting the ingredients he wants me to get. I'm afraid I can't help you.",
  "playermale_32970": "Hmm. I don't believe I've met Mrs Sprottle.",
  "playermale_32971": "[[I don't know what you mean.]] I'm not sure what you're talking about, Professor.",
  "playermale_32972": "I'm glad I was able to meet your expectations.",
  "playermale_32976": "Are you all right?",
  "playermale_32978": "The book of poems that was taken from Agabus Philbert. He'll be thrilled to have this back.",
  "playermale_32979": "Otto Dibble's love letter from Rosie. He wanted me to destroy this if I found it.",
  "playermale_32980": "Natty must be here somewhere.",
  "playermale_32982": "Use mine. We'll find yours together once you're out of there.",
  "playermale_32983": "Understood. I'll find it.",
  "playermale_32985": "Impressive.",
  "playermale_32986": "What have the Keepers planned for me?",
  "playermale_32987": "These are never a welcome sight. At least I know what to expect this time.",
  "playermale_32988": "Hmm. Another memory. Now to find a way out of here.",
  "playermale_32992": "[[In the future, please call the authorities.]] I hope the next time Rookwood's lot comes calling, you'll alert the authorities.",
  "playermale_32993": "Actually, Officer Singer – Natty and I learned of several Hogsmeade residents who've had their lives threatened by the Ashwinders.",
  "playermale_32997": "[[How are you hiding the extortion?]] What have you been doing to keep the extortion a secret?",
  "playermale_32999": "[[Why would Harlow take your husband and not you?]] Why wouldn't Harlow extort your husband?",
  "playermale_33000": "[[Have you given Harlow any information about Gringotts?]] Have you helped Harlow since your husband was taken?",
  "playermale_33008": "Oh. Uh – yes. A friend of Professor Fig's.",
  "playermale_33009": "[[Not afraid of heights, are you?]] I take it you're not afraid of heights.",
  "playermale_33010": "I have everything. I see what you meant about not being able to pick a favourite shop.",
  "playermale_33015": "[[I'm not ready to tell you everything.]] The book I found in the Restricted Section was missing some pages. That's about it.",
  "playermale_33016": "All right. I can see traces of ancient magic.",
  "playermale_33019": "Pleasure to meet you, Cressida.",
  "playermale_33020": "[[Not at all.]] No. I merely studied with him briefly before we arrived.",
  "playermale_33021": "[[I've studied with him.]] I'm not sure I'd say that. But I did study with him a little before we arrived.",
  "playermale_33022": "Is that what you were trying to do just there?",
  "playermale_33023": "Professor Fig and I wound up there after the dragon attack. There was this Portkey –",
  "playermale_33024": "Well, it's all a bit convoluted –",
  "playermale_33025": "[[I don't want to impose.]] If your sister is unwell, she may not want visitors.",
  "playermale_33033": "Poor Sebastian. Not the visit he'd hoped for.",
  "playermale_33034": "I ought to see how Sebastian's faring.",
  "playermale_33036": "I seem to be collecting bits of stone when I vanish these objects.",
  "playermale_33037": "Sebastian –",
  "playermale_33052": "Of course. Ominis spoke to me about his family when we first met. To say that he has 'no love lost' for them is an understatement.",
  "playermale_33053": "Understood. But, why does Ominis have 'no love lost' for his family?",
  "playermale_33055": "He and Ranrok were close once, but they had a falling out.",
  "playermale_33056": "Lodgok did mention that Ranrok is searching for something, but he couldn't say what.",
  "playermale_33062": "Very well, sir. I'm on my way.",
  "playermale_33069": "It looks empty. If they've taken all of it, why are they still here?",
  "playermale_33070": "Professor Rookwood, the goblins and Dark wizards who've overrun your castle are digging for 'stores of magic' –",
  "playermale_33073": "Hello, Grace. What are you doing here?",
  "playermale_33074": "I suppose so!",
  "playermale_33075": "Fig and I think that Ranrok has somehow found a way to harness that magic's power.",
  "playermale_33076": "There. Can hardly tell a troll barrelled through it.",
  "playermale_33083": "I have a rare ability to see whispers of ancient magic.",
  "playermale_33084": "I'm not entirely sure, but the Keepers have said that it's a powerful magic that should only be wielded by a select few.",
  "playermale_33096": "Very well, Professor.",
  "playermale_33102": "I've actually met Mrs Sprottle. I recently spoke with her about her friend Claire Beaumont.",
  "playermale_33103": "[[I spoke with him.]] I did, thank you. We had a good conversation. He sends you his best.",
  "playermale_33104": "Mr Rabe? Daisy told me you'd been abducted.",
  "playermale_33105": "Worried about you. Are you all right?",
  "playermale_33106": "Why hide a triptych here?",
  "playermale_33107": "A note – let's have a look.",
  "playermale_33108": "[[You're not thinking straight.]] You don't know what you're saying. Take a breath for a moment.",
  "playermale_33110": "Hello, Lucan. I'd like to practise with the training dummy.",
  "playermale_33111": "[[Yes.]] That'd be brilliant.",
  "playermale_33112": "[[Perhaps later.]] Actually, I might come back later.",
  "playermale_33113": "Hello, Lucan. I'm ready for practice.",
  "playermale_33114": "[[Couldn't have done it without you.]] Thanks, Lucan. You've been a great help.",
  "playermale_33115": "[[It was just a dummy.]] It was only a training dummy.",
  "playermale_33116": "Nice to see you again Mrs Sprottle. Actually, Sirona Ryan asked if I'd come and see you.",
  "playermale_33119": "[[I am.]] <i>Crucio</i>, correct? The Cruciatus Curse – also known as the Torture Curse. Inflicts excruciating pain on the victim.",
  "playermale_33120": "[[I'm not.]] What does the Cruciatus Curse do?",
  "playermale_33136": "Now to find the Headmaster's house-elf.",
  "playermale_33138": "Perhaps I'll have to purchase a broom then.",
  "playermale_33142": "Hello, I don't believe we've met.",
  "playermale_33143": "[[What happened to Sebastian's parents?]] I knew his parents died, but I never heard what happened.",
  "playermale_33144": "[[Such a tragic loss.]] Poor Anne and Sebastian.",
  "playermale_33149": "You'd like me to report back with even more flight details?",
  "playermale_33150": "Hello, Mr Weekes. Did you still need help with your broom upgrades?",
  "playermale_33151": "Hello again, Mr Weekes. I set a new record at the south course!",
  "playermale_33152": "Very well. I shall let you know when I have some.",
  "playermale_33153": "[[Can any beast produce materials?]] Will all of my beasts produce magical materials?",
  "playermale_33156": "[[The spellbook is concerning.]] Some references Sebastian mentioned in the book do worry me.",
  "playermale_33165": "[[Are you a painter?]] You mentioned that your paintings were taken. Are you a painter?",
  "playermale_33167": "[[Happy to be rid of it.]] Of course. Glad to hand it over, frankly.",
  "playermale_33168": "[[I'd like to be paid.]] It wasn't as easy to come by as I had expected. I'd like to be paid for my troubles.",
  "playermale_33170": "[[If it helps me, I suppose I could check on Tobbs.]] Well, I suppose if looking for Tobbs also allows me to test my enchanted clothing, then I can do it.",
  "playermale_33175": "Should be, Professor?",
  "playermale_33177": "I won't, Professor. Thank you.",
  "playermale_33178": "Mr Barnes will only get in trouble going down this path. I need to find another way to get him a Venomous Tentacula.",
  "playermale_33180": "Now I can conjure a breeding pen in the Room. Best get back to Deek with the Thestrals.",
  "playermale_33181": "Who is this wizard?",
  "playermale_33182": "Who are you? Why are we here?",
  "playermale_33183": "Opening all of these is tempting.",
  "playermale_33184": "We're in a tomb. I assume eerie sounds come with the territory.",
  "playermale_33185": "Hmm. Leave no stone unturned. Or in this case, no bone.",
  "playermale_33195": "[[How do you know the Imperius Curse?]] Where did you learn the Imperius Curse?",
  "playermale_33197": "[[I'd prefer not to learn the Imperius Curse.]] I don't think learning the Imperius Curse is a good idea.",
  "playermale_33198": "[[Yes, I'd like to learn the Imperius Curse.]] It's probably wise to know the spell.",
  "playermale_33199": "[[What does learning the Curse entail?]] Shouldn't I know more about what the Curse entails?",
  "playermale_33200": "What's happening?",
  "playermale_33202": "I need to get the reflections to follow the light.",
  "playermale_33203": "Perhaps I need to get them all to stand at once.",
  "playermale_33204": "Where do I need to be to get all of them to stand at once?",
  "playermale_33205": "Where am I supposed to go?",
  "playermale_33207": "Ah, here we are.",
  "playermale_33208": "Incredible.",
  "playermale_33209": "Hello there. Was there something you needed?",
  "playermale_33210": "[[What are magical materials for?]] What uses do magical materials have?",
  "playermale_33211": "[[How frustrating for you.]] That must have been frustrating for you.",
  "playermale_33212": "[[I can see why.]] I can see why he said that. You do seem angry.",
  "playermale_33213": "Yeah, spiders aren't insects.",
  "playermale_33215": "What did you hope would happen?",
  "playermale_33217": "I shall do my best. Any idea where it might be?",
  "playermale_33223": "Is Mr Rabe all right?",
  "playermale_33225": "[[Understood.]] Yes, Officer. Do you have enough evidence to take down Harlow and the rest of Rookwood's lot?",
  "playermale_33228": "There's something here by the altar.",
  "playermale_33229": "Looks like part of a student's diary. It mentions plans to return for the relic and conjuring barricades using bones.",
  "playermale_33235": "[[Let's explore the catacomb.]] I'm ready to explore the catacomb. Perhaps we can visit Anne when we've finished.",
  "playermale_33236": "And then – were abandoned?",
  "playermale_33245": "[[I am a bit curious.]] It's not that I'm not interested. And you can certainly trust me if you want to tell me anything.",
  "playermale_33246": "[[I actually should be going.]] If you learn more about that scriptorium, let me know.",
  "playermale_33249": "I know, I know. Continue to hone my magic.",
  "playermale_33251": "[[Sounds a bit dangerous.]] Might be a bit dangerous for a broom trial. I'll see what I can do.",
  "playermale_33253": "The best upgrade yet. It flew beautifully. Incredibly nimble.",
  "playermale_33256": "I should let Mr Weekes know that this was his best upgrade yet.",
  "playermale_33257": "That's odd. Why would someone store one hat in here?",
  "playermale_33258": "I don't know the Headmaster's house-elf. Will he even speak to me? I imagine he's loyal to the Headmaster.",
  "playermale_33259": "I'm just here for Summoner's Court.",
  "playermale_33260": "Bit dramatic, isn't it?",
  "playermale_33261": "How gracious of you.",
  "playermale_33265": "I doubt anyone's been here in quite some time.",
  "playermale_33266": "For a moment there, I thought that'd never end.",
  "playermale_33267": "Hold on. Don't give up yet.",
  "playermale_33270": "[[We should leave the relic alone.]] The note advises to leave the relic alone.",
  "playermale_33274": "Sophronia, could you remind what it was you needed help with?",
  "playermale_33276": "What do you suppose is meant by 'the Dark sacrifice required to realise the relic's potential'?",
  "playermale_33277": "[[We need that relic.]] I'm willing to ignore what the journal entry says. We're taking the relic.",
  "playermale_33279": "Hold on, both of you. Sebastian, please, take a step back.",
  "playermale_33280": "[[Something tells me you want to find this creature.]] I take it you aren't going to let the poachers anywhere near the Snidgets.",
  "playermale_33282": "[[I cannot side with you. Sebastian's right.]] Sebastian's right. We need that relic.",
  "playermale_33283": "[[Very well. Let's talk with Sebastian.]] You're right. This seems far riskier than Sebastian realises.",
  "playermale_33285": "He did, Professor.",
  "playermale_33286": "It does mention something else – it says their next assignment was learning the Imperius Curse.",
  "playermale_33292": "What exactly happened to your father?",
  "playermale_33293": "'Galloping'? Your father was also an Animagus, I take it?",
  "playermale_33294": "[[I'm so sorry, Natty.]] I'm sorry, Natty. I can't imagine what you've been through. Your father sounds exceptional.",
  "playermale_33295": "Yes, I remember. 'Rain does not fall on one roof alone.'",
  "playermale_33296": "[[Are you looking to avenge his death?]] Do you think taking down the Ashwinders will avenge your father's death?",
  "playermale_33297": "[[What would your father think of what we've been doing?]] Do you think your father would approve of the things we've been doing?",
  "playermale_33298": "I do think we should talk to him, but I fear we won't stop him from taking the relic.",
  "playermale_33299": "We allow Sebastian to leave with the relic under one condition: after this, no more.",
  "playermale_33300": "You're not, Ominis. This may be the only way to keep your friendship intact. Let's trust him to know what's best.",
  "playermale_33303": "Are you willing to sacrifice your friendship over this?",
  "playermale_33304": "[[Yes. That is precisely what I'm suggesting.]] That's what I'm saying. I would take all responsibility. This could save your friendship.",
  "playermale_33306": "[[Yes. That's precisely what I'm suggesting.]] That's what I'm saying. I would take all responsibility. This could save your friendship.",
  "playermale_33307": "What did you need me to do, Deek?",
  "playermale_33314": "Sebastian, we need to go.",
  "playermale_33315": "Sebastian – come on.",
  "playermale_33318": "[[I'm looking forward to my first day.]] I'm glad to be here. Ready for classes to start.",
  "playermale_33319": "[[I'm actually a tad nervous.]] Harrowing indeed. I'm still a bit on edge myself and a little nervous for classes to start.",
  "playermale_33320": "Wait – did you say 'most' professors are firm but fair?",
  "playermale_33321": "You too, Everett.",
  "playermale_33324": "I take it we can call that a success?",
  "playermale_33326": "No wonder Sophronia wanted to see this.",
  "playermale_33329": "Glad to hear it.",
  "playermale_33330": "[[Good game.]] Let's let bygones be bygones, shall we? You played a good game.",
  "playermale_33332": "[[It was terrifying.]] Professor Fig and I were lucky to escape with our lives.",
  "playermale_33333": "[[It was exciting.]] It was dreadful, certainly, but quite an experience nonetheless.",
  "playermale_33334": "It's all still a bit of a blur, to be honest.",
  "playermale_33338": "Actually, Professor Fig told me about Wiggenweld Potion.",
  "playermale_33339": "[[He's quite knowledgeable.]] Professor Fig does know a great deal about, uh, different forms of magic.",
  "playermale_33340": "[[I wouldn't really know.]] He did teach me a few things before term, but that's all I can tell you.",
  "playermale_33341": "[[Nice talking with you.]] It was nice to meet you, Samantha. Good luck with your dittany.",
  "playermale_33342": "[[Do most students grow their own ingredients?]] Is it common practice for students to grow their own ingredients?",
  "playermale_33345": "[[What was your business with Alfred Lawley?]] You said Mr Lawley was your ex-business partner. What were you working on?",
  "playermale_33346": "[[Why this Venomous Tentacula?]] Why do you need Mr Lawley's Venomous Tentacula in particular?",
  "playermale_33347": "[[What else is in the cellar?]] What else is in Mr Lawley's cellar?",
  "playermale_33364": "It might be best to let him calm down a while. May I speak to him? Perhaps I can help to ease the tension a bit.",
  "playermale_33366": "[[Natsai Onai.]] Yes, Natty.",
  "playermale_33367": "[[Sebastian Sallow.]] Yes, Sebastian.",
  "playermale_33368": "[[No.]] I'll be duelling solo.",
  "playermale_33373": "[[Natsai Onai.]] Yes: Natty.",
  "playermale_33375": "[[Sebastian Sallow.]] Yes: Sebastian.",
  "playermale_33376": "[[No.]] I'll go it alone.",
  "playermale_33377": "Where might this lead?",
  "playermale_33378": "Ah. I need to 'wake up' that rune over there.",
  "playermale_33379": "Not surprising. Guards at the ready.",
  "playermale_33380": "This must be the way forward – but to where?",
  "playermale_33381": "Nearly there. Best to keep my wits about me.",
  "playermale_33382": "Looks like another Pensieve up ahead. And that appears to be a giant statue of Professor Rackham.",
  "playermale_33384": "You can see Thestrals too?",
  "playermale_33392": "Ominis has. Let's go.",
  "playermale_33393": "I'll explain on the way. Come on.",
  "playermale_33398": "I'm sorry we can both see Thestrals.",
  "playermale_33399": "I hope Professor Fig got my owl. I need to tell him and the Keepers that Ranrok knows where the last repository is.",
  "playermale_33400": "Professor! You received my owl. Ranrok has the last of Bragbor's journals. He killed Lodgok to get it. He knows where the last repository is.",
  "playermale_33405": "Very well.",
  "playermale_33406": "Thank you, Professor Bakar. I shall see you back in the Map Chamber.",
  "playermale_33407": "This must be the last artefact. I still have no idea what these are meant for.",
  "playermale_33408": "Now to return to the Map Chamber, and not a moment too soon.",
  "playermale_33409": "The caverns below Hogwarts – where you fought Isidora. Is that the location of the final repository?",
  "playermale_33411": "All right, professor. I'll see you soon.",
  "playermale_33423": "[[How did you steal from Peeves?]] How is it possible to steal from Peeves – a Poltergeist?",
  "playermale_33424": "What map?",
  "playermale_33425": "[[How did you steal from Peeves?]] How is it possible to steal from Peeves – a Poltergeist?",
  "playermale_33426": "[[How did you steal from Peeves?]] How is it possible to steal from Peeves – a poltergeist?",
  "playermale_33431": "[[Any tips for rescuing elusive beasts?]] Do you have any advice on how I can rescue more elusive beasts?",
  "playermale_33432": "[[What was it like working for a poacher?]] Would you mind talking a bit more about what it was like working for your former master?",
  "playermale_33434": "[[How did you come to be at Hogwarts?]] How did you end up at Hogwarts after working for your former master?",
  "playermale_33435": "Ominis, I learned <i>Imperio</i>. I want you to know –",
  "playermale_33436": "We've made it this far – but clearly we have more to do.",
  "playermale_33440": "An 'Enchanted Loom?'",
  "playermale_33442": "Happy to be here. It is good to leave the classroom now and then.",
  "playermale_33443": "I am too. You were speaking to a goblin here that day.",
  "playermale_33444": "[[I'm glad to hear it.]] It seemed as though you were on good terms with him.",
  "playermale_33445": "[[How can you trust a goblin?]] I was surprised that you seemed friendly with a goblin.",
  "playermale_33446": "In that case, I'd like to talk with him – about Ranrok in particular. Where might I find him?",
  "playermale_33447": "[[Thank you.]] Thank you, Sirona.",
  "playermale_33452": "Just before we came to Hogwarts. In fact, it's why I was late to the Sorting Ceremony.",
  "playermale_33453": "A Portkey brought us there after the dragon attacked our carriage.",
  "playermale_33454": "There's one more thing. It's a bit odd, if I'm honest.",
  "playermale_33459": "Thank you, Natty.",
  "playermale_33460": "No. Actually, I wanted to speak with you. It's about Ranrok.",
  "playermale_33461": "I am. And I need to know what he and his Loyalists are up to – so I can stay a step ahead.",
  "playermale_33462": "Hello, Lucan. I'm ready for practice.",
  "playermale_33463": "I'm afraid he wants you nowhere near Feldcroft – nor Anne.",
  "playermale_33467": "[[Sirona trusts me.]] Sirona trusts me and she thought our interests may be aligned.",
  "playermale_33468": "[[Perhaps I misjudged you.]] Sirona said our interests may be aligned. Perhaps she was wrong.",
  "playermale_33474": "Be careful, Sebastian. Your uncle could intercept it. We'll be expelled.",
  "playermale_33478": "[[Very well. Let me know what you find.]] I shall wait to hear from you, then.",
  "playermale_33483": "One nudge and that chest might've fallen.",
  "playermale_33484": "A staircase leading here? Whatever for?",
  "playermale_33485": "Getting through the cavern can't have been the only challenge. Perhaps we should search for runes.",
  "playermale_33486": "A journal entry. Isidora was here.",
  "playermale_33488": "More than one.",
  "playermale_33489": "This journal entry sounds worrisome.",
  "playermale_33491": "Professor Shah, I'm interested in learning more about Astronomy.",
  "playermale_33492": "Thank you.",
  "playermale_33493": "That's quite generous. Thank you.",
  "playermale_33494": "I'm listening.",
  "playermale_33495": "What precisely is the relic I'm to retrieve?",
  "playermale_33496": "Wizardkind sees things differently. It's a wonder goblins and wizards have ever been able to work together.",
  "playermale_33497": "They seem to be.",
  "playermale_33498": "I do have some questions about Ranrok and the helmet.",
  "playermale_33502": "[[Very well. I'll go.]] I'll head there now.",
  "playermale_33503": "[[Perhaps I should get help.]] An entire camp of Rookwood's thieves? I might need assistance.",
  "playermale_33504": "This place can't have belonged to only Isidora.",
  "playermale_33506": "Another ancient magic passageway to the Undercroft – the final piece to the triptych must be here.",
  "playermale_33508": "I know from the memories I've seen that the Keepers and Isidora didn't see eye to eye on the use of ancient magic.",
  "playermale_33509": "Isidora must have honed her skill with ancient magic here.",
  "playermale_33511": "This is it.",
  "playermale_33513": "[[Yes you should have.]] Perhaps you should have.",
  "playermale_33520": "Hello, Garreth. So, has your aunt been taking it a bit easier on you lately?",
  "playermale_33528": "I remember Amit mentioning something about Gobbledegook.",
  "playermale_33529": "Hello, Amit. Do I recall you saying that you speak Gobbledegook?",
  "playermale_33530": "It is. His name is Lodgok. We could use your help with something.",
  "playermale_33531": "He's waiting for me near a goblin mine. Would you be willing to help?",
  "playermale_33532": "Here comes my friend Amit. Probably best to continue our conversation later.",
  "playermale_33533": "Bragbor?",
  "playermale_33534": "Why does Ranrok care so much about these repositories?",
  "playermale_33535": "What do you mean, ‘repositories?’",
  "playermale_33536": "Rookwood Castle.",
  "playermale_33537": "Hello, Samantha. Nice to see you again.",
  "playermale_33538": "Hello. You wanted to speak to me?",
  "playermale_33539": "[[Wasn't too challenging a lesson.]] Thank you, but it really wasn't all that challenging.",
  "playermale_33540": "[[What are your reasons for going after Rookwood and Harlow?]] You seem to be very determined in stopping Rookwood and Harlow. Why?",
  "playermale_33541": "[[Thank you.]] That's all I wanted to know.",
  "playermale_33542": "[[Can't we just go straight to the Ministry?]] Can't we just bypass Singer and go directly to the Ministry?",
  "playermale_33543": "[[Let's head to the mine, then.]] Lodgok is waiting. Shall we go?",
  "playermale_33544": "[[How well do you know Gobbledegook?]] You said you know Gobbledegook, but how well?",
  "playermale_33545": "[[Have you never met a goblin?]] Have you ever spoken directly to a goblin?",
  "playermale_33546": "Thank you for being willing to help me, Amit.",
  "playermale_33547": "A friend who speaks Gobbledegook is meeting us. Before he arrives, perhaps you could tell me why we're here.",
  "playermale_33548": "I'll go and experiment with the Loom now.",
  "playermale_33549": "What did you ask me to do with my magical materials?",
  "playermale_33558": "Yes, of course. Good to see you again.",
  "playermale_33566": "I've been wondering about something else you said before we entered the mine.",
  "playermale_33568": "A phoenix nest? I wonder if it belongs to the phoenix Natty mentioned; the one Harlow and the Poacher Pack are after.",
  "playermale_33569": "Hello. Do you have a moment?",
  "playermale_33570": "Hello again, Miss Wolff.",
  "playermale_33571": "Hello, Mr Ollivander. I wondered if you might be able to help me with something.",
  "playermale_33573": "Yes, sir. I have them here.",
  "playermale_33587": "[[Hasn't Professor Fig said anything?]] Have you and Professor Fig not discussed my training?",
  "playermale_33588": "[[No, Professor.]] Nothing more, Professor.",
  "playermale_33589": "What written plans? And why can't you come with us?",
  "playermale_33590": "Glad to hear it.",
  "playermale_33600": "I've met some interesting students in Hufflepuff. Hard-working lot, I gather.",
  "playermale_33601": "You're a Hufflepuff too? Always nice to see our house represented well.",
  "playermale_33602": "What did you discover in the spellbook we found in the scriptorium?",
  "playermale_33603": "Hello, Nellie. You seem excited about something.",
  "playermale_33604": "[[I'll look into it.]] Perhaps I'll give it a go.",
  "playermale_33606": "The what keys?",
  "playermale_33607": "Why would I do that?",
  "playermale_33608": "[[Why would a headmistress do such a thing?]] Why would Professor Mole conjure flying keys?",
  "playermale_33610": "Is everything all right?",
  "playermale_33611": "[[Why don't you follow the keys?]] Surely you will be trying to complete the challenge as well?",
  "playermale_33612": "Could you remind me how the Daedalian Keys work again?",
  "playermale_33613": "What am I to do, Professor Fitzgerald?",
  "playermale_33621": "[[This is more complicated than we thought.]] So we have to get Anne to the catacomb and then conduct a sacrifice? Seems – risky.",
  "playermale_33622": "[[We can do this.]] We just need to get Anne to the catacomb and work out how to make a Dark sacrifice.",
  "playermale_33625": "And we have to keep all of this from your uncle. If he goes to the Headmaster, we could be expelled.",
  "playermale_33626": "[[Might your uncle report us to the Ministry?]] Do you think your uncle would tell anyone at the Ministry about all of this if he found out?",
  "playermale_33630": "Hello, sir. What do you sell here?",
  "playermale_33635": "Hello again, Imelda. Is your challenge still on the table?",
  "playermale_33636": "Sounds like you're speaking from experience.",
  "playermale_33639": "[[I can't take your telescope.]] I can't do that, Amit. You might need it.",
  "playermale_33640": "Amit, you'll need to stay close to me. I've dealt with worse enemies than these.",
  "playermale_33641": "Keep your wits about you, Amit. I'll get you through this mine.",
  "playermale_33642": "We need to be careful. As I'm sure you know, not all goblins are as friendly as Lodgok – to say the least.",
  "playermale_33646": "Don't think I've found all the plans. I'd best keep looking.",
  "playermale_33647": "Let's get out of here and tell Lodgok what we've found.",
  "playermale_33648": "Surely my win means something.",
  "playermale_33657": "Ominis, I –",
  "playermale_33658": "[[I know. This is my fault.]] It's my fault. I was wrong. I thought he'd stop.",
  "playermale_33659": "[[I regret what I did.]] You were right. I do regret casting <i>Imperio</i>. I hope you can forgive me.",
  "playermale_33660": "I received your owl. Where's Sebastian?",
  "playermale_33662": "[[I did what I had to do.]] You did agree. And it did save your friendship with Sebastian.",
  "playermale_33663": "[[Sebastian won't listen.]] He won't listen to reason.",
  "playermale_33664": "Last time we were here, this place was crawling with spiders.",
  "playermale_33665": "Where was Sebastian when you and Anne found him?",
  "playermale_33666": "And there's no sign of Sebastian.",
  "playermale_33671": "Solomon threatened to go to the Headmaster if he heard of Sebastian dealing with Dark Magic.",
  "playermale_33674": "The carvings on the relic – were Inferi? And Sebastian somehow created them?",
  "playermale_33682": "I've actually met Scrope, but I'm not sure he'll tell me. He's rather devoted to the Black family.",
  "playermale_33683": "I shall. I wonder where I should conjure their pen?",
  "playermale_33684": "Remind me of your area of affinity, Broom. O.W.L.s are swift approaching.",
  "playermale_33685": "Keep at it, Broom, and before you know it you'll be as invisible as that new fifth-year seems to be.",
  "playermale_33686": "Hmph. Speaking of invisible – where's my blasted house-elf?",
  "playermale_33687": "[[I will decide what's best.]] I assure you, Sharp. You may speak freely.",
  "playermale_33688": "Ah! (cough) Of course. Yes. No need for all the cloak and dagger. Simply have a student deliver it.",
  "playermale_33689": "But – the injury, Madam Kogawa.",
  "playermale_33690": "Made it just in time. It's wearing off. ",
  "playermale_33691": "This isn't what it looks like. I can explain. ",
  "playermale_33692": "Fig was right. I can't believe it worked. Now to speak the password to the gargoyle.",
  "playermale_33693": "That must be the pedestal.",
  "playermale_33694": "[[Very well.]] I suspect there will be more to this than reading a book.",
  "playermale_33696": "[[What will I find in the book?]] What can I expect to find in the book?",
  "playermale_33698": "A simple stone. This must be for me.",
  "playermale_33699": "Sebastian – ",
  "playermale_33703": "[[Everyone should know that curse.]] He did attack us. You had no choice.",
  "playermale_33704": "[[No one should know that curse.]] You went too far, Sebastian.",
  "playermale_33705": "Sebastian – wait.",
  "playermale_33706": "Stop, Sebastian. Hold on.",
  "playermale_33712": "[[She seemed genuinely worried.]] She mentioned Dark Magic and even the Ashwinders.",
  "playermale_33713": "[[She seemed to be overreacting.]] She mentioned Dark Magic and the Ashwinders. Has her imagination got the best of her?",
  "playermale_33714": "Sebastian – over here.",
  "playermale_33715": "I said I'm taking responsibility, Sebastian. Do you want the relic or not?",
  "playermale_33716": "I should see this through and find the Hufflepuff house chest.",
  "playermale_33717": "I should see this through and find the Ravenclaw house chest.",
  "playermale_33718": "I should see this through and find the Slytherin house chest.",
  "playermale_33719": "Silvanus Selwyn?",
  "playermale_33720": "Victor Rookwood is dead. He confronted me as I left Ollivanders with the Keepers' wand. I had to defend myself.",
  "playermale_33721": "I should hope that the enchantments protecting the castle would protect against an incursion from below.",
  "playermale_33722": "I should imagine so.",
  "playermale_33724": "Were you able to reach Professor Weasley?",
  "playermale_33725": "I wonder if Ranrok is here.",
  "playermale_33726": "You and I have faced worse, Professor.",
  "playermale_33728": "You will not take what is not yours!",
  "playermale_33729": "This drill stands between us and him. We need to move it.",
  "playermale_33730": "That sounds like trouble.",
  "playermale_33732": "You're no match for us.",
  "playermale_33733": "Another troll! Where are the other professors?",
  "playermale_33734": "Professor! That wall – that's the way forward!",
  "playermale_33735": "I fear you're right, Professor. There's nothing we can do but keep searching.",
  "playermale_33736": "What could be taking the other professors so long to get here?",
  "playermale_33737": "I hope you're right.",
  "playermale_33738": "We can use those against them.",
  "playermale_33739": "You'll never find what Ranrok wants.",
  "playermale_33740": "We'll show these beasts who's in charge.",
  "playermale_33741": "Look out. Another troll. This one's worse than the last two.",
  "playermale_33742": "We made it.",
  "playermale_33743": "I can't believe this is it. The repository has been under the castle for hundreds of years.",
  "playermale_33744": "Your timing couldn't be better, Professor Hecat.",
  "playermale_33745": "We couldn't be happier to see you, Professor Sharp.",
  "playermale_33748": "Let's see how you like it.",
  "playermale_33749": "Two can play at this game.",
  "playermale_33750": "How about a taste of your own power?",
  "playermale_33751": "Where did those come from?",
  "playermale_33752": "You won't get away from me that easily.",
  "playermale_33753": "You can't stop me.",
  "playermale_33755": "Ranrok, if you can hear me, your end is coming.",
  "playermale_33757": "How long are you going to keep up this charade?",
  "playermale_33758": "I need to avoid those.",
  "playermale_33759": "You can't run forever, Ranrok.",
  "playermale_33761": "You can't stop me, dragon.",
  "playermale_33762": "Ha! Don't like that very much, do you?",
  "playermale_33763": "I have you on the run, but you can't escape.",
  "playermale_33764": "This ends here, Ranrok!",
  "playermale_33765": "It's tearing this place apart.",
  "playermale_33766": "I need to steal its magic.",
  "playermale_33767": "Almost there.",
  "playermale_33769": "Why do you think you'll find a cure in the Restricted Section? Does the Hogwarts matron have nothing that can help Anne?",
  "playermale_33780": "I can.",
  "playermale_33785": "Will I be able to weave even more powerful magic into my clothing with the loom?",
  "playermale_33786": "The white one! It's her.",
  "playermale_33787": "Ah-ha! Found you.",
  "playermale_33788": "Bones outside a sarcophagus. Seems – odd.",
  "playermale_33789": "What do I need to do, Deek?",
  "playermale_33796": "Sebastian, we need to go.",
  "playermale_33797": "Sebastian – a journal entry! We should look for more.",
  "playermale_33801": "Sebastian –",
  "playermale_33802": "Ominis – ",
  "playermale_33818": "[[We should turn Sebastian in.]] We don't have a choice. You're right. You were right the entire time.",
  "playermale_33819": "[[We must not turn Sebastian in.]] We do have a choice. What good will it do to turn him in now?",
  "playermale_33828": "Understood.",
  "playermale_33849": "It is.",
  "playermale_33851": "[[What have you heard about Ranrok and Rookwood?]] Have you heard what Ranrok and Rookwood are working on together?",
  "playermale_33852": "[[Are you worried about Rookwood?]] You seemed unfazed by Rookwood and Harlow the other day. They don't scare you?",
  "playermale_33853": "But you're friends now?",
  "playermale_33854": "Might I ask you some questions, Sirona?",
  "playermale_33857": "Surely this changes things. Ranrok has Bragbor's journals and knows where the final repository is.",
  "playermale_33858": "Poachers! Garnuff was right, then. I'd better be careful.",
  "playermale_33863": "I retrieved a stolen helm that he hopes to return to Ranrok in order to regain his confidence.",
  "playermale_33864": "Another Pensieve.",
  "playermale_33865": "I wonder –",
  "playermale_33866": "Let's find out.",
  "playermale_33869": "[[It was terrifying for both of us.]] If it weren't for me, I suspect those poachers would have flayed her alive.",
  "playermale_33870": "[[We are both fine.]] Biscuit is fine, as am I. I was able to rescue her without much incident.",
  "playermale_33871": "[[I'm sure she'll be glad to be home.]] I'm glad she's safe now. I'm sure she'll be happy to go home.",
  "playermale_33872": "[[I'd like to be compensated for my efforts.]] You can have her back – for the right price.",
  "playermale_33873": "That's it for the poachers. Now to find Biscuit.",
  "playermale_33874": "All right, Biscuit. Let's get you back to Garnuff, shall we?",
  "playermale_33875": "She's all right. She said she was going to rest.",
  "playermale_33876": "This is my chance. I'm coming, Niamh.",
  "playermale_33877": "I'd best move while I can. Niamh must be here somewhere.",
  "playermale_33878": "I see. A staircase straight ahead.",
  "playermale_33879": "Death.",
  "playermale_33880": "A ladder. Perhaps they won't be able to find me if I go up there.",
  "playermale_33881": "Too many. I must cross this road as fast as I can.",
  "playermale_33882": "That doorway looks like the only safe way forward.",
  "playermale_33883": "Nothing this way but more danger. There must be another way to find you.",
  "playermale_33887": "I've seen Thestrals before, but where would I find a pair of them nearby?",
  "playermale_33888": "Perhaps that helm will yield some answers.",
  "playermale_33890": "This may have been a bad idea.",
  "playermale_33891": "<i>Incendio!</i>",
  "playermale_33892": "This way!",
  "playermale_33893": "I'm guessing the egg we have belongs to that dragon –",
  "playermale_33894": "Miss Willardsey, could you remind me what it is that you needed?",
  "playermale_33895": "Rookwood Castle?",
  "playermale_33899": "Let's get into that castle.",
  "playermale_33901": "– and have broken open some sort of container.",
  "playermale_33902": "[[I'm ready.]] Just tell me where I need to go.",
  "playermale_33903": "[[I deserve to know more first.]] Sir, surely I've proven myself. In light of what's happened, perhaps you should tell me everything now.",
  "playermale_33917": "Sebastian –",
  "playermale_33918": "Sebastian – we're ready.",
  "playermale_33919": "Ominis and I found a compromise.",
  "playermale_33920": "I told him we ought to give you this chance – that the relic is too important to ignore.",
  "playermale_33921": "You need the relic.",
  "playermale_33922": "Ominis and I agreed. Surely there's a difference between casting <i>Imperio</i> on someone without their knowledge and casting it with permission.",
  "playermale_33923": "I've taken full responsibility. You have my word.",
  "playermale_33924": "The curse is lifted already. He'll easily find his way out of the catacomb, just as we did.",
  "playermale_33925": "He was troubled, Sebastian. Even though we agreed to it all, it's been a lot to take in.",
  "playermale_33926": "Very well. Let me know when and I'll meet you.",
  "playermale_33927": "Why is it off limits?",
  "playermale_33928": "Hence the name.",
  "playermale_33929": "Nothing gets past you.",
  "playermale_33930": "He'll be all right, Sebastian.",
  "playermale_33931": "And yes. It is. As I'm sure you suspect, there is a bit more to all of this.",
  "playermale_33933": "And, sir – there's something else. Lodgok knew Miriam.",
  "playermale_33934": "I – I don't know.",
  "playermale_33935": "Why did the Keepers want to keep Isidora quiet? Why destroy her portrait?",
  "playermale_33941": "I – certainly hope that's a good thing.",
  "playermale_33942": "I couldn't stand there and watch them harm the poor thing.",
  "playermale_33955": "[[No need for threats.]] You needn't threaten me. I'm not going to say anything about your 'Undercroft.'",
  "playermale_33956": "[[No need for threats.]] You needn't threaten me. I'm not going to say anything about your 'Undercroft.'",
  "playermale_33957": "Please! I was trying to defend him. He was clear that this was a secret place and I was to tell no one. He's a good friend.",
  "playermale_33958": "And Sebastian is a good friend. You shouldn't immediately assume the worst of him.",
  "playermale_33959": "Ominis, I just meant –",
  "playermale_33960": "[[I promise not to say anything.]] Trust me, Ominis. I won't say a word.",
  "playermale_33961": "[[I promise not to say anything.]] Trust me, Ominis. I won't say a word.",
  "playermale_33962": "[[She was brilliant!]] I thought she was brilliant. Can't believe you introduced me to her.",
  "playermale_33963": "Professor Howin mentioned the poachers as well. She seemed to imply that we couldn't rely on the Ministry to help.",
  "playermale_33964": "[[That hardly sounds incriminating.]] You may be reading into it. Talking to people isn't a crime.",
  "playermale_33965": "[[That sounds suspicious.]] That does seem strange. Sounds as if they're planning something.",
  "playermale_33966": "How exactly did you and Highwing cross paths?",
  "playermale_33968": "Surely the poachers can be brought to justice by someone – the Ministry, perhaps.",
  "playermale_33969": "[[I wouldn't. Poachers are dangerous.]] I'm not sure that's such a good idea. The poachers seem a dangerous lot.",
  "playermale_33970": "[[Would be good to investigate.]] I think that's a fine idea. Information is power.",
  "playermale_33971": "You seem undeterred. Will you let me know what you find out?",
  "playermale_33972": "Considering the bones, I'll assume this is a tomb.",
  "playermale_33975": "I did. And because Jackdaw had followed the map they contained, when I found the pages, I found the location on the map.",
  "playermale_33976": "Believe it or not, it's a room below Hogwarts.",
  "playermale_33977": "I was hoping you'd say that. Oh, and we'll need to bring the book.",
  "playermale_33978": "I have, Professor – Rookwood.",
  "playermale_33983": "Before the witch from the last Pensieve – Isidora – became a Hogwarts professor, she argued with Professor Rackham about using magic to remove pain.",
  "playermale_33984": "And this is my mentor, Professor Fig.",
  "playermale_33985": "Let's go.",
  "playermale_33986": "I don't think so.",
  "playermale_33987": "Ranrok is working with Rookwood?",
  "playermale_33988": "[[I do.]] You and your friend Charles spoke of the Portkey – and of trials you'd created for one who could see traces of ancient magic.",
  "playermale_33989": "His search?",
  "playermale_33990": "These pots and cauldrons haven't moved in ages.",
  "playermale_33991": "We did not, Professor. We encountered goblins outside the tower.",
  "playermale_33992": "[[I believe I have.]] It looks familiar. Perhaps your 'young friend' is more well-travelled than you might think.",
  "playermale_33993": "[[It doesn't look familiar.]] I don't think I have. Perhaps your 'young friend' is not as well-travelled as you think.",
  "playermale_33994": "[[Of course.]] I understand. I'll see what I can learn about the missing pages while you're gone.",
  "playermale_33995": "Very well. Are you able to tell me anything about the next trial?",
  "playermale_33997": "[[It was easy.]] You weren't much of a challenge.",
  "playermale_33998": "[[She sounds fascinating.]] How interesting. I'm amazed I've never heard of her.",
  "playermale_33999": "[[Doesn't sound that impressive.]] She was just good at casting a spell? No wonder I've never heard of her.",
  "playermale_34000": "And you're a third-year, so –",
  "playermale_34001": "I think he simply wants to show me something that involves Gobbledegook. If it helps, he's a friend of Sirona's.",
  "playermale_34002": "[[But you had no choice.]] How else did he expect goblinkind to get the helmet back? Seems he has no interest in making amends with you.",
  "playermale_34003": "[[You should have expected that.]] You said this would repair the 'chasm' between the two of you. How did you not expect him to react this way?",
  "playermale_34005": "If you share Ranrok’s views, then why are you helping me?",
  "playermale_34017": "Miriam.",
  "playermale_34018": "Professor Fig’s wife. He told me of her research – and I know of the container.",
  "playermale_34019": "You think Ranrok murdered her.",
  "playermale_34020": "Thank you, Lodgok. For telling me this.",
  "playermale_34021": "[[I suppose so.]] Of course. I look forward to playing against you.",
  "playermale_34022": "[[Surely you've better things to do.]] Shouldn't you be preparing for your next class, or helping a student?",
  "playermale_34023": "[[You taught me well.]] I had a good teacher.",
  "playermale_34024": "That's the last of Zenobia's Gobstones. I should go and see her.",
  "playermale_34030": "She was. And she pulled emotions – as she did from her father – from Professor Fitzgerald. Without permission.",
  "playermale_34031": "What's more, she said that she found a way to store the traces of magic she extracted – in goblin silver.",
  "playermale_34032": "Lodgok – Lodgok and Ranrok were brothers. Lodgok was bringing the journal to me.",
  "playermale_34035": "Very well.",
  "playermale_34042": "[[I cannot say.]] I'm afraid I can't say. I didn't read the journals.",
  "playermale_34043": "[[Isidora told him.]] Isidora told Bragbor about the magic when she asked him to build a container for her. I've seen her memories.",
  "playermale_34048": "I'm ready to finish Harlow once and for all. What is your plan?",
  "playermale_34056": "I'm eager to try it out.",
  "playermale_34057": "That sounds wonderful, Mr Ollivander.",
  "playermale_34058": "What am I to do with the artefacts, Professor Rackham?",
  "playermale_34059": "Then I must go now and craft this wand. Perhaps Mr Ollivander will help me.",
  "playermale_34062": "We are. And we were glad to help.",
  "playermale_34072": "I need to reposition that pillar to climb out of here. Perhaps the archway is the answer.",
  "playermale_34073": "Perhaps I can only move objects while I'm on the other side of the archway.",
  "playermale_34074": "I need to reposition the pillar whilst on one side of the archway, so that I can climb it on the other side of the archway.",
  "playermale_34075": "That pillar is blocking the path. I'll need to move it.",
  "playermale_34076": "Is there any way to reposition this archway?",
  "playermale_34077": "If I arrange the archway correctly, I should be able to move the pillar and clear the path.",
  "playermale_34078": "I believe I need to proceed to the left here, but how?",
  "playermale_34079": "Perhaps I'm to hit the mark on the far wall. That sort of thing has repositioned the archways in the past.",
  "playermale_34080": "The bridges appear and disappear, depending upon which side of the archway I'm on.",
  "playermale_34081": "There's a pillar here, but no ledge near it for me to grab onto.",
  "playermale_34082": "Hitting those marks readjusts the archways. Perhaps there's a way forward from the other side of this one.",
  "playermale_34083": "Is it possible to pull one of those blocks through the archway?",
  "playermale_34084": "After pulling the block out through the archway, I can place it where it can be climbed on while on the other side of the archway.",
  "playermale_34101": "Highwing's fine. I'm keeping an eye on her. She's safe, Poppy. I promise.",
  "playermale_34103": "[[I'll bring the book here.]] Very well. I'll retrieve the book right away.",
  "playermale_34104": "[[Why is this called the Map Chamber?]] I'm a bit confused, sir. Why is this room called the 'Map Chamber'?",
  "playermale_34105": "[[Are you a Seer?]] The statues and carvings in the house on the cliffside – those are of you. Are you a Seer?",
  "playermale_34106": "[[Can you tell me more about this place?]] What more can you tell me about this place, Professor Rackham?",
  "playermale_34110": "Wait – is the next trial in the Headmaster's office?",
  "playermale_34111": "Are you all right, Anne? I didn't mean to intrude.",
  "playermale_34114": "[[Any rumours going around town?]] Any whisperings of anything going about the town?",
  "playermale_34116": "Otto Dibble works at Gladrags. I should check there.",
  "playermale_34118": "You said you had news about the poachers – and that some of it had to do with me.",
  "playermale_34123": "Only one way to find out.",
  "playermale_34124": "They don't scare me. I want to see whatever it is you need to show me.",
  "playermale_34128": "Sebastian! I've seen this before. This house, the well, the view.",
  "playermale_34129": "This well looks familiar.",
  "playermale_34130": "I found a Pensieve that day in the Restricted Section – with a memory that showed this house. There was a little girl, and a drought –",
  "playermale_34131": "– the Keepers have shown me other memories as well. The girl became a Hogwarts professor. Her name was Isidora Morganach. She was one of the Keepers.",
  "playermale_34137": "Sebastian – this house did belong to a Hogwarts professor. Hundreds of years ago!",
  "playermale_34144": "I can't be sure, of course. But I don't think so. I didn't see any traces of it around your sister.",
  "playermale_34146": "Sebastian – it's been a while.",
  "playermale_34154": "I don't know. But Fig and I think that Ranrok has somehow found a way to harness that magic's power.",
  "playermale_34155": "That's what we're trying to find out.",
  "playermale_34164": "Absolutely, sir.",
  "playermale_34165": "We aren't involved with them. If anything, we want to see them stopped.",
  "playermale_34166": "Please, we don't want any trouble. We're simply passing through.",
  "playermale_34168": "Not a fair one, though. Not with her chained up like that.",
  "playermale_34169": "<i>Revelio</i>?",
  "playermale_34170": "Professor Fig says I have a rare connection to a powerful form of ancient magic.",
  "playermale_34171": "I think so. I'm still learning. But I can see traces of it, and I've cast magic I can't otherwise explain.",
  "playermale_34172": "I'm still learning. But I can see traces of it, and I've cast magic I can't otherwise explain.",
  "playermale_34173": "I know that's a lot to absorb.",
  "playermale_34178": "What do you mean, 'earn' our way out? Do you think this is some sort of test?",
  "playermale_34179": "That glow again. But – on the floor.",
  "playermale_34180": "That statue –",
  "playermale_34181": "I see some sort of statue, but only as a reflection in the floor.",
  "playermale_34182": "Professor Fig?",
  "playermale_34184": "Hello?",
  "playermale_34185": "[[I don't recall it fully.]] I do recall seeing the memory, but I don't remember all of the details.",
  "playermale_34186": "You too, Amit.",
  "playermale_34191": "Still smoking. They can't have been gone long.",
  "playermale_34192": "Why wouldn't they take their cages with them when they left?",
  "playermale_34193": "Pelts. Poor beasts.",
  "playermale_34194": "Into the Forbidden Forest for Bubotubers? I hope it's worth the risk.",
  "playermale_34195": "That smells awful. Only four more, thank goodness.",
  "playermale_34196": "Just my luck – a troll.",
  "playermale_34197": "Now to see if Herodiana Byrne was as good as Sophronia said she was.",
  "playermale_34198": "I see. The switch reset everything. Good to know.",
  "playermale_34199": "That's the last of them. Seems I was a match for Herodiana Byrne after all.",
  "playermale_34204": "How's your Gran doing, by the way?",
  "playermale_34205": "Surely she'll be pleased you've gone after the Snidgets.",
  "playermale_34206": "Ashwinders! I'd better find a way around them. Or perhaps through them –",
  "playermale_34207": "That's the last of them. For now.",
  "playermale_34208": "Now then. Which one of you is Biscuit?",
  "playermale_34210": "Poachers. I need to be careful.",
  "playermale_34211": "Miss Willardsey will never believe where the butterflies led me.",
  "playermale_34212": "What do you mean you'd 'had enough' and 'the worst was over?'",
  "playermale_34213": "So this is the infamous Absconder.",
  "playermale_34214": "Doesn't look like anyone's been down here in ages. Best keep moving.",
  "playermale_34215": "That did the trick.",
  "playermale_34216": "Ah-ha. Got it.",
  "playermale_34217": "(sniff) Something smells sweet. Must be close to Honeydukes.",
  "playermale_34218": "[[I'm just looking.]] Just having a look around, thank you.",
  "playermale_34219": "I'd like to ask you about your shop, if you don't mind.",
  "playermale_34221": "I can't believe it. Rookwood's reign is finally over. I'll need to send an owl to Natty right away.",
  "playermale_34222": "Let's make them count.",
  "playermale_34223": "Impressive. Especially with how little information he gave us.",
  "playermale_34225": "[[Let's poke around this mystery cave.]] Well, we're here. We might as well have a look.",
  "playermale_34227": "[[Why do people avoid the cave?]] Did you discover why people avoid this cave?",
  "playermale_34233": "The wisps of magic seem to be leading me somewhere.",
  "playermale_34234": "Ah. That's where they're leading me. That glow again.",
  "playermale_34236": "Did you need something, Poppy?",
  "playermale_34237": "Well done, Poppy. This did end up being the right cave after all.",
  "playermale_34239": "I'll know it when I see it.",
  "playermale_34240": "I've seen a wall like this before. It must be the way back.",
  "playermale_34241": "[[What will you tell them?]] What will you tell them about Mr Osric's death?",
  "playermale_34244": "[[That would be unwise.]] I should think you'd have better things to do with your time. Ahem. Now where's my elf?",
  "playermale_34245": "[[What exactly is Defence Against the Dark Arts?]] Can you tell me more about the Defence Against the Dark Arts class?",
  "playermale_34246": "[[What's Hogsmeade?]] You mentioned 'Hogsmeade,' Professor?",
  "playermale_34247": "[[Can you tell me more about Charms class?]] What will I learn in Charms class?",
  "playermale_34248": "[[Thank you, Professor.]] Thank you, Professor Weasley.",
  "playermale_34251": "Hello again. Can you help me?",
  "playermale_34252": "Where can I find Jackdaw's head?",
  "playermale_34253": "[[What are the rules?]] Please could you explain the rules again?",
  "playermale_34255": "<i>Revelio</i> could be useful here.",
  "playermale_34257": "I have to believe that only a Slytherin would have been ambitious enough to get this far.",
  "playermale_34258": "I have to believe that only a Hufflepuff would have had the tenacity to get this far.",
  "playermale_34259": "I have to believe that only a Gryffindor would have had the courage to get this far.",
  "playermale_34260": "I have to believe that only a Ravenclaw would have had the intelligence to get this far.",
  "playermale_34261": "I wonder when Professor Fig will be back. I did promise him I wouldn't neglect my studies while he was away.",
  "playermale_34262": "My spells are having no effect on the dragon.",
  "playermale_34263": "It's feeding off the power from the repository.",
  "playermale_34264": "Aside from the birdbath, anything else I should look for?",
  "playermale_34265": "You've been very helpful. Thank you.",
  "playermale_34267": "Here it is. The map that brought your doom, Jackdaw. Hmm. Is there something beyond this room?",
  "playermale_34271": "Yes, Professor.",
  "playermale_34272": "This will be incredibly helpful. Thank you.",
  "playermale_34277": "<i>Expelliarmus</i> ought to disarm you brutes.",
  "playermale_34283": "An Unlocking Charm?",
  "playermale_34284": "It's locked.",
  "playermale_34285": "Well, this isn't ideal.",
  "playermale_34286": "Professor?",
  "playermale_34288": "Not that I recall. What are they?",
  "playermale_34290": "Impressive workmanship aside, it's the only way forward.",
  "playermale_34291": "Not an entanglement we need right now.",
  "playermale_34292": "Are these repositories like the broken container I found at Rookwood Castle?",
  "playermale_34293": "It's Hogwarts.",
  "playermale_34294": "Let's take a closer look.",
  "playermale_34295": "You're good.",
  "playermale_34296": "Let's just say I'm a quick learner.",
  "playermale_34297": "Understood, Professor.",
  "playermale_34301": "Thank you, Professor.",
  "playermale_34302": "[[What more can you tell me about the potions shop?]] Can you tell me more about the potions shop, Professor?",
  "playermale_34303": "[[What? More work?]] I'm not sure I have time for extra assignments, Professor.",
  "playermale_34304": "Lodgok's getting himself into more danger than he realises. I'd better find him.",
  "playermale_34305": "Ranrok is here. I only hope Lodgok doesn't cross paths with him.",
  "playermale_34306": "I can end this right now. I have to destroy the drill and stop Ranrok's Loyalists.",
  "playermale_34307": "I hope I can get to Ranrok before Lodgok does.",
  "playermale_34308": "Poor Lodgok. Dead by his brother's hand. No wonder he tried so hard to reason with him.",
  "playermale_34309": "I'll send word to Fig to meet me in the Map Chamber. He and the Keepers need to know Ranrok has that journal and knows where the final repository is.",
  "playermale_34310": "Thank you, Professor. I enjoyed the match.",
  "playermale_34311": "Of course, Professor. It was a challenging match.",
  "playermale_34312": "Thank you, Sebastian. I'll keep that in mind.",
  "playermale_34314": "Sir – the trolls were wearing armour. It had that dark glow, like the dragon collar.",
  "playermale_34315": "Shall we go?",
  "playermale_34317": "Sebastian mentioned sneaking into the Restricted Section. Perhaps he'll have an idea.",
  "playermale_34318": "Where does this one lead? Off the beaten path I suspect.",
  "playermale_34319": "No sign of Lodgok out here. He must be inside already.",
  "playermale_34320": "How am I being protected? What sort of magic is this?",
  "playermale_34321": "We're not alone?",
  "playermale_34322": "I'm a student at Hogwarts, sir. And this is Professor Fig.",
  "playermale_34323": "I received your owl. I was able to speak with Lodgok – the goblin I mentioned before.",
  "playermale_34324": "[[I do.]] I believe he's trustworthy, yes. He seemed sincere. And Sirona Ryan trusts him.",
  "playermale_34325": "[[Difficult to say.]] He seemed trustworthy. Difficult to know really. But, Sirona Ryan trusts him.",
  "playermale_34326": "Fair enough. In fact, the book was below the Restricted Section, as it appeared on the map.",
  "playermale_34327": "It was a book we were after.",
  "playermale_34328": "I think I know, sir. I saw two more memories where I found the book.",
  "playermale_34329": "The first memory showed him and three other professors using ancient magic to restore a hamlet from a drought.",
  "playermale_34330": "They were talking to a student who started as a fifth-year – like I did. She could see traces of magic too.",
  "playermale_34332": "[[I'd love to hear about it.]] I'd love to hear about how you and Highwing met.",
  "playermale_34333": "[[You seem hesitant. You needn't tell me.]] If you don't want to talk about it, we don't have to.",
  "playermale_34334": "[[Do you worry about being recognised by the poachers?]] We were around so many poachers in the tent. Were you not worried about being recognised?",
  "playermale_34335": "You've seen this before?",
  "playermale_34336": "Is the pattern they left behind on the ground – normal?",
  "playermale_34337": "Could this actually be where the Snidgets are hidden?",
  "playermale_34338": "I'm ready if you are.",
  "playermale_34339": "You knew the poachers would try and kill Poppy and me?",
  "playermale_34340": "I don't suppose you'd like to start from the beginning. I think Poppy and I could use that.",
  "playermale_34347": "Thank you, Professor. I shall keep this second artefact safe, as you've advised.",
  "playermale_34348": "[[I'm ready.]] I'm ready for whatever comes next.",
  "playermale_34350": "[[What did Isidora remove from her father's chest in the memory?]] What was the glowing strand that Isidora pulled from her father's chest?",

  "playermale_34375": "I ought to look around before using the passageway.",
  "playermale_34379": "And I still have that rune symbol we found on the triptych. If there is a connection, I suspect we'll see that symbol again.",
  "playermale_34384": "We should wait.",

  "playermale_34442": "I realise it's a lot to take in.  I'm not even sure I understand it all yet. And, no, not like Quidditch.",

  "playermale_34579": "I'm all right at the moment.",

  "playermale_34586": "[[I can't say.]] I've never met Rookwood or Harlow. Perhaps they mistook me for another student.",
  "playermale_34593": "I've only met Highwing before. Poppy introduced us.",
  "playermale_34595": "Of course. What did the letter say?",
  "playermale_34596": "You seem quite interested in merpeople.",
  "playermale_34597": "[[That sounds suspicious.]] Keeping things from Gran, are we?",
  "playermale_34601": "I did. I found something that I can't identify floating above the last Pensieve.",
  "playermale_34602": "[[I've seen you before.]] We saw you in the Pensieve in Gringotts. With Professor Rackham.",
  "playermale_34603": "[[Have I seen you before?]] You look familiar, sir.",

  "playermale_34605": "Thank you, sir. I will look out for them.",
  "playermale_34606": "Yes, Professor.",
  "playermale_34607": "The Richard Jackdaw? So, Mr Ollivander was right. He wants his family wand back.",
  "playermale_34608": "So – you stole a wand and then followed a map on some pages that you took from Peeves, and followed that map to your doom?",
  "playermale_34609": "I don't, really. Ollivander does. It's the pages I'm after. Might they be with the wand in the cave?",
  "playermale_34610": "What's happening?",
  "playermale_34611": "Aa – aah!",
  "playermale_34612": "You wanted to see me, sir?",
  "playermale_34613": "[[I have some bad news.]] I'm sorry to tell you that Victor Rookwood – evidently your descendant – is a Dark wizard in league with Ranrok.",
  "playermale_34614": "[[But you didn't see anything?]] You didn't see anything? Speak with anyone?",
  "playermale_34615": "And Ranrok knows about the Keepers.",
  "playermale_34616": "And, sir, they know you were a Keeper. Ranrok used the term.",
  "playermale_34617": "Very well, Professor. Tell me where I need to go.",
  "playermale_34618": "Hello, Professor. Did you say San Bakar's tower?",
  "playermale_34619": "[[I'm glad to hear it.]] Good. Rookwood and Harlow are a dangerous pair. And you should know that Rookwood is in league with Ranrok.",
  "playermale_34620": "[[This could be dangerous.]] Rookwood and Harlow are a dangerous pair on their own. And you should know that Rookwood is in league with Ranrok.",
  "playermale_34621": "That may be true, but shouldn't Officer Singer handle someone like Harlow?",
  "playermale_34624": "I did. But something was missing – I'm not sure here is the best place to discuss it.",
  "playermale_34626": "I'm sorry to say that Jackdaw sold it long ago.",
  "playermale_34627": "I did. Thank you again, Scrope. You're a credit to house-elves.",
  "playermale_34628": "That ghost said I should 'blast away to my heart's content.'",
  "playermale_34629": "I suppose there's nothing to be done but obliterate these pumpkins. Seems simple enough.",
  "playermale_34630": "If I want to speak to Jackdaw about those pages, I had better set to work destroying these pumpkins.",
  "playermale_34631": "[[I am.]] I am only joking. I found the location depicted in the painting and then I cast <i>Lumos</i> to guide a moth back to the frame.",
  "playermale_34632": "[[I'm not.]] You should have worked it out on your own.",
  "playermale_34633": "Moths. Curious.",
  "playermale_34634": "Down I go. No other way.",
  "playermale_34635": "This has a moth imprinted on it, the same as the door.",
  "playermale_34636": "Perhaps some light will lead these moths to the door.",
  "playermale_34637": "I see. This is supposed to spin. But how?",
  "playermale_34638": "I know! <i>Depulso</i> should set this spinning.",
  "playermale_34639": "What's that hanging there? Looks precarious.",
  "playermale_34640": "I bet if I knock that down it will open the way forward – down below.",
  "playermale_34641": "[[This could be dangerous.]] Rookwood and Harlow are a dangerous pair on their own. And the fact that they're working with Ranrok, well –",
  "playermale_34642": "[[I'm glad to hear it.]] Good. Rookwood and Harlow are a dangerous pair. And the fact that they're working with Ranrok, well –",
  "playermale_34643": "But why would he think that we had anything to do with poachers?",
  "playermale_34644": "He was certainly a charmer.",
  "playermale_34647": "I'm all right at the moment.",
  "playermale_34648": "All right. But how?",
  "playermale_34652": "The bridge Jackdaw mentioned. I must be going the right way.",
  "playermale_34653": "The waterfall. For a thief, Jackdaw's surprisingly as good as his word.",
  "playermale_34654": "Something oddly solemn about this place. Such regal creatures, stags.",
  "playermale_34655": "No risk those Loyalists will report back to Ranrok now. Let's see where Jackdaw has led me.",
  "playermale_34656": "[[Thank you for your insights.]] Thank you, Professor. I look forward to stargazing.",
  "playermale_34657": "Oh, no. Not this close to the school, Amit.",
  "playermale_34658": "A few cobwebs and some dust. Nothing to be concerned about.",
  "playermale_34659": "Nothing to do now but keep going.",
  "playermale_34660": "Are you certain you don't want to come the rest of the way?",
  "playermale_34661": "Hello Grace, can I help you?",
  "playermale_34662": "There's something back there, beyond the wall. How do I get back there?",
  "playermale_34663": "Whatever Jackdaw left for Anne must be back there, beyond this wall.",
  "playermale_34664": "A note from Jackdaw. Anne never found it. So how did he die? Was she to blame at all?",
  "playermale_34665": "The Richard Jackdaw? I heard you disappeared years ago. You have some explaining to do.",
  "playermale_34666": "Those candles must be important.",
  "playermale_34667": "I see. There must be something to the arrangement of the candles.",
  "playermale_34668": "The candles correspond to the handles I'm to pull in order to open the way forward. <i>Accio</i> should do the trick.",
  "playermale_34669": "[[I'll keep looking.]] Understood. I shall keep an eye out.",
  "playermale_34670": "[[How many statues are there?]] How many statues are there to find?",
  "playermale_34671": "[[What will I get for helping you further?]] You mentioned offering something in exchange for my assistance.",
  "playermale_34674": "[[You don't suppose Harlow took him?]] I don't mean to be grim, but – could Harlow have taken him?",
  "playermale_34675": "[[I'm sure your son is fine.]] He must be around here somewhere. When did you last see him?",
  "playermale_34676": "Do you know which way Archie might have gone?",
  "playermale_34678": "[[We'll find your son.]] We'll find your son, Mrs Bickle.",
  "playermale_34679": "Archie's satchel! Why would he leave it behind?",
  "playermale_34683": "What did Officer Singer say about the letter you brought her?",
  "playermale_34686": "I managed to rescue a Puffskein.",
  "playermale_34687": "I rescued a Jobberknoll.",
  "playermale_34688": "It was a bit trickier than the others, but I have a Mooncalf now.",
  "playermale_34689": "I imagine the Desk of Description will come in handy.",
  "playermale_34690": "Hello, Scrope. Thanks to you, I was able to enter Apollonia's grotto. The toast was the key.",
  "playermale_34691": "I met a ghost there – Richard Jackdaw – who's agreed to lead me to the pages I've been looking for.",
  "playermale_34692": "Your mother sent us to find you.",
  "playermale_34693": "We're so sorry, Archie. We won't let him get away with it. But first we need to get you home to your mother.",
  "playermale_34694": "We wouldn't have it any other way, Archie. Now, let's get you home. We know a safe way back.",
  "playermale_34695": "Your husband's friends may be in danger?",
  "playermale_34696": "How can we help?",
  "playermale_34697": "I'm sorry again about your husband, Mrs Bickle.",
  "playermale_34698": "[[He's already after us.]] It may be too late for that. I'm afraid Harlow's already after us.",
  "playermale_34699": "[[Understood.]] We don't want to worry you.",
  "playermale_34701": "There is. I've seen symbols like these before. I need to find all of them – then cast at them quickly in succession.",
  "playermale_34704": "What was it you needed me to do, Scrope?",
  "playermale_34705": "Wait, Professor. The name 'Rookwood'. Do you think –",
  "playermale_34706": "What is this?",
  "playermale_34707": "The vaults seem to go on forever.",
  "playermale_34708": "Hello Lenora. Could you remind me what's so special about that empty painting?",
  "playermale_34709": "That wasn't so bad, was it?",
  "playermale_34710": "Thank you, Amit. I couldn't have done it without you. Now if you don't mind, I'd like to have a word with Lodgok.",
  "playermale_34711": "They're building enormous drills. We found their plans. Ranrok must be searching for the repositories.",
  "playermale_34712": "I'm glad you came with me, Amit. Now that we know what they're up to, we can get out of here.",
  "playermale_34713": "I'll get us through here safely, Amit. You have my word.",
  "playermale_34714": "Stay close. I've handled much worse.",
  "playermale_34715": "That should be the last of them, Amit.",
  "playermale_34716": "There must be a quicker way out of here than retracing our steps.",
  "playermale_34717": "We're almost out of here, Amit. Look – the lift!",
  "playermale_34718": "She called you her 'little gazelle'. Is that a term of endearment where you're from?",
  "playermale_34719": "[[Perhaps your mother is right.]] She's concerned for your safety. It may be best for you to stay away from Hogsmeade for now.",
  "playermale_34720": "[[We can't allow your mother to stop us.]] We're making good progress. We can't quit now.",
  "playermale_34721": "[[I'll complete the tasks.]] I'll start on the task right away, Professor.",
  "playermale_34722": "[[What is the purpose of the tasks?]] Why must I first complete tasks to learn <i>Reparo</i>?",
  "playermale_34723": "This is the right area. I wonder where the flying page is.",
  "playermale_34724": "A flying page must be around here somewhere.",
  "playermale_34725": "Seems Crossed Wands isn't as secret as it's believed to be.",
  "playermale_34726": "I got here as soon as I could.",
  "playermale_34727": "What's going on here?",
  "playermale_34729": "[[I intend to open it.]] I have decided to open the repository. Its power cannot lie dormant for centuries more.",
  "playermale_34730": "[[I intend to keep it contained here.]] I plan to keep the repository as it is.",
  "playermale_34731": "[[This power should not be kept from the world.]] Isidora knew she had a remarkable power to help people. I intend to use my ability to finish her work. Build upon it.",
  "playermale_34732": "[[I want the power for myself.]] Isidora wasted her ability trying to save people from themselves. I will not let others dictate what I do with this – my – power.",
  "playermale_34733": "[[I shall keep it secret forever.]] The Keepers were right. The risk of using this magic is too dangerous. It is my responsibility alone to keep it safe.",
  "playermale_34734": "[[I shall keep it secret for now.]] I plan to keep it secret for now. But in time, when I am ready, I plan to tell those I trust everything – and accept their help.",
  "playermale_34737": "The dragon that attacked my carriage was wearing a collar. And Professor Fig was genuinely baffled by its behaviour.",
  "playermale_34739": "[[It's to do with Ranrok.]] Rookwood is working with Ranrok. And Ranrok is after something I found at Gringotts.",
  "playermale_34740": "[[I'd rather not say at present.]] If it's all right with you, I'd rather not say. At least not at the moment.",
  "playermale_34743": "[[I'm so sorry, Poppy.]] I'm sorry, Poppy. I'm glad she's all right. I don't think either one of us could have anticipated that.",
  "playermale_34744": "[[What's a Snidget?]] Exactly what kind of creature is a Snidget?",
  "playermale_34751": "[[Did the journal say where the Snidgets were hidden?]] Where exactly are these Snidgets allegedly hidden?",

  "playermale_34823": "May I ask what happened?",
  "playermale_34826": "[[You knew what was in that chest.]] You knew exactly where I was going when I entered that chest.",
  "playermale_34827": "Hello, Penny.",
  "playermale_34828": "[[Our agreement is almost sealed.]] Very well. I shall agree to your contract – with one, small addendum.",
  "playermale_34829": "I did. In order that I have a successful shop with lots of customers, would you agree to causing chaos only after nine o'clock in the evening?",
  "playermale_34830": "I would.",
  "playermale_34831": "Cassandra Mason – was she behind all of this?",

  "playermale_34841": "You're seeking to heal the damage done to your leg?",
  "playermale_34842": "Indeed, sir. Thank you for your time. And I do hope you find a cure for your injury.",
  "playermale_34844": "Professor, do you have time to chat?",
  "playermale_34848": "Some of the professors may not agree with your approach.",
  "playermale_34849": "And that’s why you teach the way you do?",
  "playermale_34850": "[[How unfortunate.]] I'm sorry to hear that, sir. It sounds as if your experience as a student was less than ideal.",
  "playermale_34851": "I'll do my best, Professor. Thank you for the advice.",
  "playermale_34852": "[[You mentioned your education wasn't traditional.]] Professor, what did you mean when you said your education wasn't 'traditional'?",
  "playermale_34858": "[[I'm glad that you did.]] I for one am glad. I very much enjoy your class.",

  "playermale_34861": "I'd better keep an eye on high places around the school for Zenobia's Gobstones.",
  "playermale_34862": "Well that's one of Zenobia's Gobstones. I hardly see what all the fuss is about.",
  "playermale_34863": "Just one more Gobstone.",
  "playermale_34864": "[[I'm so sorry.]] I understand you've tried everyone from Nurse Blainey to St Mungo's to no avail.",

  "playermale_34881": "I still can't believe we escaped the Ashwinders.",
  "playermale_34882": "I wonder how everyone knows about it.",
  "playermale_34884": "I'm sorry. Has Officer Singer done anything with the evidence we provided?",
  "playermale_34887": "The cave must be somewhere in this – maze. I wonder what else is in here.",
  "playermale_34888": "I shall look forward to it.",
  "playermale_34889": "Hello. Were you calling me?",
  "playermale_34891": "[[Perhaps it made you who you are.]] Perhaps you wouldn't be who you are without that experience.",
  "playermale_34892": "This stairwell looks promising.",
  "playermale_34894": "[[It's not your fault.]] It's not your fault, Natty. There's nothing you could have done to prevent it.",
  "playermale_34895": "[[I'm sorry.]] I'm sorry, Natty. I wish there was something I could do to help.",
  "playermale_34901": "I agree, Natty. We'll get them. I've never seen someone so committed to a cause.",
  "playermale_34903": "Professor Weasley wanted to speak with me after class.",
  "playermale_34906": "Harlow knows that we saved Archie. And that we rescued Mr Rabe. The letter didn't come from Mrs Bickle, did it?",
  "playermale_34907": "[[We should take a moment.]] I don't know if we should be rushing into this.",
  "playermale_34908": "[[I'm ready.]] Agreed. Let's finish this.",
  "playermale_34909": "Fair point. All right. Let's go.",
  "playermale_34910": "But she warned us to stay out of it. Was rather adamant about it.",
  "playermale_34911": "Perhaps we ought to inform Officer Singer of our plans.",

  "playermale_34913": "[[Any idea where to start?]] Where do you suggest I search first?",
  "playermale_34915": "No they didn't. Rookwood and Harlow are after me.",
  "playermale_34916": "Professor Fig told me to keep things quiet – but I know I can trust you, Natty.",
  "playermale_34917": "Rookwood and Harlow want something Professor Fig and I found at Gringotts.",
  "playermale_34918": "Just before I came to Hogwarts. In fact, it's why I was late to the Sorting Ceremony.",
  "playermale_34919": "A Portkey brought us there after the dragon attacked our carriage.",
  "playermale_34921": "I think that was all of them.",
  "playermale_34922": "It is a little strange we haven't heard anything from them.",
  "playermale_34924": "I hope we haven't kept you waiting long, Dorran.",
  "playermale_34925": "We do.",
  "playermale_34926": "What makes you say that?",
  "playermale_34927": "So many books!",
  "playermale_34928": "Whoever built this place certainly liked to read.",
  "playermale_34929": "Your Gran would love it here.",
  "playermale_34930": "Not Dorran, that's for certain.",
  "playermale_34931": "Always armed and ready for a fight, Ranrok's Loyalists.",
  "playermale_34934": "Where is he?",
  "playermale_34935": "That platform is just out of reach.",
  "playermale_34936": "I can use <i>Accio</i> on that platform below.",
  "playermale_34937": "I see a platform below. I wonder if I could use it.",
  "playermale_34938": "I'm glad to see you're doing so well.",
  "playermale_34939": "I am sorry, Natty. It's my fault you got hurt.",
  "playermale_34940": "[[You didn't think about it. You just acted.]] You did what came naturally.",
  "playermale_34941": "[[You made a choice to protect me.]] You quickly made the choice to protect me.",
  "playermale_34942": "Then I shouldn't feel guilty?",
  "playermale_34943": "From what I know of him, it seems there's a lot of your father in you.",

  "playermale_34947": "Hello? There's a voice coming from that well.",
  "playermale_34948": "There's something about that tree –",

  "playermale_34950": "The candles seem to be leading into the Forbidden Forest.",
  "playermale_34951": "The treasure must be nearby.",
  "playermale_34952": "Treasure hunting suits me.",

  "playermale_34960": "[[Second and third thoughts.]] Believe me, I am having thoughts – but I'm still convinced we should go ahead.",
  "playermale_34961": "[[None at all.]] I see no reason we should stop now.",
  "playermale_34963": "Understandable. We did sabotage their fighting ring and steal a dragon egg from them.",

  "playermale_34967": "You want me to – follow the butterflies?",

  "playermale_34972": "It seems as though things are getting worse. Best be on my guard.",
  "playermale_34973": "It sounds as if her astrolabe is just northeast of the dock. I should dive down and see.",
  "playermale_34974": "[[We're actually working together.]] I did, thank you. In fact, we're working together to try and rein in Ranrok.",
  "playermale_34975": "I – of course. Your owl mentioned your needing my help with something.",

  "playermale_34979": "Oh – I'm terribly sorry, Mrs Bickle. Who killed your husband?",
  "playermale_34980": "I suspect he'll keep running if he's being followed.",

  "playermale_35099": "But now we have the upper hand. We can prepare.",
  "playermale_35103": "I see Dorran finally convinced you to leave the Snidgets.",
  "playermale_35104": "[[I was happy to help a friend.]] Of course. It's the sort of thing friends do for each other, isn't it?",
  "playermale_35105": "[[I'm always happy to put poachers in their place.]] You can always count on me for a fight when it comes to poachers.",
  "playermale_35106": "Had you never been to the Three Broomsticks?",
  "playermale_35107": "[[You should widen your circle.]] Highwing is nice company, but perhaps it's time to add a few more friends to your circle.",
  "playermale_35108": "[[Highwing's good company.]] Nothing wrong with that. Highwing's good company.",
  "playermale_35109": "Speaking of secrets, I do want to tell you why Victor Rookwood's after me. He's working with Ranrok.",
  "playermale_35112": "That's right.",
  "playermale_35113": "We need allies. Others who hate the poachers enough to help us – who value creatures as much as – ",
  "playermale_35115": "[[We should check on her.]] That's a good idea. We need to see this through.",
  "playermale_35116": "[[Haven't we done enough for her?]] Must we? Seems a lot of trouble to go to for a creature we've already rescued.",
  "playermale_35117": "Exactly.",
  "playermale_35118": "[[I trust him. Centaurs know things.]] I don't know, but I am inclined to believe him – what with his being a centaur and all.",
  "playermale_35119": "[[He was annoyingly cryptic.]] He could have been a bit clearer or stayed a moment and answered our questions.",
  "playermale_35120": "[[Isn't moonstone common?]] Isn't moonstone all around us? Why retrieve one from a cave?",
  "playermale_35121": "That's what the leader of the herd called him.",
  "playermale_35122": "[[Why not try to save all the Diricawls?]] Why are you fixated on Gwyneira and not rescuing all the Diricawls?",
  "playermale_35123": "[[What does the Diricawl den look like?]] Can you tell me what the Diricawl den looks like?",
  "playermale_35124": "Miss Moffett, could you remind me what you needed me to do again please?",
  "playermale_35125": "Seems these journal entries are from Isidora's travels.",
  "playermale_35126": "[[You were wise not to speak out.]] You may have shared Mr Bickle's fate if you had spoken out against Harlow as he requested.",
  "playermale_35127": "[[You should have spoken out.]] If you had spoken out against him as Mr Bickle asked, perhaps Harlow would be locked away by now.",
  "playermale_35128": "Mr Philbert – would you mind repeating what Harlow did to you? I want to understand correctly.",
  "playermale_35129": "<i>Revelio</i> ought to make quick work of this.",
  "playermale_35131": "[[What happened to Jackdaw's ghost?]] You said Jackdaw's ghost appeared briefly then vanished. Where do you think he went?",
  "playermale_35132": "[[Her concern is warranted.]] I don't blame her for being concerned. We have been involved in some dangerous activities.",
  "playermale_35133": "[[She should be proud of you.]] If she knew more about what you've done, I suspect she'd be proud.",
  "playermale_35134": "(chuckle) Has Officer Singer done anything with the evidence we provided?",
  "playermale_35138": "[[I doubt it's dangerous.]] I don't think Dorran would knowingly send us into danger.",
  "playermale_35139": "[[It'd better have to do with Snidgets.]] Whatever it is, it had better have to do with Snidgets.",
  "playermale_35140": "Natty? Is everything all right?",
  "playermale_35144": "For better or for worse, we're in.",
  "playermale_35145": "Can this be? I think I'm invisible.",
  "playermale_35146": "I've never felt such power.",
  "playermale_35147": "[[How do you track a dragon's flight?]] How do you track a dragon long after she's gone?",
  "playermale_35148": "[[Well done.]] Well done. You certainly know what you are doing!",
  "playermale_35149": "We can. But, perhaps best not to tell anyone else about this for now. Even Ominis.",
  "playermale_35151": "I think we're going to be a bit distracted from runes for a moment.",
  "playermale_35152": "Ranrok's Loyalists never knew to look for it.",
  "playermale_35153": "A cavern within a cavern. I'm intrigued.",
  "playermale_35154": "Isidora and Percival Rackham – another of the Keepers – could see traces of ancient magic too.",
  "playermale_35156": "[[Happy to help.]] I'm glad I could be of help. Mrs Sprottle sends her best.",
  "playermale_35157": "They call themselves 'Keepers' because they're protecting some type of knowledge. It has to do with the vault at Gringotts.",
  "playermale_35158": "It is all a bit much, isn't it? – when you put it like that. The point is, we both have good reason to search this house –",
  "playermale_35159": "– you for answers about what happened to Anne, and me for answers about the Keepers.",
  "playermale_35160": "Fair enough. I can see the Undercroft through this stone wall – as though it's a window. This has happened before.",
  "playermale_35161": "That's true. And I'm still not sure what it all means.",
  "playermale_35162": "What I do know is that my ability allows me to travel through these 'windows' I see.",
  "playermale_35163": "There's one more thing. It's a bit odd, if I'm honest.",
  "playermale_35164": "Professor Fig says I have a rare connection to a powerful form of ancient magic.",
  "playermale_35165": "I'm still learning. But I can see traces of it, and I've cast magic I can't otherwise explain.",
  "playermale_35166": "I think so. I'm still learning. But I can see traces of it, and I've cast magic I can't otherwise explain.",
  "playermale_35167": "I know that's a lot to take in.",
  "playermale_35168": "[[The assignments have helped.]] Thank you, Professor. The extra assignments have been helpful.",
  "playermale_35169": "I don't think Mr Pemberton meant to use his own stationery. He knows something about those Demiguise moons.",
  "playermale_35170": "Pardon me sir, but about those curious Demiguise statues I've seen.",
  "playermale_35171": "[[I find them intriguing.]] They're quite clever.",
  "playermale_35172": "[[They're terrorising Gladwin Moon.]] They're causing Mr Moon terrible distress.",
  "playermale_35173": "[[Hogwarts caretaker is an important job.]] Mr Moon does a good deal for the school. And he's taught me a lot. He's terrified of those statues.",
  "playermale_35174": "[[He's too big for his boots.]] He is a bit much – for a caretaker. But he means well. And he's terrified of those statues.",
  "playermale_35178": "[[It was your friend from school.]] It was an old schoolmate of yours – Piers Pemberton.",
  "playermale_35179": "[[I don't think he likes that nickname.]] I don't think he likes being called that.",
  "playermale_35180": "[[Yes, him.]] Yes, him. That's the one.",
  "playermale_35181": "True. Perhaps this triptych will lead us to answers.",
  "playermale_35182": "[[Despite spending so much time on assignments.]] I'm glad to hear it. I'm not certain I needed all the extra assignments.",
  "playermale_35183": "Give me a moment. I'll explain in a second.",
  "playermale_35184": "Perhaps the book Professor Weasley wants me to get is upstairs.",
  "playermale_35185": "That's incredible. You know this area well.",
  "playermale_35186": "Do you think there's a connection to the triptych?",
  "playermale_35187": "Perhaps we could simply enjoy this victory for a moment.",
  "playermale_35188": "I suppose so.",
  "playermale_35191": "But if she was using the Undercroft – and the cellar beneath her manor in Feldcroft – why would she create this space?",
  "playermale_35192": "His are some of the memories I've seen. I don't think he and Isidora saw eye to eye on how this magic should be used.",
  "playermale_35193": "And the bad news?",
  "playermale_35194": "It's clear from her journal that Isidora Morganach was here.",
  "playermale_35195": "Are you finished with the drawing?",
  "playermale_35196": "[[I'm ready to leave.]] Agreed. I'm ready to leave if you are.",
  "playermale_35197": "[[I'm not ready to leave.]] That sounds a fine idea, but I would like to look around a little before we leave.",
  "playermale_35200": "I suppose it is rather late, isn't it?",
  "playermale_35201": "[[I'm ready to leave.]] Yes, please. I'm ready to leave if you are.",
  "playermale_35202": "[[I'm not ready to leave.]] Not just yet. I'm still looking around.",
  "playermale_35203": "The passage ends here? There must be another way through.",
  "playermale_35204": "Could I use a spell to move some of these barrels?",
  "playermale_35205": "Each of these barrels needs to be pulled up to the line on the floor.",
  "playermale_35206": "I don't understand. What can I do to help?",
  "playermale_35207": "The Grey Lady. I'd say hello, but she doesn't seem particularly social.",
  "playermale_35208": "A moth? Curious.",
  "playermale_35209": "Moths are attracted to light.",
  "playermale_35210": "I ought to see how the moth reacts to <i>Lumos</i>.",
  "playermale_35211": "This is a bit more complicated.",
  "playermale_35212": "There must be another moth nearby.",
  "playermale_35213": "I ought to stand on the pillar as it ascends.",
  "playermale_35214": "The floor looks a little weak here.",
  "playermale_35215": "Perhaps the only way forward – is down.",
  "playermale_35216": "I ought to use the crate to break through the floor here.",
  "playermale_35217": "This looks even more complex.",
  "playermale_35218": "Making this spin ought to raise that platform. That must be it.",
  "playermale_35219": "I need to bring moths to the door.",
  "playermale_35220": "What did that burst of magic do? Perhaps I should examine things from both sides of the archway.",
  "playermale_35221": "The room changes when I move in and out of the archway.",
  "playermale_35222": "I can see a way out on one side, but when I pass through the archway, it's blocked by a wall.",
  "playermale_35223": "What did that burst of magic change on both sides of the archway? Something must be different.",
  "playermale_35224": "I need to see how the room changes when I move in and out of the archway.",
  "playermale_35225": "So that's it. I need to use both sides of the archway to get the platform to the other side of the bridge.",
  "playermale_35226": "Now to see what's changed on each side of this archway.",
  "playermale_35227": "Things are definitely different on either side of the archway, but how?",
  "playermale_35228": "What if I stood on one platform and used <i>Accio</i> on the other? That ought to work.",
  "playermale_35229": "Are you the reason students have been seeing Hippogriffs flying above the Forbidden Forest?",
  "playermale_35230": "I wonder what's under these vines?",
  "playermale_35231": "I should use <i>Incendio</i> to burn these vines away.",
  "playermale_35232": "I should be able to burn away these webs.",
  "playermale_35233": "<i>Incendio</i> ought to make quick work of these webs.",
  "playermale_35234": "I can shoot the symbol, but it doesn't stay lit for long.",
  "playermale_35235": "I need to light all three before they time out on me.",
  "playermale_35236": "Oh! Behind the rock. There's the symbol.",
  "playermale_35237": "I'll need to look around for the symbol.",
  "playermale_35238": "Perhaps the next symbol is hidden somewhere.",
  "playermale_35239": "Perhaps it's under the platform.",
  "playermale_35240": "[[Thank you, Deek.]] Thank you for your help, Deek.",
  "playermale_35241": "We're being watched. By a door.",
  "playermale_35242": "We won't get through as long as we can be seen by that eye.",
  "playermale_35243": "I should use disillusionment. That eye won't see a thing.",
  "playermale_35244": "The door is looking at us.",
  "playermale_35245": "We need to break its line of sight somehow.",
  "playermale_35246": "Disillusionment should get us through that door.",
  "playermale_35247": "We'll need to get across this gap somehow.",
  "playermale_35248": "There ought to be something around here to help cross the gap.",
  "playermale_35249": "<i>Accio</i> ought to bring that platform closer. That could help bridge the gap.",
  "playermale_35250": "Another boiler. But it's not boiling.",
  "playermale_35251": "This should work the same way as the last one.",
  "playermale_35252": "<i>Incendio</i> should get this boiler working.",
  "playermale_35253": "[[It was someone you bullied in school.]] It was a classmate of yours that you bullied – Piers Pemberton.",
  "playermale_35254": "I need to keep going forward somehow.",
  "playermale_35255": "What can I use to make my way through here?",
  "playermale_35256": "<i>Accio</i> should bring that platform right to me.",
  "playermale_35257": "I wonder where these pipes go?",
  "playermale_35258": "Those pipes must power something around here.",
  "playermale_35259": "<i>Incendio</i> ought to light the boiler and provide some power to these machines.",
  "playermale_35260": "Another boiler. Crafty goblins.",
  "playermale_35261": "If this is anything like last time, I need to fire up this boiler to supply power to the pipes.",
  "playermale_35262": "<i>Incendio</i> will light this. Then I can move along from here once and for all.",
  "playermale_35263": "I have to find a way to stop that drill.",
  "playermale_35264": "The pillars are weakening.",
  "playermale_35265": "Destroying the pillars will bring the ceiling down on the drill.",
  "playermale_35266": "No, Sebastian. I haven't. You're not listening to me.",
  "playermale_35267": "He's in Hogsmeade, apparently. Perhaps I shall pay him a visit.",
  "playermale_35268": "(gasp)",
  "playermale_35269": "(pained cry)",
  "playermale_35270": "Mr Moon, I've learned who's behind the Demiguise statues.",
  "playermale_35271": "There must be something here that I need.",
  "playermale_35272": "Perhaps something here belongs in the portrait frame.",
  "playermale_35273": "Perhaps I should try casting <i>Lumos</i> near that moth.",
  "playermale_35274": "I should check the map again for clues.",
  "playermale_35275": "One more to go and I'll make it across.",
  "playermale_35276": "Something is getting in the way of that platform.",
  "playermale_35277": "Perhaps I should cast <i>Accio</i> to get that frame out of the way first.",
  "playermale_35306": "Professor, what made you want to teach Herbology?",
  "playermale_35308": "Oh dear. A shame for him, but it worked out well for you.",
  "playermale_35310": "[[That's awful.]] What a string of bad luck.",
  "playermale_35311": "[[That's almost comical.]] Fair bit of bad luck there, I'd say.",
  "playermale_35312": "[[I'm glad things worked out as they did.]] I'm glad everything worked out as it did, and that you're the Herbology professor now.",
  "playermale_35313": "[[I feel sorry for the former professor.]] I had no idea. How awful.",
  "playermale_35315": "Professor Garlick. A moment of your time?",
  "playermale_35316": "[[What made you want to teach Herbology?]] I was wondering – what made you want to teach Herbology?",
  "playermale_35317": "[[Never mind.]] Apologies, Professor. Perhaps later.",
  "playermale_35318": "Professor, I was wondering where you're from – what's your background?",
  "playermale_35319": "[[Sounds lovely.]]That sounds lovely. All the sights and bustle of a city.",
  "playermale_35320": "[[I expected a farm.]]Forgive me. I was sure you must've been raised in the countryside.",
  "playermale_35328": "Professor, may we speak again?",
  "playermale_35329": "[[I was wondering where you were from?]]I was curious to know more about your background.",
  "playermale_35330": "[[Never mind.]]Actually, now isn't the best time after all.",
  "playermale_35355": "During class, you mentioned the Toyohashi Quidditch team.",
  "playermale_35362": "But it wasn't your fault. You didn't know about the potion in the tea.",
  "playermale_35364": "Professor, do you have a moment?",
  "playermale_35365": "[[You mentioned the Toyohashi Quidditch team.]] In class, I heard you mention the Toyohashi Quidditch team.",
  "playermale_35366": "[[Never mind.]] Sorry, never mind.",
  "playermale_35379": "There's something intriguing about that tree.",
  "playermale_35380": "Perhaps I could get that tree to move.",
  "playermale_35381": "Casting <i>Levioso</i> ought to raise the tree out of the ground.",
  "playermale_35382": "More crystallised stone. That must be the way back to the Map Chamber.",
  "playermale_35383": "Another Pensieve.",
  "playermale_35384": "More traces of ancient magic. Something must be different.",
  "playermale_35385": "Each side is different somehow.",
  "playermale_35386": "I must remember to examine these archways from both sides.",
  "playermale_35387": "The room around me has changed again.",
  "playermale_35388": "When I pass through the archway, I enter another room entirely. A new room.",
  "playermale_35389": "Orders. Directly from Ranrok.",
  "playermale_35390": "Perhaps these blocks can be moved.",
  "playermale_35391": "These blocks must be moved in order for me to climb up.",
  "playermale_35392": "I should try casting <i>Depulso</i> to move those blocks.",
  "playermale_35393": "I need to move the blocks into place to jump this gap.",
  "playermale_35394": "Perhaps I should get the blocks back to the starting position.",
  "playermale_35395": "Perhaps casting at that object over there will help somehow.",
  "playermale_35396": "That platform looks like it ought to get me where I need to go.",
  "playermale_35397": "Ominis, Sebastian meant well – ",
  "playermale_35398": "I suppose I should watch for Gwyneira. At night, apparently.",
  "playermale_35399": "[[I could keep her.]] Sounds as if she needs rescuing. I know the perfect place.",
  "playermale_35400": "[[You'd be better than poachers.]] Seems you're more concerned with the feathers than the bird. But she'd be safer with you than with poachers.",
  "playermale_35401": "It doesn't work like that. To access each of these memories, I have to complete a trial. It's not as easy as you think.",
  "playermale_35402": "They're showing me the memories in a particular order. They – ",
  "playermale_35403": "[[Of course I do.]] Of course I care, Sebastian. We've come this far. Don't let your frustration get the better of you.",
  "playermale_35404": "[[Perhaps I should do this on my own.]] I do care about Anne, but I'm tired of explaining myself. Perhaps we should part ways.",
  "playermale_35405": "We don't have a choice.",
  "playermale_35406": "I know.",
  "playermale_35407": "Now, shall we see why the triptych led us here?",
  "playermale_35408": "All right.",
  "playermale_35409": "Listen to me. I know you're angry and frustrated. But charging ahead now could undo all the progress we've made.",
  "playermale_35410": "Lodgok said –",
  "playermale_35411": "Stop it. That's enough. Not all goblins are like Ranrok. I am not the enemy. We want the same thing: to find answers.",
  "playermale_35412": "We do. Listen to me. Lodgok has insights into Ranrok that we don't.",
  "playermale_35413": "Good. Ranrok clearly knows more than we thought. We need to be careful and do this right. Not just go charging in.",
  "playermale_35415": "They attacked you?",
  "playermale_35416": "I know Mr Hill. He was kind to me the day of the troll attack.",
  "playermale_35420": "In addition to abducting Mr Rabe – to blackmail his wife – and Natty, Rookwood and Harlow have also extorted Agabus Philbert and Otto Dibble.",
  "playermale_35421": "[[Perhaps I'm not.]] And you're not who I thought you to be. Based upon your diary, you seem terribly judgemental.",
  "playermale_35422": "[[I'm only joking.]] I wouldn't do that to you, Cressida. Only trying to teach you to be a little more careful.",
  "playermale_35440": "There must be some sort of clue on the painting itself.",
  "playermale_35441": "I wonder what casting <i>Accio</i> on that ring atop the painting would do?",
  "playermale_35459": "Are you concerned she might tell your mother?",
  "playermale_35460": "That I do.",
  "playermale_35461": "He told me that Ranrok somehow knows about the Keepers and is searching anywhere connected to each of them.",
  "playermale_35462": "That's why they always seem to be one step ahead. I know what I'm doing. You need to trust me, or I don't see that we can continue together.",
  "playermale_35463": "We have our work cut out for us. We need to work together if we're going to find the final piece to the triptych.",
  "playermale_35464": "Now to get out of this blasted place.",
  "playermale_35465": "But I don't understand why she seems to have gone to such great lengths to tell her story without their knowledge.",
  "playermale_35466": "So do I.",
  "playermale_35470": "Believe it or not, it's in the Headmaster's office.",
  "playermale_35471": "Now, to free Arn's carts.",
  "playermale_35472": "Professor Fitzgerald seemed very concerned.",
  "playermale_35473": "So, how do you already have Polyjuice Potion to change into Professor Black?",
  "playermale_35474": "I do. And, thank you Sharp. I just hope you've brewed enough for all my boils.",
  "playermale_35475": "Interesting way to hide some treasure.",
  "playermale_35476": "Prime potion ingredient. And I know you fancy yourself a skilled potioneer.",
  "playermale_35477": "Bah! That's enough from you. Just know that I have eyes and ears everywhere.",
  "playermale_35478": "I say – why don't you bring a sample of your next batch to my office? I'd like to give it a try.",
  "playermale_35479": "What was that, Broom?",
  "playermale_35480": "Obviously.",
  "playermale_35481": "Ah, yes, of course. I order you to pronounce it for me.",
  "playermale_35482": "Ah, Professor Weasley. How, er, delightful to see you.",
  "playermale_35483": "Ah! Since I have you here, I wonder if I might – um – speak with you about Professor Fig.",
  "playermale_35484": "I've decided to give him a bit more, er, leeway with his time.",
  "playermale_35485": "[[He's handling secret Ministry matters.]] Ah. Well, yes. He's handling some official Ministry business for me.",
  "playermale_35486": "Ahem, I mean, I shall keep an eye on Fig. You simply keep doing the wonderful job that you're doing. Simply wonderful.",
  "playermale_35487": "Good. Good. That will be all Weasley – er – I mean Professor Weasley. Good day.",
  "playermale_35491": "The final canvas piece to the triptych. We've done it!",
  "playermale_35492": "[[Oh, really?]] Really? Why can't we talk about potions here? Seems fine to me.",
  "playermale_35493": "This door must need power from something.",
  "playermale_35494": "Looks as if there are pipes leading into it.",
  "playermale_35495": "If I light the boiler, the door should open.",
  "playermale_35497": "<i>Imperio</i>!",
  "playermale_35498": "Step aside, Ominis. Stay in place until we're out of sight.",
  "playermale_35499": "Young? I know. You must be Professor Bakar.",
  "playermale_35500": "Pleased to meet you. The Pensieve memory I just witnessed – was Isidora inhaling painful emotions?",
  "playermale_35501": "[[It was fascinating.]] I was amazed to see that it seemed to give her some sort of power – and that she could harness it. But how?",
  "playermale_35502": "[[It was disturbing.]] I found it disturbing. But how did she gain power from it? How did she harness it?",
  "playermale_35503": "I can assure you, Professor, I do. In fact, what you don't yet know is that a dangerous goblin called Ranrok has accessed the repository at Rookwood Castle.",
  "playermale_35504": "He has learned to harness the contents of it as a source of immense power. He plans to use that power against wizardkind. We have no time to waste.",
  "playermale_35506": "Possibly. There's something I didn't get a chance to tell you earlier – Ranrok has been digging at locations tied to the five names he found in the journals of a goblin metalworker named Bragbor.",
  "playermale_35508": "Precisely. That's how he's been one step ahead of us. Gringotts, the tower, Rookwood Castle.",
  "playermale_35509": "Perhaps. I hope to hear from Lodgok soon. I haven't heard anything since I learned of the drills.",
  "playermale_35510": "And I discovered that they're building massive drills to help in their search.",
  "playermale_35511": "[[And I don't miss him.]] I realise that – and I'd like to keep it that way.",
  "playermale_35512": "[[You were rather careless.]] You ought to be more cautious in the future. Men like Rookwood and Harlow could do much worse than stealing a book.",
  "playermale_35513": "[[Centaurs may be too hostile to help.]] Centaurs aren't known for being the friendliest lot. Especially not with wizardkind – and not right now.",
  "playermale_35514": "[[People don't give creatures enough credit.]] Creatures are a lot cleverer than most people realise.",
  "playermale_35515": "How charming. They keep in touch with each other.",
  "playermale_35516": "Watch your step.",
  "playermale_35517": "[[But everything's fine now.]] If your gran's all right, and they didn't get the egg, then perhaps we're fine.",
  "playermale_35518": "It looks as if a way out has appeared in one of the rooms.",
  "playermale_35519": "Once again, this archway allows me to step between completely different rooms.",
  "playermale_35520": "(cough) What? Ahem. Goodness. You cannot believe everything you hear, Professor. No, no, no you cannot.",
  "playermale_35521": "Thank you, Professor.",
  "playermale_35522": "[[Yes.]] Professor Fig has encouraged me to explore when I can – in, er, an effort to complete my Field Guide.",
  "playermale_35523": "[[No.]] Not at all. I was, er, merely interested in learning more about the Auror Programme. I saw Professor Sharp's Auror badge and was intrigued.",
  "playermale_35524": "[[No.]] Not at all. I, uh, enjoy talking to Mr Ollivander. I'm fascinated by wandlore. And I'd never visited the Owlery. Bit of a mess. (chuckle)",
  "playermale_35525": "[[No.]] Not at all. I was, er, intrigued by stories of a giant squid and wanted to learn more. I encountered Scrope – who seemed delighted to share what he knew.",
  "playermale_35526": "[[No.]] Not at all. I'm fascinated by ghosts, and, uh, food. And I was interested in learning more about the castle and the surrounding area.",
  "playermale_35527": "That must be the way to the repository.",
  "playermale_35528": "More of them!",
  "playermale_35529": "This one's almost down.",
  "playermale_35530": "Professor! More trouble ahead.",
  "playermale_35532": "After what Ranrok did to that goblin banker at Gringotts, I shouldn't be surprised at what happened to Arn.",
  "playermale_35533": "Past the ruins – I'm on the right track.",
  "playermale_35534": "Those traces of magic are somehow protecting the dragon.",
  "playermale_35535": "That did the trick. I have you now, Ranrok.",
  "playermale_35536": "I know you're feeling it now, Ranrok.",
  "playermale_35537": "You've protected yourself again. Not for long.",
  "playermale_35538": "Two sources of power?",
  "playermale_35539": "There's nowhere to hide now, Ranrok.",
  "playermale_35540": "I will defeat you. In Lodgok's memory.",
  "playermale_35541": "This is for Professor Fig!",
  "playermale_35542": "Not so powerful now, are you Ranrok?",
  "playermale_35543": "This is the end, you monster.",
  "playermale_35544": "I need to break its connection to those traces of magic.",
  "playermale_35545": "I imagine a piece of that enormous Venomous Tentacula would be enough for Duncan to prove his bravery.",
  "playermale_35546": "I – I suppose being an Auror is dreadfully dangerous. I'm sorry.",
  "playermale_35547": "Well said, Professor.",
  "playermale_35548": "[[You can't fight fate.]] If it truly is fate, seems there's not much you can do about it.",
  "playermale_35549": "[[Fear won't steer me either.]] I'll not let fear dictate my future either.",
  "playermale_35550": "I'm nearly finished. Only one more vase.",
  "playermale_35551": "Her memories showed what she did for her father – which I also saw in Professor Rookwood's Pensieve –",
  "playermale_35552": "– and a conversation with Bragbor in which she expressed frustration about the limits being placed on her use of ancient magic.",
  "playermale_35553": "Quite an enchantment. The carts are returning to Arn.",
  "playermale_35554": "Sounds like Feldcroft's in trouble. Perhaps I should try to help.",
  "playermale_35555": "That crate of Chinese Chomping Cabbages is somewhere in this camp.",
  "playermale_35556": "Ranrok's Loyalists are hiding out near Feldcroft. They must have the other crate of Chinese Chomping Cabbages.",
  "playermale_35557": "That's all of the crates of Chinese Chomping Cabbages. I'd better go and see Mr Thistlewood's friend in Feldcroft.",
  "playermale_35558": "That's one crate in hand. I only need one more.",
  "playermale_35562": "[[It was difficult.]] The ones I faced were determined to make things difficult.",
  "playermale_35563": "[[It was no trouble.]] I managed to free your carts fairly easily.",
  "playermale_35564": "Poppy – something's going on behind you.",
  "playermale_35565": "What now? She didn't exactly leave us a calling card.",
  "playermale_35566": "[[Let's get out of here.]] We aren't helping ourselves standing here. Let's get to safety; we can sort this out later.",
  "playermale_35568": "[[What should we do with the egg?]] Since the dragon we freed flew off, does that mean we get to keep the egg?",
  "playermale_35569": "[[Do you think the poachers will retaliate?]] Should we expect trouble from the poachers? Given the trouble we just caused?",
  "playermale_35570": "It seems Arn's whole life is in those carts. I hope I can find them.",
  "playermale_35574": "I take it this means you had some luck at the library?",
  "playermale_35575": "I also know the promise, Professor. With all I have learned, I can avoid making the same mistakes Isidora did. I can learn to wield this magic for good.",
  "playermale_35576": "[[You're right.]] No, you're right. I haven't forgotten. The cost is too high. Perhaps this magic is best kept contained.",
  "playermale_35577": "Professor!",
  "playermale_35578": "[[Nothing comes to mind.]] That will be all. Thank you for your time.",
  "playermale_35579": "I agree, Natty. We'll get him. I've never seen someone so committed to a cause.",
  "playermale_35580": "It's good to see you again, Dorran. Did Poppy tell you about everything that's happened?",
  "playermale_35581": "What is it?",
  "playermale_35582": "Professor Weasley's tasks are complete. I should attend Transfiguration.",
  "playermale_35583": "[[Have you heard from your parents?]]  I don't suppose you've heard anything from your parents, have you?",
  "playermale_35584": "[[Did you tell your Gran we found the Snidgets?]] Does your Gran know that we found the Snidgets?",
  "playermale_35585": "[[Stay out of trouble, Poppy.]]  It has all been a pleasure, Poppy. Do try and stay out of trouble.",
  "playermale_35587": "There’s the Hogwarts Express. Must be returning from an unscheduled run.",
  "playermale_35588": "Best keep that little manoeuvre between us, Highwing.",
  "playermale_35589": "Looks as if there's more than one way to enter.",
  "playermale_35590": "And that's when you took over as the Herbology professor?",
  "playermale_35593": "Have I not proven myself, Professor? I need to get to that repository before Ranrok does.",
  "playermale_35594": "So the repository is safe from Ranrok for now.",
  "playermale_35595": "[[Was there anything else in the student's report?]] I'd be interested to know what else the student discovered.",
  "playermale_35597": "[[Centaurs are known for being wise.]] I suppose they are known for having an air of omniscience.",
  "playermale_35598": "[[Centaurs don't know any more than the rest of us.]] I hope they can tell we're sincere but, Poppy, centaurs are just –centaurs. They can't read your mind any better than I could.",
  "playermale_35601": "[[I'll get started.]] Of course. I'll start to search for those barricades.",
  "playermale_35602": "[[I'm interested in seeing that student report.]] I'd be interested to know what else the student discovered.",
  "playermale_35603": "[[Where do you think these diary pages came from?]] Do you think the pages were left here on purpose?",
  "playermale_35604": "Now, here's a new challenge.",
  "playermale_35605": "Rickety bone bridge complete.",
  "playermale_35606": "I need to find a safe way across.",
  "playermale_35607": "Perhaps moving piles of bones toward the centre will help.",
  "playermale_35608": "I believe I need to use <i>Accio</i> on the pile of bones.",
  "playermale_35609": "Sebastian! The relic. Look.",
  "playermale_35610": "<i>Imperio</i>. It was the only way to get out of here without a fight.",
  "playermale_35611": "We agreed on what was needed, Sebastian. You have my word.",
  "playermale_35612": "I did. But with his consent, Sebastian. It may seem an irrelevant difference, but it is a difference.",
  "playermale_35615": "[[That sounds wonderful.]] What a nice idea, Arn. I wish you luck with it.",
  "playermale_35616": "[[That's a little excessive.]] I'm not sure that's worthy of a painting.",
  "playermale_35617": "[[What 'crest' are you sending to Anne?]] What did you mean you'd send Anne a 'crest' so that she'd know to meet you?",
  "playermale_35618": "Fig had a Portkey that led us there after the dragon attack. It's a bit of a long story, and Fig had asked that I not speak of it yet.",
  "playermale_35619": "And Ranrok's after something I found at Gringotts.",
  "playermale_35620": "Fig had a Portkey that led us there after the dragon attack. It's a bit of a long story, and Fig's asked that I not speak of it yet.",
  "playermale_35621": "We'll simply be honest with them about what we're trying to do. They'll have to help us, won't they?",
  "playermale_35622": "Didn't the journal say 'The key to finding the Snidgets lies in the moonlight'?",
  "playermale_35623": "Professor, could you spare a moment?",
  "playermale_35624": "[[I'm interested in goblin rebellions.]]I'm interested in the goblin rebellions of the past.",
  "playermale_35625": "[[Never mind.]]Apologies, Professor. Perhaps later.",
  "playermale_35626": "[[Hogsmeade was attacked.]]But Hogsmeade was just attacked, Professor.",
  "playermale_35627": "[[Thank you for your time.]]Thank you for your time, Professor Binns.",
  "playermale_35628": "[[That's very interesting.]]Please go on.",
  "playermale_35629": "[[I need to go now.]]Ah, well, it appears I'm out of time. Thank you, Professor.",
  "playermale_35630": "[[Yes, absolutely.]]Oh, oh yes, Professor. Please continue.",
  "playermale_35631": "[[I'm afraid not. Thank you for your time.]]Not exactly, Professor. But I must be on my way.",
  "playermale_35633": "[[I would love to hear more.]]If you would be so kind, Professor Binns.",
  "playermale_35634": "[[I have the information I needed.]]On the contrary, you've been most helpful. Goodbye.",
  "playermale_35637": "I find your lectures quite engaging, sir. Thank you for sharing your vast knowledge.",
  "playermale_35639": "[[Very well. I shall leave you to it.]] Good luck with Ominis. Until we meet again.",
  "playermale_35644": "There's Sebastian.",
  "playermale_35645": "I need to find a way up that ledge.",
  "playermale_35646": "Perhaps I need to open the sarcophagi.",
  "playermale_35647": "I need to move the bones and make a bridge.",
  "playermale_35648": "I can't let him leave.",
  "playermale_35649": "'Control'? I had to fight Inferi all the way – ",
  "playermale_35652": "I'm afraid I don't follow.",
  "playermale_35653": "[[What sort of courses are these?]] Can you tell me more about these courses?",
  "playermale_35654": "Well, surrounding the moonstone with birds that can drive people mad would certainly be one way to keep it safe.",
  "playermale_35655": "I don't know, I've been listening to them for a while now and I'm starting to lose my mind.",
  "playermale_35656": "[[Sounds worth a try, Mr Weekes.]] That sounds intriguing – I'll see what I can do.",
  "playermale_35657": "[[You took Madam Kogawa's class?]] Sounds as though you took Kogawa's class.",
  "playermale_35658": "[[How did your passion for brooms begin?]] How long have you had a passion for brooms?",
  "playermale_35661": "[[I can't believe you didn't tell me.]] Why didn't you tell me this before? After all our time together?",
  "playermale_35662": "[[Thank you for trusting me.]] I'm glad you told me.",
  "playermale_35663": "If the demand for potions is as high as you say, have you considered being easier to work with? Perhaps combining your recipes and skills?",
  "playermale_35664": "[[I'd rather not.]] I'd rather not, but if you insist, so be it.",
  "playermale_35665": "[[May I ask you about the letters in the box?]] I wondered about some of the letters in the box.",
  "playermale_35666": "[[Were you on the Quidditch team?]] One of the letters mentions Quidditch practice. Did you play?",
  "playermale_35667": "[[Is 'Mirabel' Professor Garlick?]] I saw a letter from someone named 'Mirabel.' Is that Professor Garlick?",
  "playermale_35668": "[[Are Mrs Sprottle and you as close as you seem?]] I spotted a letter from you to Mrs Sprottle. You two seem to have a lot of fun together.",
  "playermale_35669": "Ranrok's Loyalists – just ahead. Should I take them by force or be discreet?",
  "playermale_35670": "Yes, Professor. Of course.",
  "playermale_35673": "Hello, Adelaide. I received your owl –",
  "playermale_35674": "Adelaide Oakes, isn't it? I received your owl –",
  "playermale_35675": "Hello, Adelaide. You've still not heard from your uncle?",
  "playermale_35676": "[[I would be worried.]] I think you're right to be concerned, Adelaide. Your uncle may be in trouble.",
  "playermale_35677": "[[I think you're overreacting.]] I'm not convinced you need to worry. Perhaps your uncle's been delayed. And surely he can take care of himself.",
  "playermale_35679": "[[Can you tell me more about your uncle's business with goblins?]] Has your uncle traded with many goblins?",
  "playermale_35681": "I think I'll just have a look around for now.",
  "playermale_35687": "(ahem) Attention, students. I hereby decree that the Great Hall be forthwith decorated in the noble banners of Gryffindor. I shall be taking no questions at this time. Or ever.",
  "playermale_35688": "(ahem) Attention, students. I hereby decree that the Great Hall be forthwith decorated in the stunning banners of Slytherin. I shall be taking no questions at this time. Or ever.",
  "playermale_35689": "(ahem) Attention, students. I hereby decree that the Great Hall be forthwith decorated in the dignified banners of Hufflepuff. I shall be taking no questions at this time. Or ever.",
  "playermale_35690": "(ahem) Attention, students. I hereby decree that the Great Hall be forthwith decorated in the elegant banners of Ravenclaw. I shall be taking no questions at this time. Or ever.",
  "playermale_35692": "It does, somewhat. But, at the moment, I'm more concerned about what else you heard the poachers are up to.",
  "playermale_35693": "Adelaide mentioned her uncle's camp may be near Brocburrow – past the river.",
  "playermale_35694": "I heard the Ashwinders were causing trouble around here.",
  "playermale_35695": "Mr Oakes's trade journal.",
  "playermale_35696": "What will we find in here?",
  "playermale_35697": "It's all right, Mr Oakes. I've dealt with these goblins before.",
  "playermale_35698": "[[What did you overhear?]] You mentioned you overhead things?",
  "playermale_35699": "[[Glad I was able to help.]] I'm grateful I was able to help you, Mr Oakes. Adelaide thinks the world of you.",
  "playermale_35700": "A boiler door. How to open it?",
  "playermale_35701": "A furnace. Could be promising.",
  "playermale_35702": "I should try lighting that furnace. It must be connected to the boiler door.",
  "playermale_35703": "Fortunately, I've already found your wand, Mr Oakes.",
  "playermale_35704": "I need to find Mr Oakes's wand. Where could it be?",
  "playermale_35705": "[[Do you speak Gobbledegook?]] Am I right that you speak Gobbledegook?",
  "playermale_35706": "What do you sell?",
  "playermale_35707": "I've already caught at least one of them. I wasn't sure what they were for.",
  "playermale_35708": "I actually found them all and opened the chest.",
  "playermale_35709": "I found a rather interesting costume.",
  "playermale_35710": "Hello, Nellie. Actually, I've found all of the keys and opened my house chest.",
  "playermale_35714": "[[Thank you.]]It was a pleasure doing business with you, Mr Pippin.",
  "playermale_35715": "[[I'd like an additional fee.]] Delivering those potions was a bit more work than I'd expected. I'd like an additional fee.",
  "playermale_35716": "By the way, I found this book of potion recipes in Keenbridge. Might it be useful to you?",
  "playermale_35718": "I found a rather interesting costume.",
  "playermale_35732": "This must be the cellar. Now, to find that Venomous Tentacula.",
  "playermale_35733": "[[She's safer with me.]] I think Biscuit will be safer with me, Garnuff.",
  "playermale_35734": "[[I'll leave her with you.]] If you're certain you can keep her safe, I suppose I can leave her with you.",
  "playermale_35735": "[[I'm afraid I must.]] Biscuit is clearly not safe with you and I know how to protect her.",
  "playermale_35736": "That chest looks interesting.",
  "playermale_35740": "I ought to look into this thievery business for Mr Haggarty once night falls.",
  "playermale_35741": "Now that it's night, I ought to look into this thievery business for Mr Haggarty.",
  "playermale_35742": "A pile of gold? I must be on the right track. It looks as if the thief took more than they could carry.",
  "playermale_35743": "More gold. I must be getting closer.",
  "playermale_35744": "A Niffler? It wasn't Catrin Haggarty after all.",
  "playermale_35745": "That must be the Haggarty family heirloom!",
  "playermale_35746": "[[You can have it back – for a price.]] I found your heirloom and I'll give it back to you – for a price.",
  "playermale_35747": "I take it you're a fan.",
  "playermale_35748": "[[We all need a bit of luck.]] I know that feeling. Some things are simply out of our control.",
  "playermale_35749": "[[Surely skill could overcome bad luck.]] If you were that good, I can't believe a 'bit of bad luck' could end your entire Quidditch career.",
  "playermale_35750": "[[I'm not sure what that is.]] What is Felix Felicis? A potion?",
  "playermale_35751": "[[That's awful.]] Liquid Luck? That's illegal, isn't it?",
  "playermale_35752": "What happened to Asuka? Did she burn her broom as well?",
  "playermale_35753": "You didn't report her? Tell them what she'd done?",
  "playermale_35754": "Thank you, Professor. I shall remember what you've told me.",
  "playermale_35759": "[[I'm glad to have helped.]] It was nothing at all, Adelaide. I'm just glad your uncle's safe.",
  "playermale_35760": "[[Anything more to those owls?]] Any other pertinent details about those owls?",
  "playermale_35761": "Hello. Do you have anything for sale?",
  "playermale_35762": "Something to consider. Thank you for your help, Mr Babcocke.",
  "playermale_35763": "[[I like to explore.]] Just exploring the countryside a bit.",
  "playermale_35764": "[[I needed to get away from the castle.]] Needed a little rest from classes. Can't stay in the castle all the time.",
  "playermale_35765": "Hello. Do you have anything for sale?",
  "playermale_35766": "Pleasure to meet you, Miss Treadwell.",
  "playermale_35767": "Are you related to Nora Treadwell?",
  "playermale_35769": "[[I'm fascinated by Merlin.]] Merlin was such a fascinating person. You wife's work sounds intriguing.",
  "playermale_35770": "[[I don't know much about Merlin.]] I don't know much about Merlin, if I'm honest. But your wife's work sounds intriguing.",
  "playermale_35772": "I actually met her, and she introduced me to her work. I'm involved in it now as well.",
  "playermale_35773": "Impressive. I'd like to meet her one day.",
  "playermale_35774": "Hello. Do you have anything for sale?",
  "playermale_35775": "Thank you, Mr Prakash. Best of luck to you and your father.",
  "playermale_35776": "Is that right? How long have you been in business?",
  "playermale_35777": "[[I'm sorry to hear that.]] Oh, that's a shame. I'm sorry about your father.",
  "playermale_35778": "[[Congratulations on your success.]] Congratulations on your many years of success – to you and your father.",
  "playermale_35779": "He wanted me to have a safe place to practise some spells – to try and catch up to the other fifth-years. He didn't think you'd mind.",
  "playermale_35780": "Sebastian simply wanted me to have a safe place to practise some spells – to try and catch up to the other fifth-years. He didn't think you'd mind.",
  "playermale_35781": "Don't tell me he's still going on about – what was it – a 'scriptorium'?",
  "playermale_35782": "Wait. You've never been inside?",
  "playermale_35783": "[[Aren't you curious about what's inside?]] I'm sorry about your aunt. Don't you want to find out what happened to her?",
  "playermale_35784": "[[I understand your caution.]] That is a bit unnerving. I suppose even if it might lead to answers about what happened to your aunt, it does pose a risk.",
  "playermale_35785": "[[Very well. I'll do it.]] Very well. You've convinced me.",
  "playermale_35786": "[[I'll find another way.]] Very well. I'll see what I can do.",
  "playermale_35787": "[[Can you tell me about your customers?]] You mentioned that more and more customers are trying to stay out of sight. Why?",
  "playermale_35788": "I wonder if I need to place lanterns to open these doors.",
  "playermale_35789": "[[If it is, she doesn't deserve it back.]] You should keep it. She doesn't deserve to have it.",
  "playermale_35790": "[[I didn't realise.]] Oh, I had no idea it was hers.",
  "playermale_35792": "Go on.",
  "playermale_35793": "[[Why am I the right person for this?]] Why do you need me to report to you on this broom flight?",
  "playermale_35796": "We have some spectators. These trials must be popular.",
  "playermale_35797": "[[Who has doubted you?]] Why would anyone doubt your ability to upgrade brooms?",
  "playermale_35799": "[[Can you tell me more about the Irondale course?]] What more can you tell me about the next course?",
  "playermale_35800": "So you did create them.",
  "playermale_35801": "I am. At the request of Mr Moon. I received your owl. On your stationery.",
  "playermale_35802": "[[My apologies.]] Sounds as if Mr Moon deserved what he got. But perhaps it's time you both moved on.",
  "playermale_35803": "[[You're no better than Mr Moon.]] The statues are a form of bullying. You're no better than him. Perhaps it's time you both moved on.",
  "playermale_35804": "And you think this 'relic' might be able to save Anne.",
  "playermale_35805": "What a horrible story.",
  "playermale_35806": "I didn't. I promise.",
  "playermale_35807": "Thank you, Professor.",
  "playermale_35808": "Thank you, Professor. I – ",
  "playermale_35809": "How did you – ?",
  "playermale_35810": "I'm certain I don't know what – ",
  "playermale_35812": "He also said he cannot excuse the use of Dark Magic in any form. And that if he hears of either of us using it, he'll go straight to Professor Black.",
  "playermale_35813": "Of course.",
  "playermale_35814": "Time? For what?",
  "playermale_35815": "I need to find a way into the gatehouse to open the gate for Natty.",
  "playermale_35816": "This box should help me reach the ledge.",
  "playermale_35817": "How can I raise the box?",
  "playermale_35818": "Perhaps I should use <i>Levioso</i> to lift the box and then climb on top of it.",
  "playermale_35819": "[[He belongs with you.]] I wouldn't keep your Rococo. He needs to be home with you.",
  "playermale_35820": "Mr Oakes was lucky. Ranrok's lot would never have freed him.",
  "playermale_35821": "Hm – I may have more luck higher up in the keep.",
  "playermale_35822": "A ladder – that's what I need.",
  "playermale_35823": "Hello, Mr Moon.",
  "playermale_35824": "I'm sorry to say, I haven't found any more.",
  "playermale_35825": "[[I'll keep looking.]] I'll keep an eye out for more Demiguise statues and see if I can bring you more moons.",

  "playermale_35829": "[[I'll keep looking.]] I'll keep an eye out for more Demiguise statues and see if I can bring you more moons.",

  "playermale_35831": "What if the choice wasn't yours? You wouldn't be to blame for what happens.",
  "playermale_35832": "[[Never mind.]] Now that you say it out loud, it sounds absurd. But I have another idea.",
  "playermale_35833": "I'm willing to learn to cast it, Ominis. It may be the only way. But I won't do it unless you agree.",
  "playermale_35834": "I know how to cast it. Sebastian taught me. But I won't do it unless you agree.",
  "playermale_35836": "I am suggesting we negotiate.",

  "playermale_35842": "Mr Sallow! Stop!",
  "playermale_35843": "It was brave, Sebastian. You clearly care more about Anne than your uncle ever did.",
  "playermale_35844": "You did. I would have done the same – if I knew how.",
  "playermale_35845": "[[Yes please.]] No time like the present.",
  "playermale_35846": "[[Now is not the time.]] Thank you, Sebastian, but perhaps now is not the time.",

  "playermale_35848": "[[I'm not sure.]] I don't know what to do, Sebastian.",
  "playermale_35849": "[[Very well. I'll talk to him.]] Don't worry, Sebastian. I shall speak with Ominis.",
  "playermale_35850": "He clearly regrets everything. He's not going to do anything like this again.",
  "playermale_35851": "But we also need to think about Anne. She's lost her health – now she's lost her uncle. Do you really want to take her brother away from her too?",
  "playermale_35852": "Thank you, Ominis. You're a good friend.",
  "playermale_35853": "We've tried to justify his actions every step of the way. But this has gone too far. It has to stop.",

  "playermale_35863": "Perhaps I'll find more Horklumps while I'm there.",
  "playermale_35864": "Best of luck with your potions, Mr Pippin.",
  "playermale_35865": "What was it you needed my help with, Samantha?",
  "playermale_35866": "I need to find the tomb near Brocburrow and place Samantha's family crest on a sarcophagus there.",
  "playermale_35867": "Samantha will be glad to hear that the crest has been returned. I certainly hope it reverses the curse.",

  "playermale_35869": "[[Strong competition?]] 'Strong competition'? Could that have been a compliment, Imelda?",

  "playermale_35945": "I will say that it tended to drift a bit to the left on certain turns. Heard a slight 'swoosh' when I dipped.",

  "playermale_35971": "Sirona has been a good friend to me as well. In fact, I retrieved a box of letters from Mrs Sprottle for her.",

  "playermale_35982": "[[I know what you mean.]] I never thought things would end this way. I hope we did the right thing.",
  "playermale_35983": "[[He deserves to be punished.]] Sebastian brought all of this on himself. We tried and tried to stop him.",
  "playermale_35984": "Were you able to tell Sebastian about Rookwood cursing Anne?",
  "playermale_35985": "I'm glad to hear it. She deserves peace.",
  "playermale_35986": "Sebastian – there's something you should know. It's to do with Victor Rookwood.",

  "playermale_36003": "Yes, Professor.",

  "playermale_36013": "[[How could you leave your home?]] Wasn't it difficult to leave your home?",
  "playermale_36014": "[[I understand wanting to leave your past.]] I suppose I can understand wanting to move on from all that you went through with the Tengu.",
  "playermale_36015": "What do we have here?",
  "playermale_36016": "[[What else can you share about brooms?]]Do you mind sharing more about your brooms?",
  "playermale_36017": "Professor, do you have a moment?",
  "playermale_36018": "I see. Natty told me that you and she moved here from Uganda, where she had attended Uagadou.",
  "playermale_36019": "Professor, how did you come to teach Divination?",
  "playermale_36020": "[[How did you come to teach Divination?]]I was wondering how you decided to teach Divination?",
  "playermale_36021": "Of course, Professor.",
  "playermale_36022": "[[Never mind.]]I'm sorry. It seems now isn't the best time after all.",
  "playermale_36023": "[[I find it all fascinating.]]I find it truly intriguing, even if I don't fully understand it.",
  "playermale_36024": "[[It seems – hard to believe.]]I'm not sure I believe that one can really see the future.",
  "playermale_36034": "Professor, may I have a moment of your time?",

  "playermale_36036": "[[How did you and Natty end up at Hogwarts?]]Professor, could you tell me how you and Natty ended up at Hogwarts?",
  "playermale_36037": "[[Never mind.]]Apologies, Professor. Perhaps another time.",
  "playermale_36038": "[[I'm not surprised.]]Professor Weasley seems quite knowledgeable, so I'm not surprised to hear that she'd do that sort of thing.",
  "playermale_36039": "Natty has spoken of your move. She was quite kind to me my first day here, in Charms.",
  "playermale_36040": "You knew Professor Weasley when you were in Uganda?",
  "playermale_36041": "I see.",
  "playermale_36042": "[[You can't be serious.]]I confess that I'm surprised to hear Professor Weasley would ever do that sort of thing.",
  "playermale_36043": "Professor, might I have a moment?",
  "playermale_36044": "Professor, what inspired your interest in magical beasts?",
  "playermale_36045": "[[Why are you interested in magical beasts?]]I was wondering what inspired your interest in magical beasts.",
  "playermale_36046": "Of course, Professor. When did your path become clear?",
  "playermale_36047": "[[Possibly. I find magical beasts fascinating.]]I haven't decided quite yet, but I do find magical beasts fascinating.",
  "playermale_36048": "[[I am not.]]Truthfully, I am not. But I am interested to know why you chose this path for yourself.",

  "playermale_36059": "[[How unfortunate.]] Your poor sister. What an unfortunate situation for your family.",

  "playermale_36091": "[[I can't wait to explore.]] I'm looking forward to exploring Hogwarts and the world beyond the castle and grounds.",
  "playermale_36092": "[[Daring.]] A sense of adventure? I like to think that I'm not afraid of anything.",
  "playermale_36093": "[[Curiosity.]] A desire to learn? I do enjoy a good puzzle. And I believe I have a ready mind.",
  "playermale_36094": "[[Loyalty.]] A sense of loyalty? I believe myself to be a true friend. I know I value that trait in others.",
  "playermale_36095": "[[Ambition.]] Is it ambition? I may seem single-minded, but it is important to go after what you want from life.",

  "playermale_36099": "Actually, that's all I wanted to know.",
  "playermale_36100": "Hmm. Only two lanterns – but three spots. Perhaps I should move them around to open the door and build the platform.",
  "playermale_36101": "Perhaps I should pull the lantern into this room to cause the room to rotate again.",
  "playermale_36103": "Is that how he found this place?",
  "playermale_36104": "Why can I see the weapon but not the statue that's wielding it?",
  "playermale_36105": "Perhaps I need to be on the same side of the arch as the statue to see him.",
  "playermale_36106": "Hard to say from up here. Let's get a better lay of the land.",
  "playermale_36107": "Are those dragons?",

  "playermale_36182": "Eight legs is simply too many.",
  "playermale_36183": "Ugh. Shame you're so foul.",
  "playermale_36184": "Not my fault you're a deadly great spider.",
  "playermale_36185": "Cursed fiends.",
  "playermale_36186": "There's a victory that came none too soon. Ugh.",
  "playermale_36187": "Rest easy, my large friend.",
  "playermale_36188": "One less foul hulking brute.",
  "playermale_36189": "Should think they felt that in London.",
  "playermale_36190": "That was a close one.",
  "playermale_36191": "Now here's a welcoming sight.",
  "playermale_36192": "I hope I look this good when I'm nine hundred years old.",
  "playermale_36193": "And the whole world awaits.",
  "playermale_36194": "Where to next?",
  "playermale_36195": "I'll be back here soon enough.",
  "playermale_36196": "Who'd think an enormous castle could feel like home?",
  "playermale_36197": "Back to Hogwarts. Wonder if they've missed me?",
  "playermale_36198": "Never thought I'd feel so comforted to see this place.",
  "playermale_36199": "This place stinks of Ranrok and his cronies.",
  "playermale_36200": "There could be goblin Loyalists in here.",
  "playermale_36201": "Wonder if Ranrok and his crew are in there?",
  "playermale_36202": "Could be some of Ranrok's Loyalists in there. Best be careful.",
  "playermale_36203": "This mine could be hiding a secret – Ranrok and his Loyalists.",
  "playermale_36204": "Mine now, Demiguise.",
  "playermale_36205": "What do we have here? A Demiguise.",
  "playermale_36206": "Here's one of those tables Professor Shah mentioned.",
  "playermale_36207": "Knowing Amit, he's likely studied here.",
  "playermale_36208": "An Astronomy Table. Should prove useful once the sun's down.",
  "playermale_36209": "Likely this Astronomy Table will be best used when it's dark.",
  "playermale_36210": "Perhaps not the best place to be caught alone.",
  "playermale_36211": "This looks like trouble.",
  "playermale_36212": "Goodness. Not a party to attend by myself.",
  "playermale_36213": "I don't like the looks of that encampment.",
  "playermale_36214": "Trouble's brewing, and I'm without my friends.",
  "playermale_36215": "Hm. Not the best place for an unaccompanied student.",
  "playermale_36216": "Glad I was never locked up here.",
  "playermale_36217": "What went on here, I wonder?",
  "playermale_36218": "Stone walls do a prison make, sometimes.",
  "playermale_36219": "Now here's a sad looking place.",
  "playermale_36220": "This castle's hiding all sorts of secrets.",
  "playermale_36221": "There's no telling what lies in wait for me in there.",
  "playermale_36222": "Wonder if I'm safe to explore in there.",
  "playermale_36223": "Mysterious and a bit unsettling. What to do?",
  "playermale_36224": "Looks rather dark in there. Never stopped me before.",
  "playermale_36225": "Who lived here, I wonder?",
  "playermale_36226": "Abandoned long ago no doubt.",
  "playermale_36227": "This place has seen better days.",
  "playermale_36228": "A castle. Must have been quite stately in its time.",
  "playermale_36229": "These rocks have seen better days.",
  "playermale_36230": "Could it be? A Merlin Trial?",
  "playermale_36231": "I know a Merlin Trial when I see one.",
  "playermale_36232": "Oho, here's a pleasant surprise.",
  "playermale_36233": "Let's see what's up your sleeve this time, Merlin.",
  "playermale_36234": "I know what that means. Merlin Trial.",
  "playermale_36235": "What do you have in store for me this time?",
  "playermale_36236": "Hm. Seems a pleasant enough little place.",
  "playermale_36237": "Wonder who lives here?",
  "playermale_36238": "Not sure how I'd fare in a little place like this.",
  "playermale_36239": "It's like a place right out of a story book.",
  "playermale_36240": "Seems I'm ill-prepared.",
  "playermale_36241": "Hm. Out of Wiggenweld Potions.",
  "playermale_36242": "Never good to be caught with no Wiggenweld Potion.",
  "playermale_36243": "Ugh. Empty.",
  "playermale_36244": "Professor Sharp'll never let me live this down.",
  "playermale_36245": "Nothing to identify, for now at least.",
  "playermale_36246": "This will be more useful when I have something to identify.",
  "playermale_36247": "I don't have anything for this at the moment.",
  "playermale_36248": "This looks intriguing.",
  "playermale_36249": "I should investigate.",
  "playermale_36250": "This could prove dangerous if I'm not careful.",
  "playermale_36251": "Nobody'll believe I defeated an Ashwinder by myself.",
  "playermale_36252": "And no one to share in my victory.",
  "playermale_36253": "Wait till Sebastian hears about this. An Ashwinder.",
  "playermale_36254": "I did it. And an Ashwinder, no less.",
  "playermale_36255": "Shame nobody saw that.",
  "playermale_36256": "Sometimes it seems all roads lead to Hogsmeade.",
  "playermale_36257": "Hogsmeade, here I come.",
  "playermale_36258": "Does it get any more cosy than Hogsmeade?",
  "playermale_36259": "Merlin himself would be proud.",
  "playermale_36260": "These Merlin Trials won't get the best of me.",
  "playermale_36261": "That's that – settled.",
  "playermale_36262": "Not so tricky after all, Merlin.",
  "playermale_36263": "Not quite ready yet.",
  "playermale_36264": "Seems I'll need to wait.",
  "playermale_36265": "Hm. Too soon for that it seems.",
  "playermale_36266": "I need to wait.",
  "playermale_36267": "Hm. Hopefully not much longer.",
  "playermale_36268": "That's all for now. Don't go too far.",
  "playermale_36269": "I'll see you again soon enough, I'm sure.",
  "playermale_36270": "Mind yourself while I'm gone.",
  "playermale_36271": "You can have a rest now.",
  "playermale_36272": "Wow! Now to see things from above for a bit.",
  "playermale_36273": "This will be a welcome change.",
  "playermale_36274": "Nothing like a broom to feel free.",
  "playermale_36275": "Down to earth again.",
  "playermale_36276": "That's all the flying for now.",
  "playermale_36277": "And to think Muggles only use these for sweeping.",
  "playermale_36278": "No flying here, I see.",
  "playermale_36279": "Wait till the birds hear about the flying ban.",
  "playermale_36280": "No use trying to fly here.",
  "playermale_36281": "Not the best idea to fly around here.",
  "playermale_36282": "Time to change course.",
  "playermale_36283": "I'll need to dismount if I keep going that way.",
  "playermale_36284": "No flying allowed here.",
  "playermale_36285": "This is no place for flying.",
  "playermale_36286": "Seems I can't fly here. Wonder whose decision that was.",
  "playermale_36287": "What could this be?",
  "playermale_36288": "Here's an odd find.",
  "playermale_36289": "Hm, what's this?",
  "playermale_36290": "Whatever this is, it may prove useful.",
  "playermale_36291": "This might be something to keep.",
  "playermale_36292": "I know a den of beasts when I smell one.",
  "playermale_36293": "Here's hoping the residents aren't too ferocious.",
  "playermale_36294": "Hopefully they've had a good meal.",
  "playermale_36295": "Ah, my very own Room of Requirement.",
  "playermale_36296": "What do I require this time, o wondrous space?",
  "playermale_36297": "Who says wishes don't come true.",
  "playermale_36298": "The most magical place in all of Hogwarts.",
  "playermale_36299": "Time to see what new secrets await.",
  "playermale_36300": "What a wonderful place.",
  "playermale_36301": "Simply marvellous.",
  "playermale_36302": "Who could wish to see anything more incredible.",
  "playermale_36303": "I've run out of plants. Curses.",
  "playermale_36304": "Not a single plant to my name.",
  "playermale_36305": "It would have been nice to have some plants on hand  – but I have nothing.",
  "playermale_36306": "Here's a lost page.",
  "playermale_36307": "My Field Guide's going to be glad to see this.",
  "playermale_36308": "Another page.",
  "playermale_36309": "The Field Guide's getting a bit more complete.",
  "playermale_36310": "One page at a time.",
  "playermale_36311": "I know what this is. A page for my Field Guide.",
  "playermale_36312": "And one for you, Professor Weasley.",
  "playermale_36313": "I'll put you back where you belong. In my Field Guide.",
  "playermale_36314": "Another page for my Field Guide. Brilliant.",
  "playermale_36315": "That's no ordinary sheet of paper.",
  "playermale_36316": "Here's a page that's come out of my Field Guide.",
  "playermale_36317": "You'll be back in my Field Guide in no time.",
  "playermale_36318": "One more page for my Field Guide. Very good.",
  "playermale_36319": "You're not lost any more, little page.",
  "playermale_36320": "Into my Field Guide with you.",
  "playermale_36321": "I know just where to put you. In my Field Guide.",
  "playermale_36322": "It's not a complete guide without you.",
  "playermale_36323": "My collection of Field Guide Pages is coming along.",
  "playermale_36324": "A page. To my Field Guide.",
  "playermale_36325": "I've found another page for my Field Guide.",
  "playermale_36326": "A flying key!",
  "playermale_36327": "Is that one of those keys?",
  "playermale_36328": "I see you, little flying key.",
  "playermale_36329": "Excellent. Shan't mention this to the prefects.",
  "playermale_36330": "That house chest will be open in no time.",
  "playermale_36331": "I know where this goes. The house chest.",
  "playermale_36332": "Ruins. What mysteries lie beyond your walls, I wonder?",
  "playermale_36333": "How old must those ruins be?",
  "playermale_36334": "Whoever built you didn't account for weather.",
  "playermale_36335": "I suppose that's off limits.",
  "playermale_36336": "I'd better not let Madam Scribner see me trying to get in here.",
  "playermale_36337": "I still have the key.",
  "playermale_36338": "The key will help me get back in here.",
  "playermale_36339": "Penny. Please stop holding your breath.  Tell me what's going on.",
  "playermale_36340": "But, how can you be forbidden from telling me what's going on? I purchased this shop. I – ",
  "playermale_36341": "And, according to the house-elf that came with the shop, she has done this sort of thing before. Repeatedly.",
  "playermale_36342": "Penny, I have what I hope will be good news. Officer Singer confirmed that ownership of the shop has now transferred to me.",
  "playermale_36343": "I enjoyed that.",
  "playermale_36344": "Has this been under the Headmaster's nose all this time?",
  "playermale_36346": "It seems that a lot of beasts have been more aggressive than usual lately.",
  "playermale_36348": "They can't see me at all. I can get closer to them.",
  "playermale_36349": "That's the way forward.",
  "playermale_36350": "That's where I need to go, but I need to find a way past them.",
  "playermale_36351": "(belch)",
  "playermale_36352": "(belch)",
  "playermale_36353": "(belch)",
  "playermale_36354": "Glad I could be of help. And I look forward to visiting your shop the next time I'm in Aranshire.",

  "PoppySweeting_10007": "I also overheard one of them bragging about all the gold they're making. At the expense of innocent creatures, undoubtedly.",
  "PoppySweeting_10008": "The poachers' best kept secret apparently. The name came up twice, but they never went into detail.",
  "PoppySweeting_10055": "No creatures, though. So what are they doing out here?",
  "PoppySweeting_10058": "I'll let you know what I find.",
  "PoppySweeting_10059": "It's not like her to forget.",
  "PoppySweeting_10061": "If that's all right. I want to see how she's faring if she had a collar on – and she's likely frantic about her egg.",
  "PoppySweeting_10063": "Of course. Are you ready to leave?",
  "PoppySweeting_10064": "Let's go and knock on a dragon's door then. Well,  assuming she's home.",
  "PoppySweeting_10065": "Of course.",
  "PoppySweeting_10066": "Quiet. What was that?",
  "PoppySweeting_10067": "Still taking it all in?",
  "PoppySweeting_10069": "I suppose a few more minutes can't hurt.",
  "PoppySweeting_10070": "I wonder how long she lived here. Or where she'll go now.",
  "PoppySweeting_10071": "I'm ready whenever you are.",
  "PoppySweeting_10215": "There she is – above us – she did make it home safely.",
  "PoppySweeting_10239": "Oh, and one more thing – let's not agitate her; goodness knows she's been through enough already.",
  "PoppySweeting_10248": "No. It belongs to her. Keeping it would make me just as bad as the poachers.",
  "PoppySweeting_10264": "Hebrideans can be aggressive, but they're also clever. She caught on quickly enough when you showed her how to escape the tent.",
  "PoppySweeting_10277": "Please, we were hoping to speak with you –",
  "PoppySweeting_10279": "We'll need to be careful in how we approach them. Tensions with them are high.",
  "PoppySweeting_10302": "No, never. We're here because we need your help –",
  "PoppySweeting_10304": "Her nest will likely be in the heart of her den, which she will be keeping guard over. It might also be more charred than anywhere else, I imagine.",
  "PoppySweeting_10316": "We don't speak. Or rather, they don't speak to me. Last I heard, they were in Borneo trying to make their fortunes there: Acromantulas.",
  "PoppySweeting_10320": "You want us to – ?",
  "PoppySweeting_10323": "Thank you, Dorran – for helping us to find them – and to fight for them.",
  "PoppySweeting_10341": "Poor thing must be worried sick, wondering what happened to her egg.",
  "PoppySweeting_10344": "She's breathtaking!",
  "PoppySweeting_10379": "Seeing you is like having my own, personal Draught of Peace.",
  "PoppySweeting_10380": "Ah – how lovely to see you.",
  "PoppySweeting_10381": "Good to see you.",
  "PoppySweeting_10382": "I do hope you're doing well.",
  "PoppySweeting_10383": "I hope things are going well for you.",
  "PoppySweeting_10384": "Hello. Nice to see you.",
  "PoppySweeting_10385": "Pleasure to see you.",
  "PoppySweeting_10418": "I daresay you're not much of a challenge.",
  "PoppySweeting_10419": "I shan't cower to you!",
  "PoppySweeting_10420": "There are so many things I'd rather do with my time.",
  "PoppySweeting_10421": "That was rather well done, if I do say so myself.",
  "PoppySweeting_10422": "Go on, say it – I was magnificent.",
  "PoppySweeting_10423": "Oh, that's a brilliant idea.",
  "PoppySweeting_10424": "Yes. A more hushed approach is likely wise.",
  "PoppySweeting_10447": "Enemies – I don't like the look of this.",
  "PoppySweeting_10448": "Up ahead – we should be careful.",
  "PoppySweeting_10449": "Oh dear, you poor thing – you seem unwell.",
  "PoppySweeting_10450": "Don't worry – I shan't let you perish.",
  "PoppySweeting_10451": "There. That should do it.",
  "PoppySweeting_10463": "May I suggest we not be here?",
  "PoppySweeting_10464": "I'm not at all comfortable with this.",
  "PoppySweeting_10466": "Such skill.",
  "PoppySweeting_10476": "I am sorry to see you behave so wickedly.",
  "PoppySweeting_10569": "Why would you do such a thing?",
  "PoppySweeting_10570": "A well won victory, I must say.",
  "PoppySweeting_10571": "That was remarkable.",
  "PoppySweeting_10580": "Pity – she must have been starved to pick off a Graphorn.",
  "PoppySweeting_10582": "Well, there's no turning back now – Remember, we don't want to hurt her.",
  "PoppySweeting_10585": "Look! Where the water's bubbling! How odd.",
  "PoppySweeting_10620": "I see the bridge wasn't spared her wrath either.",
  "PoppySweeting_10631": "Golden Snidgets are still alive and the poachers are after them.",
  "PoppySweeting_10662": "I only ever wanted to see them safe, which they are –",
  "PoppySweeting_10664": "Merlin – they're lovely –",
  "PoppySweeting_10665": "But what happens now? They can't care for themselves and surely once word gets out of their reappearance –",
  "PoppySweeting_10684": "They know that the key to finding them lies in the moonlight, but they don't know what that means – yet. Please, help us find the Snidgets before the poachers do.",
  "PoppySweeting_10693": "He's a clever one, Gerald. Knows you have food. You can give him some.",
  "PoppySweeting_10694": "Don't worry, he's not going to bite you. Isn't that right, Gerald?",
  "PoppySweeting_10695": "Just a quick brush. That's all he needs.",
  "PoppySweeting_10733": "It's just ahead.",
  "PoppySweeting_10734": "So? What did you think of Highwing?",
  "PoppySweeting_10735": "I suspected you two might get along.",
  "PoppySweeting_10746": "I'd hoped I would.",
  "PoppySweeting_10748": "You'll see. I promise you have nothing to fear.",
  "PoppySweeting_10772": "Go on. A bit of feed's the quickest way to his heart.",
  "PoppySweeting_10773": "Go on. You can't go wrong brushing him. It's the best part of his day.",
  "PoppySweeting_10774": "It's good for Gerald to have his hair brushed. Does wonders for his confidence.",
  "PoppySweeting_10784": "In fact, the Golden Snitch in Quidditch is based on the Snidget – which, barbarically, was actually used in the sport hundreds of years ago.",
  "PoppySweeting_10792": "This way. The Kneazles are over here.",
  "PoppySweeting_10793": "Hmm. The Kneazles really took to you. They know a good egg when they see one. As do I.",
  "PoppySweeting_10796": "Watch out! It's her domain; she'll make sure we know it.",
  "PoppySweeting_10797": "Not a warm welcome.",
  "PoppySweeting_10798": "She's leaving! Quickly!",
  "PoppySweeting_10802": "Here we are. I do think this is where we'll find her. The terrain's typical of where the breed would nest.",
  "PoppySweeting_10804": "Shall we see if she's home? We only need to return her egg.",
  "PoppySweeting_10813": "Yes, Professor Howin.",
  "PoppySweeting_10814": "Hello, I'm Poppy – Poppy Sweeting.",
  "PoppySweeting_10816": "Don’t worry about Professor Howin’s speech, she overexaggerates sometimes. All the beasts in class are perfectly safe.",
  "PoppySweeting_10817": "Here, you can practise on Gerald.",
  "PoppySweeting_10818": "You can use my brush. Just be gentle. Oh, and think pleasant thoughts. I like to think it enriches his experience.",
  "PoppySweeting_10819": "Just keep an eye out for his tongue. (laughs)",
  "PoppySweeting_10820": "Uh, yes, Professor.",
  "PoppySweeting_10821": "Stand back.",
  "PoppySweeting_10822": "(exhales) Please meet Highwing! Isn't she just magnificent?",
  "PoppySweeting_10823": "Go on. Introduce yourself to her. But be careful, you must always show Hippogriffs the proper courtesy before you approach them.",
  "PoppySweeting_10831": "I think he might be hungry. Would you mind giving him some beast feed?",
  "PoppySweeting_10832": "That's lovely. I'm sure he feels much better.",
  "PoppySweeting_10841": "(whistle sound)",
  "PoppySweeting_10844": "What do you suppose the pellets taste like to Gerald? Pudding, I like to think.",
  "PoppySweeting_10845": "Those two don't belong anywhere near this class. Poachers-in-training. Persephone was onto them instantly.",
  "PoppySweeting_10846": "You did wonderfully with Gerald. You should be fine with a Kneazle.",
  "PoppySweeting_10847": "Trust me. I've never seen a Kneazle turn down a good brushing.",
  "PoppySweeting_10848": "Those food pellets are nutritious for Puffskeins and Kneazles.",
  "PoppySweeting_10849": "Hmm. Perhaps. Did you know that once you earn a Hippogriff's trust, they'll always be there for you?",
  "PoppySweeting_10855": "I suppose we could spare a moment. Very well.",
  "PoppySweeting_10856": "We shall. If we leave now we should make it there by nightfall.",
  "PoppySweeting_10857": "I have a feeling that was the idea.",
  "PoppySweeting_10858": "All right. I suppose I can map out the fastest route to the henge while you look around.",
  "PoppySweeting_10859": "Good. If we leave for the henge now we should make it by nightfall.",
  "PoppySweeting_10868": "Wonderful. If she sees us flying about she might take it as a sign of aggression – or food. We should stay on foot.",
  "PoppySweeting_10872": "Sir Affpuddle was friend to all, including beasts. I salute him for that.",
  "PoppySweeting_10877": "Come with me.",
  "PoppySweeting_10878": "I wouldn't take just anyone there – in fact, you're the first.",
  "PoppySweeting_10879": "As I said. We think alike. Pleasant surprise.",
  "PoppySweeting_10881": "Quite the weather we're having, don't you think?",
  "PoppySweeting_10884": "It really is much better if I just show you.",
  "PoppySweeting_10885": "Don't worry, we're nearly there.",
  "PoppySweeting_10891": "Searching for Grimbald Weft is so dull. I'd rather be in Beasts class.",
  "PoppySweeting_10895": "Psst. Psst. Over here.",
  "PoppySweeting_10896": "Hey, over here. Come on.",
  "PoppySweeting_10897": "I need to talk to you. Come here.",
  "PoppySweeting_10900": "If you collect the moonstone, I can make a quick drawing of the symbol for Dorran.",
  "PoppySweeting_10909": "You should do it.",
  "PoppySweeting_10919": "One of them contained theories about a secret hiding place of the Snidget, long thought to be extinct.",
  "PoppySweeting_10922": "Oh, good. It looks as if she wasn't collared like the other dragons.",
  "PoppySweeting_10926": "I wonder how many they brought to capture her. At least ten usually.",
  "PoppySweeting_10927": "I'll let you know as soon as I have a plan.",
  "PoppySweeting_10932": "I think that's it over there.",
  "PoppySweeting_10935": "Hm – I wonder how good her eyesight is – ?",
  "PoppySweeting_10937": "Over here!",
  "PoppySweeting_10938": "Up ahead! I think I spotted the nest!",
  "PoppySweeting_10939": "Look! Underneath her! I think we're close.",
  "PoppySweeting_10940": "I'd normally try, but we're well past that!",
  "PoppySweeting_10941": "I don't imagine the poachers fed her well, and from a distance we probably look exactly like sheep to her.",
  "PoppySweeting_10942": "Hebrideans love sheep.",
  "PoppySweeting_10944": "Let's hope it stays that way – at least until we've done what we came to do.",
  "PoppySweeting_10945": "Keep at it! We've just got to make it to the nest!",
  "PoppySweeting_10946": "Blimey! She's not letting us out of her sight!",
  "PoppySweeting_10950": "Get to that opening below her!",
  "PoppySweeting_10951": "If we can get to that entrance, we can get to the nest!",
  "PoppySweeting_10952": "The entrance to the nest is below her! Head for it!",
  "PoppySweeting_10955": "Good thing it's fixable.",
  "PoppySweeting_10956": "Now, if we just return her egg, we can hopefully make it out without too much fuss.",
  "PoppySweeting_10958": "Don't you people have anything better to do?",
  "PoppySweeting_10963": "You made it!",
  "PoppySweeting_10966": "I wonder if you'd go blind from staring directly at a moonstone.",
  "PoppySweeting_10975": "Are you finished exploring?",
  "PoppySweeting_10982": "Another obstacle.",
  "PoppySweeting_10984": "Fwoopers!",
  "PoppySweeting_10985": "We found it! It's like staring directly at the moon.",
  "PoppySweeting_10986": "I suppose we'll find out, won't we?",
  "PoppySweeting_10987": "Merlin! It's even more beautiful close up.",
  "PoppySweeting_10988": "This must be how the rumour about the cave started. The Fwooper's song is said to drive anyone who hears it mad.",
  "PoppySweeting_10989": "It's got to be here. I just know it.",
  "PoppySweeting_10990": "You read my mind.",
  "PoppySweeting_10991": "If the moonstone is here and so are Fwoopers, I wonder if it's being protected.",
  "PoppySweeting_11004": "I can do this, I can do this. They will want to help.",
  "PoppySweeting_11017": "She'll understand why we're here once she sees her egg. Then we can be finished with the poachers once and for all.",
  "PoppySweeting_11024": "It's another aggressive one!",
  "PoppySweeting_11027": "We should leave soon. The longer we stay, the more I want a Fwooper.",
  "PoppySweeting_11028": "Is the new Hufflepuff out of bed yet? Professor Weasley's waiting for them outside the common room.",
  "PoppySweeting_11029": "Every advantage over the poachers will help.",
  "PoppySweeting_11030": "No matter. I'm sure we can work out a way across.",
  "PoppySweeting_11031": "I was hoping we wouldn't have to do this again.",
  "PoppySweeting_11032": "Why am I not surprised?",
  "PoppySweeting_11033": "First the Fwoopers and now this.",
  "PoppySweeting_11035": "We need to find moths for those spinners.",
  "PoppySweeting_11037": "Would you consider yourself trustworthy?",
  "PoppySweeting_11038": "Because Kneazles can get a bit aggressive with people they sense may be shady.",
  "PoppySweeting_11040": "Hello, Professor Black.",
  "PoppySweeting_11042": "That was brilliant! And did you see how clever? She left us perfectly unharmed.",
  "PoppySweeting_11047": "Only until she saw her egg – at which point I thought she rather warmed to us.",
  "PoppySweeting_11056": "I wonder if Hippogriffs like knotgrass – ?",
  "PoppySweeting_11059": "How remarkable.",
  "PoppySweeting_11063": "Can you believe it? Actual Snidgets!",
  "PoppySweeting_11075": "You outdid yourself if I do say so myself.",
  "PoppySweeting_11076": "Remind me to keep on your good side.",
  "PoppySweeting_11077": "Remind me to bring you to every fight I'm ever in.",
  "PoppySweeting_11081": "Come on then! Do your worst!",
  "PoppySweeting_11082": "Fight like you mean it or don't fight at all!",
  "PoppySweeting_11083": "Is this the first time you've held a wand?",
  "PoppySweeting_11085": "Excellent work!",
  "PoppySweeting_11086": "Merlin! You're like an Auror-in-training.",
  "PoppySweeting_11087": "Expertly done!",
  "PoppySweeting_11091": "That's it – light-footed's the word.",
  "PoppySweeting_11092": "What I wouldn't give to be a Demiguise right now.",
  "PoppySweeting_11093": "One foot in front of the next and quiet as can be.",
  "PoppySweeting_11111": "Brilliant. We've got company.",
  "PoppySweeting_11112": "I smell trouble.",
  "PoppySweeting_11113": "Look alive. We're not alone.",
  "PoppySweeting_11114": "Stay strong!",
  "PoppySweeting_11115": "Chin up! You can get through this!",
  "PoppySweeting_11116": "I know it's hard, but try and hold on!",
  "PoppySweeting_11117": "Whatever you do, don't give up!",
  "PoppySweeting_11118": "It's alright. I can help.",
  "PoppySweeting_11119": "You'll feel better soon.",
  "PoppySweeting_11134": "Whatever you do, don't attract their attention.",
  "PoppySweeting_11135": "If we get caught this might not end well.",
  "PoppySweeting_11136": "If we're lucky they won't even know we're here.",
  "PoppySweeting_11158": "What did you just do? You could go to Azkaban!",
  "PoppySweeting_11171": "There was absolutely no need for that.",
  "PoppySweeting_11172": "That was entirely unnecessary.",
  "PoppySweeting_11267": "Don't worry. I can help you.",
  "PoppySweeting_11268": "It's alright. I'm here.",
  "PoppySweeting_11269": "So far so good.",
  "PoppySweeting_11270": "Please don't see us, please don't see us –",
  "PoppySweeting_11271": "We can do this.",
  "PoppySweeting_11313": "Don't look now, but we're about to make some friends.",
  "PoppySweeting_11314": "Oh goody. Undesirables.",
  "PoppySweeting_11315": "Uh-oh. Do you see what I see?",
  "PoppySweeting_11320": "You've got good flying technique. I'll give you that.",
  "PoppySweeting_11321": "Always going somewhere, that one.",
  "PoppySweeting_11323": "You learned to ride a Graphorn?",
  "PoppySweeting_11324": "A Graphorn. I should ask for an introduction.",
  "PoppySweeting_11325": "Well done!",
  "PoppySweeting_11326": "Hippogriffs only ever trust a few.",
  "PoppySweeting_11327": "I'm so glad you saved that little boy from the poachers. They're a terrible lot.",
  "PoppySweeting_11328": "I don't think I can ever thank you enough for saving Highwing. Truly.",
  "PoppySweeting_11329": "Did you really rescue a Gringotts Cursebreaker? The things you get up to.",
  "PoppySweeting_11330": "I don't know how you did it. Victor Rookwood gone for good.",
  "PoppySweeting_11332": "Did you hear the librarian gave Sebastian detention again?",
  "PoppySweeting_11333": "It's truly sad about Anne Sallow. I really did like her.",
  "PoppySweeting_11334": "I noticed you speaking to Ominis. Do you know him?",
  "PoppySweeting_11351": "Interesting choice of attire.",
  "PoppySweeting_11352": "I don't know how you beat Imelda Reyes. She's practically undefeated.",
  "PoppySweeting_11373": "Did you know that Fig and his partner used to be world travellers?",
  "PoppySweeting_11374": "About Professor Fig. Well, I know the two of you were close. I'm so sorry.",
  "PoppySweeting_11377": "Shocking, isn't it? We had an attack. On Hogwarts.",
  "PoppySweeting_11388": "She does have a rather stern brow, doesn't she? But look how well you put her at ease.",
  "PoppySweeting_11403": "Let's make our way down. We're nearly at the end of this.",
  "PoppySweeting_11408": "Merlin – it's beautiful.",
  "PoppySweeting_11433": "Well, we found what we came for. Now we just need to bring it to the henge.",
  "PoppySweeting_11450": "It's a small bird with golden feathers. It's incredible. It has rotational wings that allow it to dart quickly in any direction.",
  "PoppySweeting_11480": "We should get back to Dorran. He'll need to see the symbol. And we've got poachers to beat.",
  "PoppySweeting_11481": "Now that I'm older, I wish I could talk to them – get them to see sense. But, sadly, I suspect that wouldn't do any good.",
  "PoppySweeting_11482": "It was chaotic and dangerous and nowhere a child should ever grow up.",
  "PoppySweeting_11485": "That was a Mooncalf dance! Do you know how rare it is to see even one?",
  "PoppySweeting_11489": "Suffice it to say, when I left with Highwing I flew straight for her house.",
  "PoppySweeting_11491": "So am I. There were so many creatures I was unable to help when I was younger. Now that's all I want to do.",
  "PoppySweeting_11492": "The thing I remember most was how much we moved around. Always chasing the 'next big kill'.",
  "PoppySweeting_11499": "What is going on with them?",
  "PoppySweeting_11504": "I never fitted in, but the older I got the more apparent it became. Gran tried for years to convince my parents to let me live with her.",
  "PoppySweeting_11509": "I've had a bit of help.",
  "PoppySweeting_11511": "Perhaps the runes on the walls have something to do with finding the moths.",
  "PoppySweeting_11512": "If we pull the rings and match the runes, I suspect we'll find the moths.",
  "PoppySweeting_11518": "I've never told anyone any of this, but I'm glad that you know. It's nice to have someone to talk about it with.",
  "PoppySweeting_11519": "(cheers)",
  "PoppySweeting_11521": "Look at this place.",
  "PoppySweeting_11526": "Did you see the symbol above the entrance? It's the one the Mooncalves made at the henge.",
  "PoppySweeting_11527": "Of course Dorran implied as much, but to see it up there.",
  "PoppySweeting_11540": "Goodness! What happened here?",
  "PoppySweeting_11541": "Something terrible happened here. I can feel it.",
  "PoppySweeting_11542": "Weasley's always been my favourite professor – although I've never liked transfiguring creatures.",
  "PoppySweeting_11546": "Of course! How clever.",
  "PoppySweeting_11585": "Over here –",
  "PoppySweeting_11586": "I'll let you know when I have news of her location.",
  "PoppySweeting_11592": "Did you spot a Horklump? I usually wander off when I think I've seen one.",
  "PoppySweeting_11593": "Come on, follow me.",
  "PoppySweeting_11596": "Shall we?",
  "PoppySweeting_11597": "On we go.",
  "PoppySweeting_11631": "At least we're out of the classroom.",
  "PoppySweeting_11637": "I think we can safely say that Gerald likes you.",
  "PoppySweeting_11641": "Oh, it seems Professor Howin's ready for the next part of the lesson.",
  "PoppySweeting_11642": "I knew it! I don't think I've ever seen a Hippogriff take to someone this quickly.  You can feed and brush her if you'd like.",
  "PoppySweeting_11643": "I come and check on her every once in a while –",
  "PoppySweeting_11644": "– bring her pasties, tell her what's going on in the castle.",
  "PoppySweeting_11645": "He is. Kindness is one of his best qualities. Right after ambition.  And cleanliness.",
  "PoppySweeting_11650": "What in Merlin's name are you doing?",
  "PoppySweeting_11651": "Her name is Persephone.",
  "PoppySweeting_11666": "I'm ready when you are.",
  "PoppySweeting_11667": "I am. After our dragon rescue at Horntail Hall, I half expect to be ambushed by poachers any time I'm not in the castle.",
  "PoppySweeting_11669": "We'll need to take cover wherever we can. It's the only way we'll make it through.",
  "PoppySweeting_11697": "Fair enough. But I hope you'll let me know if I can be of help. Especially after what you did for Highwing.",
  "PoppySweeting_11698": "This way.",
  "PoppySweeting_11700": "It's a dragon fighting ring! This is Horntail Hall!",
  "PoppySweeting_11701": "Make sure you aren't seen or heard.",
  "PoppySweeting_11702": "I don't think she knew they had her egg. She wouldn't have left without it.",
  "PoppySweeting_11703": "Be careful, won't you? I shall see you back at the castle.",
  "PoppySweeting_11705": "Let's keep searching. But carefully. Merlin only knows what's going on here.",
  "PoppySweeting_11707": "How could they possibly enjoy this? The centaurs have every right to be disgusted with wizardkind.",
  "PoppySweeting_11710": "You're right. If there's anything the poachers are good at it's tracking their prey – and right now we're it.",
  "PoppySweeting_11733": "There's so much we don't know about beasts. So much to learn.",
  "PoppySweeting_11738": "Perhaps nabbed her first and then her egg. Dragons are hard enough to wrangle, let alone maternal ones.",
  "PoppySweeting_11740": "You'd be surprised how easy it is to think like a poacher.",
  "PoppySweeting_11743": "I suspect it's how the poachers found her to begin with. They likely camped here and logged her patterns.",
  "PoppySweeting_11765": "I hate to see a creature get put down like that, but trolls have no business in Hogsmeade.",
  "PoppySweeting_11769": "Congratulations on winning the House Cup! You certainly earned it.",
  "PoppySweeting_11785": "The Music Room is so disruptive with all those bells ringing again.",
  "PoppySweeting_11795": "I saw that Ferdinand Pratt's back at the Three Broomsticks.",
  "PoppySweeting_11796": "Ferdinand must be thrilled to be hanging at the Three Broomsticks again. Where he can spy on everybody.",
  "PoppySweeting_11797": "Wasn't taking Ferdinand to the Hog's Head a bit much?",
  "PoppySweeting_11798": "Ferdinand is every bit a prat, but hanging him in the Hog's Head?",
  "PoppySweeting_11799": "You destroyed Ferdinand's frame? What gave you the right to do that?",
  "PoppySweeting_11800": "I'm no fan of Ferdinand's but it wasn't very nice to destroy one of his frames.",
  "PoppySweeting_12001": "I suppose we could catch our breath.",
  "PoppySweeting_12002": "Whenever you're ready. I'll follow your lead.",
  "PoppySweeting_12004": "I thought we might go and see it for ourselves.",
  "PoppySweeting_12010": "We had the element of surprise on our side when we saved that dragon. But the poachers will be watching for us now.",
  "PoppySweeting_12012": "This is a centuries-old likeness of Pangur Donn: 'fearless mouse hunter and devoted study companion.'",
  "PoppySweeting_12013": "People have always loved their pets. I find that comforting.",
  "PoppySweeting_12014": "How could I have been so blind?",
  "PoppySweeting_12015": "I have some promising news about the location of our Hebridean dragon friend and where to return her you-know-what. Meet me in the town circle in Hogsmeade.",
  "PoppySweeting_12016": "Just the person I was hoping to see!",
  "PoppySweeting_12017": "You and I should meet for a Butterbeer soon. Perhaps Highwing can join us.",
  "PoppySweeting_12018": "I think I know how and where to approach the centaurs about protecting the Snidgets. Meet me in the Forbidden Forest.",
  "PoppySweeting_12019": "Can we meet at the Three Broomsticks? It may finally be safe since we rescued the dragon from Horntail Hall.",
  "PoppySweeting_12020": "I suppose we’ll find out.",
  "PoppySweeting_12021": "That was a Hebridean Black!",
  "PoppySweeting_12022": "Thank you again – for saying something to those brutes so that I didn't have to.",
  "PoppySweeting_12023": "You were an Augurey at noon in the desert.",
  "PoppySweeting_12024": "It's something my gran and I say. It means that something or someone is a welcome surprise.",
  "PoppySweeting_12025": "At least – that's what we decided it meant.",
  "PoppySweeting_12026": "Actually, in light of that, there's someone I'd like you to meet. In the Forest.",
  "PoppySweeting_12027": "We're of a similar mind.",
  "PoppySweeting_12028": "You may have noticed that poachers are something of a problem in the area. So I worry they could get her again. And I might not be there next time.",
  "PoppySweeting_12029": "They're up to something. I'm just not sure what.",
  "PoppySweeting_12030": "I don't often agree with Professor Howin, but on that, I fear she's right.",
  "PoppySweeting_12031": "The poachers' influence is growing. I see them every day in the village: lingering, talking to people –",
  "PoppySweeting_12032": "Oh – very well. I will.",
  "PoppySweeting_12033": "I've seen it first-hand with her.",
  "PoppySweeting_12034": "It's hard to explain, but something about it just feels – wrong.",
  "PoppySweeting_12035": "It's – a longer story, but I rescued her from poachers a few years back. Got her to safety and, well, she was fine. Until recently.",
  "PoppySweeting_12036": "Exactly.",
  "PoppySweeting_12037": "I think I'm going to look into it. Find out what's going on. What they're doing.",
  "PoppySweeting_12038": "They don't scare me. Besides, I'd do anything to keep Highwing safe.",
  "PoppySweeting_12039": "And the more I know, the better I can keep Highwing safe.",
  "PoppySweeting_12041": "I should be going, but – we'll speak again soon, I hope.",
  "PoppySweeting_12042": "You wouldn't know from looking at her, but she's a dreadful busybody.",
  "PoppySweeting_12043": "Meanwhile, please do keep Highwing a secret. I'm a little worried for her at the moment.",
  "PoppySweeting_12044": "Anything interesting?",
  "PoppySweeting_12045": "Is Highwing all right? Natty told me what the two of you did!",
  "PoppySweeting_12046": "Natty told me about your run in with the poachers. I have some news about them as well. Can you meet me soon? I fear that some of what I uncovered has to do with you.",
  "PoppySweeting_12047": "What are you doing here? Especially during the day.",
  "PoppySweeting_12050": "Good. Whatever the poachers are up to, I want Highwing far from it.",
  "PoppySweeting_12060": "Merlin, you'd think they were guarding the Minister for Magic himself. What is going on here?",
  "PoppySweeting_12062": "What's going on down there?",
  "PoppySweeting_12074": "They must've only just captured her. She's putting up quite the fight.",
  "PoppySweeting_12075": "Let's even her odds, shall we?",
  "PoppySweeting_12076": "We don't have time! We need to free her now before more show up!",
  "PoppySweeting_12081": "Do you know why? Or what it means? Does it have to do with the Snidgets?",
  "PoppySweeting_12082": "The poachers spoke of this area, and I thought if we searched around a bit it might give us clues as to what they're doing.",
  "PoppySweeting_12088": "There must be more dragons here. The poachers are far too greedy to run a fighting ring with only two dragons.",
  "PoppySweeting_12089": "We should take advantage of most eyes being on the fight and look around. But be discreet. You especially can't afford to be spotted.",
  "PoppySweeting_12092": "I'd actually like you to know. About five years ago, Highwing had been captured by poachers.",
  "PoppySweeting_12094": "Nothing keeps Gran down. She set up a Caterwauling Charm and threatened to make a coat out of the next poacher that set foot on her doorstep.",
  "PoppySweeting_12095": "I hope so. Gran understands how important it is to – protect those who need it.",
  "PoppySweeting_12097": "At first they planned to sell her, but soon decided they wanted to kill her instead – more money I suppose.",
  "PoppySweeting_12098": "I'd finally had enough. I freed Highwing and we ran. We'd flown for ages when I spotted Mooncalves dancing below and we landed to watch them.",
  "PoppySweeting_12099": "You see, the night I freed Highwing was also the night I ran away from home. A poacher camp.",
  "PoppySweeting_12100": "It felt like an omen. A good one. A sign that the worst was over.",
  "PoppySweeting_12101": "I still feel terrible that I'm the reason they went there.",
  "PoppySweeting_12103": "Look! They've got a dragon egg! Hebridean, from the looks of it. We can't leave it here. Not with the plans they likely have for it.",
  "PoppySweeting_12105": "Ready? The element of surprise will only buy us a few seconds.",
  "PoppySweeting_12106": "Like to torture dragons, do you?",
  "PoppySweeting_12107": "See how you like this!",
  "PoppySweeting_12114": "Ridiculous, really. Rumour was that the cave drove people mad. I couldn't find any account by someone who had been in the cave, though.",
  "PoppySweeting_12117": "Thank you for your help. Let's carry on.  Feed and brush the Kneazles just as you did with Gerald.",
  "PoppySweeting_12118": "We should do as Dorran suggested and bring the moonstone to the henge.",
  "PoppySweeting_12119": "A good thing too. We need every advantage over the poachers if we're to get to the Snidgets first.",
  "PoppySweeting_12120": "We still have the poachers to contend with.",
  "PoppySweeting_12121": "That's the third time I've seen a Dugbog behave that violently.",
  "PoppySweeting_12124": "'A knotty Kneazle is an unhappy Kneazle', my gran always says.",
  "PoppySweeting_12125": "The Kneazles don't like the food pellets nearly as much as the Puffskeins. More refined palates, I suppose.",
  "PoppySweeting_12132": "Poachers are nomadic and most of the ones in the area aren't any I'd grown up with.",
  "PoppySweeting_12133": "They only ever happen under a full moon – though I suppose the moonstone allowed it to happen now.",
  "PoppySweeting_12134": "It was pure luck the first time. I was on Highwing or I'd never have spotted it. It was the night – ",
  "PoppySweeting_12135": "Well, the night I met Highwing, actually. I – ",
  "PoppySweeting_12136": "All part of the dance. No one pattern is ever the same though. We'll need to draw this one to get a better sense of it.",
  "PoppySweeting_12137": "Can't wait to tell Gran I've managed to see not one but two Mooncalf dances. She'll be jealous.",
  "PoppySweeting_12138": "I come from a family of poachers.",
  "PoppySweeting_12139": "I can try. And, I've had a bit of help so far.",
  "PoppySweeting_12140": "That said, I suspect someone must have recognised me. That's how they got to Gran.",
  "PoppySweeting_12141": "Let's find out. Dorran's waiting for us just up ahead.",
  "PoppySweeting_12142": "If it's all right Dorran, I think I'd like to stay behind and spend a little more time with the Snidgets.",
  "PoppySweeting_12143": "It took a few hours and some eye-watering maps, but I think this might be the cave Dorran told us about.",
  "PoppySweeting_12147": "The important thing is that we survived it. And we returned her egg.",
  "PoppySweeting_12148": "True. True. So why haven't they come after us? It's not like them to let things lie. Unless –",
  "PoppySweeting_12149": "Unless – they haven't let things lie!",
  "PoppySweeting_12150": "Not at all – I was just at the post office. Gran told me to expect a package, but it looks as if she forgot to send it.",
  "PoppySweeting_12151": "Only some feed she's been developing. I was going to give it to Professor Howin for the Kneazles.",
  "PoppySweeting_12152": "It varies from week to week, but it's always to do with creatures. Last week she was studying leg knots in Plimpys.",
  "PoppySweeting_12153": "She didn't send me an owl this week either. Perhaps she's busy with her research.",
  "PoppySweeting_12154": "I am. After our dragon rescue at Horntail Hall, I half expect to be ambushed by poachers anytime I'm not in the castle.",
  "PoppySweeting_12155": "True. True. So why haven't they come after us? It's not like them to let things lie. Unless –",
  "PoppySweeting_12156": "Unless – they haven't let things lie!",
  "PoppySweeting_12157": "The poachers got to my gran. Someone recognised me in Horntail Hall and – they got to her.",
  "PoppySweeting_12158": "She said they took the whole place apart looking for it – screaming that we'd cost them everything.",
  "PoppySweeting_12160": "She's fine, thank goodness. But they were at her house. Our house. They assumed I'd sent the egg there.",
  "PoppySweeting_12163": "Beautiful.",
  "PoppySweeting_12164": "If you ever meet my Gran, this trip never happened.",
  "PoppySweeting_12165": "A centaur! Tread carefully.",
  "PoppySweeting_12168": "I did notice the poachers talking with a few villagers in Hogsmeade. I'm not sure why. Perhaps that's why the centaurs are suspicious.",
  "PoppySweeting_12170": "That could have gone worse. Centaurs aren't exactly fans of wizardkind. And the poachers aren't helping matters.",
  "PoppySweeting_12174": "What's this?",
  "PoppySweeting_12175": "Don't remind me. The thought of that tent still makes my blood boil.",
  "PoppySweeting_12176": "I've been thinking about those poor dragons in the fighting ring. The collars they were wearing. They appeared to be goblin silver.",
  "PoppySweeting_12177": "Surely you aren't suggesting that the collars somehow control the poor creatures.",
  "PoppySweeting_12179": "Understood. We all have our secrets.",
  "PoppySweeting_12180": "I think a collar is precisely what we found at that poacher camp. I've never known poachers to use anything like that before.",
  "PoppySweeting_12184": "That attack always did strike me as a little strange – seemingly coming out of nowhere.",
  "PoppySweeting_12185": "It seems I may have caused you more trouble with Victor Rookwood. Why is he after you?",
  "PoppySweeting_12188": "Don't worry. I'll guard your secret as if it were my own.",
  "PoppySweeting_12189": "I shan't press for more details. In fact, I should probably be going. I'd like to track that dragon down as soon as I can.",
  "PoppySweeting_12196": "Gran says the journals were a bit cryptic – which is good. Perhaps the poachers won't be clever enough to find the birds.",
  "PoppySweeting_12197": "They could make more money with Snidgets than they ever would have fighting dragons.",
  "PoppySweeting_12199": "Still, I think they may be our only hope. Let me think on it.",
  "PoppySweeting_12200": "This is odd.",
  "PoppySweeting_12201": "Not entirely sure. But look around. If the poachers were here, perhaps we can find out why.",
  "PoppySweeting_12203": "I normally tell her everything. She might be my best friend after Highwing, but she knows how I feel about the poachers.",
  "PoppySweeting_12204": "I think she worries I'll do something ill-advised.",
  "PoppySweeting_12206": "I found goblin armour.",
  "PoppySweeting_12208": "I don't have a good feeling about this.",
  "PoppySweeting_12209": "Well, they don't exactly know we're coming, so it's less of a meeting and more of a surprise, I suppose?",
  "PoppySweeting_12211": "I hope you're right.",
  "PoppySweeting_12213": "Perhaps they'll be able to tell that we're sincere. There's something about them that's so knowing. It's almost unnerving.",
  "PoppySweeting_12215": "We'll meet with them, tell them about the Snidgets and I'm sure it'll all be fi – ",
  "PoppySweeting_12216": "Definitely poachers.",
  "PoppySweeting_12217": "How do goblin and poacher interests align?",
  "PoppySweeting_12229": "We're fine, but if you hadn't got here when you did – ",
  "PoppySweeting_12230": "I led them here, Dorran.",
  "PoppySweeting_12231": "I'm glad we seem to be a step ahead of the poachers.",
  "PoppySweeting_12232": "If we're lucky, they're still poring over Gran's research. There was a fair amount.",
  "PoppySweeting_12233": "We on the other hand had Dorran to guide us. Even if the poachers do somehow stumble upon this place, we shall be long gone.",
  "PoppySweeting_12234": "So what does happen next? What are these pillars here?",
  "PoppySweeting_12235": "That did it! Look, Dorran! A doorway!",
  "PoppySweeting_12236": "Look at the murals on the wall. They're all creatures.",
  "PoppySweeting_12237": "This place must have been built to protect them. They had nothing to fear.",
  "PoppySweeting_12239": "The poacher camps always felt oppressive. It's hard to explain, but the feeling was palpable. At least to me.",
  "PoppySweeting_12240": "The sense I get here is of safety and calm. Quite the opposite of the poacher camps.",
  "PoppySweeting_12241": "You haven't seen my Gran's study.",
  "PoppySweeting_12242": "And the books are all about creatures.",
  "PoppySweeting_12243": "She would! I can't wait to tell her all about it.",
  "PoppySweeting_12244": "What was that?",
  "PoppySweeting_12245": "No!",
  "PoppySweeting_12246": "The plates on the floor have symbols on them.",
  "PoppySweeting_12247": "I wonder if we can find anything else nearby with symbols that match the ones on the plates.",
  "PoppySweeting_12248": "Each symbol must represent a spell we could cast – on an object that belongs with each plate.",
  "PoppySweeting_12249": "I wonder if the pillars move at all.",
  "PoppySweeting_12250": "Perhaps it has to do with the light and the darkness.",
  "PoppySweeting_12251": "Two symbols on the wall aren't lit. I wonder if casting a shadow on those symbols on the ground would do something.",
  "PoppySweeting_12252": "You're not coming in with us?",
  "PoppySweeting_12253": "Sounds as if someone's in trouble.",
  "PoppySweeting_12254": "Haven't we seen that tree before? I think it's the one from that map you found in the well.",
  "PoppySweeting_12255": "What a lovely area.",
  "PoppySweeting_12259": "I adore the Forbidden Forest. Full of an amazing array of creatures. We should get a whole new perspective on them by candlelight.",
  "PoppySweeting_12260": "Well, that was worthwhile.",
  "PoppySweeting_12261": "Oh no! I can't believe I didn't see it – we need to leave! I need to send an owl.",
  "PoppySweeting_12265": "Oh no! I can't believe I didn't see it. We need to leave. I need to send an owl.",
  "PoppySweeting_12268": "I wonder who the map belonged to. I hope they won't mind us going in their stead.",
  "PoppySweeting_12269": "Pity there weren't any trousers. It would have made a nice ensemble.",
  "PoppySweeting_12270": "What are those?",
  "PoppySweeting_12321": "If anyone can keep them out of poacher hands, it's the centaurs.",
  "PoppySweeting_12322": "And I wanted to thank you.",
  "PoppySweeting_12323": "When the poachers ambushed us, I – it was – nice not to face them alone.",
  "PoppySweeting_12324": "I am glad you came to Hogwarts. It's already been my best year.",
  "PoppySweeting_12325": "I used to spend most of my time with Highwing – and, well, I don't know how Sirona feels about Hippogriffs popping in for a Butterbeer.",
  "PoppySweeting_12326": "I suppose so.",
  "PoppySweeting_12327": "That makes two of us.",
  "PoppySweeting_12328": "I wouldn't want a repeat of Horntail Hall of course, but I did enjoy the Three Broomsticks. Had no idea how lovely it was there.",
  "PoppySweeting_12329": "Highwing's the only one I would have gone with. Or Gran, of course.",
  "PoppySweeting_12330": "She is. Although I am beginning to see the appeal of, er, human friends.",
  "PoppySweeting_12331": "I am starting to see the appeal of, er, human friends.",
  "PoppySweeting_12332": "It was nice to talk about my parents – and Gran – with someone. And share Highwing.",
  "PoppySweeting_12334": "Goodness! Well, that certainly helps explain a bit about what we saw back at Horntail Hall.",
  "PoppySweeting_12335": "Of course, I'll guard your secret as if it were my own. Even the centaurs won't know.",
  "PoppySweeting_12336": "Yes. Of course. You're absolutely right.",
  "PoppySweeting_12338": "Merlin's beard! You're a genius! The centaurs! They'd want the Snidgets protected at all costs.",
  "PoppySweeting_12343": "The Golden Snidget's feathers and eyes are incredibly valuable. That's why they're believed to be extinct. They were hunted out of existence by wizardkind.",
  "PoppySweeting_12344": "Oh good, you're safe!",
  "PoppySweeting_12346": "Merlin. I don't think the dragon we set free was wearing a collar, but we should check. And if we can find her, we can return her egg.",
  "PoppySweeting_12347": "We should see this through. Let me find out where she is.",
  "PoppySweeting_12348": "I'll start looking into it right away.",
  "PoppySweeting_12350": "There – was something else that I wanted to discuss with you. I didn't want to press it before.",
  "PoppySweeting_12351": "I don't understand –",
  "PoppySweeting_12352": "So the moonlight mentioned in the journal doesn't refer to actual moonlight, but to a moonstone?",
  "PoppySweeting_12353": "I am too.",
  "PoppySweeting_12354": "Centaurs can be cryptic. Gran says no one talks more in circles than a centaur.",
  "PoppySweeting_12355": "I can head to the library and start looking into the cave he mentioned.",
  "PoppySweeting_12356": "And why was he so certain about where we could find one?",
  "PoppySweeting_12357": "It is a shame how quickly he left. What was his name? 'Dorran'?",
  "PoppySweeting_12358": "Well, if Dorran knows something we don't, I'd rather act now and ask questions later.",
  "PoppySweeting_12359": "Knowing centaurs, I suspect he's referring to a specific moonstone. We'll likely know it when we see it.",
  "PoppySweeting_12360": "What do moonstones have to do with Snidgets?",
  "PoppySweeting_12361": "That's the henge, precisely where Dorran said it would be. But now that we're here, I'm not entirely sure how to feel.",
  "PoppySweeting_12362": "We knew we were at the cave for the moonstone, but Dorran didn't tell us what to expect when we placed the stone in the henge.",
  "PoppySweeting_12365": "You're right. I suppose I'm worrying over nothing.",
  "PoppySweeting_12367": "I realised that she didn't know the poachers had her egg. So when she left Horntail Hall, she would've headed straight to her nest.",
  "PoppySweeting_12369": "I went back to the tent and tracked her flight.",
  "PoppySweeting_12370": "Tree canopies, burn marks, things like that.",
  "PoppySweeting_12371": "I can't be certain, but I have an idea of one place she may have been heading.",
  "PoppySweeting_12376": "I think I know where we can find Dorran. Meet me in the Forbidden Forest and we can tell him about the symbol the Mooncalves made.",
  "PoppySweeting_12377": "I think we can safely say we know where the moonstone goes.",
  "PoppySweeting_12378": "Just – barely. I think the pattern's a – bird. At least that's what it looks like.",
  "PoppySweeting_12382": "Of course. I'll just wait here and try not to fall asleep.",
  "PoppySweeting_12383": "Of course! That's it! We need to show this to Dorran – not that I'd know where to find him at this hour.",
  "PoppySweeting_12384": "Perhaps we should head back to the castle, and we can track him down after a good night's sleep.",
  "PoppySweeting_12385": "We can head back to the castle if you've seen enough Mooncalves for one day.",
  "PoppySweeting_12386": "Take your time.",
  "PoppySweeting_12394": "It's nice to get rewarded for helping others. Even if it is an enchanted well.",
  "PoppySweeting_12395": "Fantastic.",
  "PoppySweeting_12396": "Good thinking, but she'd still be able to smell you.",
  "PoppySweeting_12397": "There's the nest! We're almost there!",
  "PoppySweeting_12398": "Why is every bridge here broken?",
  "PoppySweeting_12399": "That would work if dragons didn't have such a keen sense of smell.",
  "PoppySweeting_12407": "Did you hear those goblins? Ranrok and the poachers must be working together!",
  "PoppySweeting_12409": "Now's our chance to free her! Reinforcements will be on the way!",
  "PoppySweeting_12412": "I'd much rather we have it than the poachers – at least for now, but I don't think we should keep it indefinitely.",
  "PoppySweeting_12414": "It'd be foolish not to expect it. They're not a forgiving lot.",
  "PoppySweeting_12417": "It's nothing. Truly. I've – we've no secrets to hide.",
  "PoppySweeting_12418": "That was for Gran!",
  "PoppySweeting_12419": "You're not getting those Snidgets!",
  "PoppySweeting_12420": "That was for Horntail Hall!",
  "PoppySweeting_12421": "You're despicable! The lot of you!",
  "PoppySweeting_12422": "Don't think I won't fight till the end!",
  "PoppySweeting_12423": "I haven't, but I'm perfectly fine with that.",
  "PoppySweeting_12424": "I couldn't hold it in any longer. I told her everything.",
  "PoppySweeting_12425": "Don't know that I can. We've taken on poachers twice now. Successfully. I rather think you've helped me develop a taste for it.",
  "PoppySweeting_12426": "And with centaurs as allies, I might actually go looking for trouble.",
  "PoppySweeting_12427": "Well, I'm still not sure this is the cave, but it did seem the most promising.",
  "PoppySweeting_12428": "I stumbled across some folklore about a cave in the area that people avoid. Seemed the perfect place to hide something of value.",
  "PoppySweeting_12429": "It's a bit of a leap, I confess. But might a mysterious item such as a special moonstone be hidden in an equally mysterious cave?",
  "PoppySweeting_12430": "So, either it is a rumour – or anyone who went in wasn't in any state to speak of it afterwards.",
  "PoppySweeting_12431": "I think I'm desperate for anything at this point.",
  "PoppySweeting_12432": "Agreed.",
  "PoppySweeting_12433": "You did it!",
  "PoppySweeting_12434": "It looks as if it raised something out of the water!",
  "PoppySweeting_12435": "Are you familiar with the hamlet of Irondale? It's south of the castle. I think the cave that Dorran wanted us to find is near there.",
  "PoppySweeting_12436": "The clock is ticking in that regard, isn't it?",
  "PoppySweeting_12437": "That's what Gran always says!",
  "PoppySweeting_12441": "I should have known. I underestimated the poachers.",
  "PoppySweeting_12443": "And now another creature's in danger.",
  "PoppySweeting_12444": "The poachers refused to leave empty-handed, so they took valuable journals that Gran had discovered when she was researching rare creatures.",
  "PoppySweeting_12445": "Gran wants me to stay out of it. But I know she's devastated that poachers might go after the Snidgets – if they still exist.",
  "PoppySweeting_12446": "Perhaps you're right. It's just – never mind.",
  "PoppySweeting_12447": "That's exactly the right word. I just – never mind.",
  "PoppySweeting_12448": "Thank you for doing this with me. Wouldn't blame you one bit if you wanted to head back to the castle and never think about dragons again.",
  "PoppySweeting_12449": "I don't know. Nothing about this day was expected – not the goblins and definitely not the fighting ring. The last thing I planned on was a dragon egg.",
  "PoppySweeting_12451": "And the poachers saw us. Which cannot be good.",
  "PoppySweeting_12452": "Goodness! Well, that certainly helps to shed light on what we saw at the tent.",
  "PoppySweeting_12453": "If the poachers found some now, I can't bear to think about the horrific way they'd be bred and killed for profit.",
  "PoppySweeting_12454": "From what she recalls, the journals only noted that the key to finding them 'lay in the moonlight'. Gran thinks it can be narrowed down to a handful of locations.",
  "PoppySweeting_12455": "We don't have a choice – if we want to help the Snidgets.",
  "PoppySweeting_12456": "However, I wouldn't be surprised if word has got back to them. Some days a part of me hopes that it has.",
  "PoppySweeting_12457": "She was livid that I'd been anywhere near the poachers. But she confessed that she was rather envious about the Snidgets.",
  "PoppySweeting_12458": "Given what Fwoopers are known to do, I never thought I'd be so happy to see this many of them.",
  "PoppySweeting_12459": "Very funny. I was just thinking how it's proof that poachers haven't been here – assuming this is where the moonstone is.",
  "PoppySweeting_12460": "Which means we're one step ahead of them.",
  "PoppySweeting_12461": "They seem calm enough at the moment. We probably shouldn't linger for too long.",
  "PoppySweeting_12462": "I'm sorry. I thought about it so many times. But – I'm ashamed of who I – who my family is.",
  "PoppySweeting_12463": "No wonder the poachers were in Hogsmeade so much. Likely taking bets and spreading the word, given how crowded it is here.",
  "PoppySweeting_12464": "I know Adelaide and her uncle well. No wonder she's been anxious lately.",
  "PoppySweeting_12465": "– did you know that they have orders from Victor Rookwood to capture you on sight?",
  "PoppySweeting_12466": "Does this have anything to do with Rookwood and Harlow coming for you in the Three Broomsticks after the troll attack?",
  "PoppySweeting_12467": "Does the name 'Horntail Hall' mean anything to you?",
  "PoppySweeting_12469": "I'm sorry to say that you likely have a larger target on your back now, because of what we just did.",
  "PoppySweeting_12470": "Adelaide mentioned her uncle Rowland's camp may lie near Brocburrow – past the river.",
  "PoppySweeting_12471": "If this is Mr Oakes's campsite, we're in for trouble.",
  "PoppySweeting_12472": "We could be discreet – look around without them ever knowing we were here.",
  "PoppySweeting_12473": "If Mr Oakes was here, there's no sign of him now.",
  "PoppySweeting_12474": "Oakes is an experienced trader. He marked that map for a reason.",
  "PoppySweeting_12475": "His journal left behind? This can't be good.",
  "PoppySweeting_12476": "Taking over camps and castles – this is highly unusual for goblins.",
  "PoppySweeting_12477": "Oh. A part of me hoped it'd be cheerier on the inside.",
  "PoppySweeting_12478": "Boiler doors usually need to be lit to operate. This one's probably no exception.",
  "PoppySweeting_12479": "That furnace could be promising.",
  "PoppySweeting_12480": "Try lighting that furnace. It must be connected to the boiler door.",
  "PoppySweeting_12481": "I saw a boiler door on our way down. Perhaps we should take a closer look there.",
  "PoppySweeting_12489": "It'll be hard hiding something like this from Professor Weasley for long.",
  "PoppySweeting_12497": "We have some spectators. The trials are popular.",
  "PoppySweeting_12499": "Mr Oakes was lucky. Ranrok's lot would never have freed him.",
  "PoppySweeting_12500": "I saw movement higher up in the keep. We should find our way there.",
  "PoppySweeting_12501": "A ladder – that's what we need.",
  "PoppySweeting_12513": "We need to find the tomb near Brocburrow and place Samantha's family crest on a sarcophagus there.",
  "PoppySweeting_12514": "Seems our feet haven't been cursed. That's a good sign, I suppose.",
  "PoppySweeting_12515": "Not ideal, but we should have expected it. Trolls can enjoy dark, damp spaces.",
  "PoppySweeting_12516": "Samantha will be glad to hear that the crest has been returned. I certainly hope it reverses the curse.",
  "PoppySweeting_12517": "She was breeding the spiders for profit and they turned on her. I don't condone what she did, but she did not deserve this.",
  "PoppySweeting_12518": "This must be Aranshire. We'd better keep an eye out for spiders.",
  "PoppySweeting_12519": "A ladder. Not sure I want to know where this leads.",
  "PoppySweeting_12520": "That's the last of the spider sacs.",
  "PoppySweeting_12521": "I hope that's the last spider.",
  "PoppySweeting_12522": "Well done. I believe it's dead.",
  "PoppySweeting_12539": "Be on your guard.",
  "PoppySweeting_12543": "I'll wager this isn't the dead end it seems to be. But how to get through?",
  "PoppySweeting_12545": "They won't be happy to see us. Should we use disillusionment? Or perhaps a less discreet approach?",
  "PoppySweeting_12546": "What in Merlin's name – ?",
  "PoppySweeting_12547": "That's a relief. Thought we were done for.",
  "PoppySweeting_12548": "That was far too close for my liking.",
  "PoppySweeting_12549": "Up ahead – looks like a way out.",
  "PoppySweeting_12550": "If we're spotted, they'll feed us to the dragons.",
  "PoppySweeting_12551": "Aim for the ring at the front of her restraint!",
  "PoppySweeting_12552": "Use <i>Accio</i> on the ring! We need to free her!",
  "PoppySweeting_12553": "Oh, look! It's a deer.",
  "PoppySweeting_12554": "I've noticed that too. It's almost like there's something in the water.",
  "PoppySweeting_12555": "(laughs)",
  "PoppySweeting_12556": "(laughs)",
  "PoppySweeting_12557": "(nervous gasp)",
  "PoppySweeting_12558": "That's it. Get it all out of your system.",
  "PoppySweeting_12559": "You're really quite the terror, aren't you?",
  "PoppySweeting_12560": "I suppose if one can fix it one can break it.",
  "PoppySweeting_12561": "Why on earth would you do that?",
  "PoppySweeting_12562": "I can't believe you did that! Why would you do that?",
  "PoppySweeting_12563": "That was brilliant! Do it again!",
  "PoppySweeting_12588": "It's a shame but it had to be done.",
  "PoppySweeting_12589": "Can't say I regret that one bit.",
  "PoppySweeting_12590": "You didn't have a choice.",
  "PoppySweeting_12591": "I sincerely hope we never have to do that again.",
  "PoppySweeting_12592": "I wish there had been another way.",
  "PoppySweeting_12620": "Trolls don't just ambush villages.",
  "PoppySweeting_12621": "Oh, thank goodness you're all right. I heard all about the siege.",
  "PoppySweeting_12622": "See someone's not afraid of the Dark Arts.",
  "PoppySweeting_12624": "Getting in a bit of practice, are we?",
  "PoppySweeting_12652": "Oh! Pardon me.",
  "PoppySweeting_12653": "(Gasp!) ",
  "PoppySweeting_12654": "It did. I overheard them talking in the Hog's Head and –",
  "PoppySweeting_12655": "(laboured breathing)",
  "PoppySweeting_12657": "I've been thinking about those poor dragons in the fighting ring. The collars they were wearing.",
  "PoppySweeting_12658": "I don't think the dragon we set free was wearing a collar, but we should check. And if we can find her, we can return her egg.",
  "PoppySweeting_12659": "I'll start looking into it right away.",
  "PoppySweeting_12660": "We should see this through. Let me find out where she is.",

  "RichardJackdaw_10199": "I was having a look about when I suddenly sensed a refreshing breeze –  after which I felt, well, light-headed. That's all I remember.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10200": "Hence, if you do find yourself in a cave, be prepared. I can't tell you what for, specifically, but you seem a perceptive sort. Beware a light breeze.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10201": "Have you never met any members of the Black family? They can be rather – vindictive.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10202": "Once Anne showed an interest in me,  Apollonia couldn't let it alone. That her own heart had grown cold simply didn't matter.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10217": "Keep your eyes open for a birdbath. When you find it, say 'intra muros.' I think it's Latin. Or Greek.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10219": "As you can imagine, I never paid much attention in school. Shall we?",
  "RichardJackdaw_10221": "Here I am, as good as my word.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10222": "I suppose I shouldn't be surprised to see you. Just like a Gryffindor to brave the Forbidden Forest in pursuit of adventure.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10223": "I suppose I shouldn't be surprised to see you. It would take the patience of a Hufflepuff to track down these pages.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10224": "I suppose I shouldn't be surprised to see you. Only a Ravenclaw would travel this far in pursuit of knowledge.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10226": "I suppose I shouldn't be surprised to see you. It took the cunning of a Slytherin to track down these pages.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10227": "I thought a secret map I pilfered from Peeves would pique her interest, but she simply rolled her eyes.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10230": "They're not here. I thought if Apollonia wasn't interested in the map on the pages, perhaps it would lead to something that would intrigue her.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10231": "Here's an idea – why don't you meet me at the edge of the Forbidden Forest and I'll show you where to find the pages?",
  "RichardJackdaw_10232": "I'm sure the pages are still tucked in my waistcoat.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10233": "Near the Forbidden Forest. Easy enough to find from the castle. Look for a foreboding tangle of thick, black trees.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10234": "I'm almost certain I dropped it the moment I was beheaded in that cave. Oh, it was sheer folly to follow that map.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10236": "I didn't steal the pages from his ghostly form. I merely found them in his wake of destruction.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10237": "He's got a penchant for wrecking things – books, bottles, suits of armour – whatever's likely to cause the most chaos.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10238": "I doubt he even noticed they were gone.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10239": "Indeed. Say, here's an idea – why don't you meet me at the edge of the Forbidden Forest? I'd be happy to show you where to find them.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10240": "If you don't mind the sight of a – well, my decapitated skeleton, the wand and the pages are yours for the taking.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10243": "Tell you what, meet me at the edge of the Forbidden Forest and I'll show you precisely where to find them.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10244": "I shall see you there.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10248": "'What would I want with yellowed, old pages torn from a book?' Not my finest moment.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10249": "So I followed the map – to what I can only describe as an enchanted cave of some kind. And – you see what happened next. (swishing noise)",
  "RichardJackdaw_10250": "If you don't mind the sight of a – well, my decapitated skeleton, they're yours for the taking.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10254": "Ridiculous, really. Found it on some yellowed, old pages Peeves had pilfered. Thought I could impress a girl. But that's a story for another day.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10255": "I didn't steal the pages from his ghostly form. I merely found them in his wake of destruction.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10256": "He has a penchant for wrecking things – books, bottles, suits of armour – whatever's sure to cause the most chaos.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10257": "He dropped them after a particularly aggressive romp through the library.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10258": "I didn't steal the pages from his ghostly form. I merely found them in his wake of destruction.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10259": "He has a penchant for wrecking things – books, bottles, suits of armour – whatever's likely to cause the most chaos.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10260": "Found them on the floor outside the library where he discarded them. Not my luckiest find, all things considered.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10262": "Ooh, ah! Oh. Ah.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10263": "Follow me. I shall lead you as far as I can, but I fear I may remain a tad reluctant to revisit the scene of my demise.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10265": "Mmm. Yes. You know, the closer we get, the more I'm remembering. Probably best I leave you to it.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10266": "Simply stick to the path and keep a sharp eye out for that birdbath. Adieu. Is that Latin? Or Greek? Hmm.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10267": "Ah. Sorry to say, I sold the ring a long time ago. Poor Scrope. Still holds a candle for Apollonia, I reckon.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10268": "Can't say I blame him. I stole all these treasures just to impress her. Alas, 'twas to no avail.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10269": "Odd to hear it all reduced to such absurdity, but, yes. Why do you care about some old wand?",
  "RichardJackdaw_10270": "Indeed. A few landmarks – a stone bridge, a waterfall, and, if I recall, a lake. You'll see.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10271": "Surprising how much of this is – rather unfortunately – coming back to me.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10272": "Did you hear something? Likely nothing.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10273": "Not sure how much you really need me at this point.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10274": "Quite. I'm finding it all rather gloomy. Which, considering I'm a headless ghost, is saying something.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10275": "But you'll be fine. Simply keep your wits about you. Remember the landmarks, and keep an eye out for that birdbath.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10276": "I do? That was my puzzle you solved. What are you doing here?",
  "RichardJackdaw_10277": "Dare I ask? How is she?",
  "RichardJackdaw_10278": "What? Azkaban? Oh, poor Anne. I had no idea. I thought she'd written me off.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10279": "I've been travelling the world for years to mend my broken heart. I came back here only recently on a whim.",
  "RichardJackdaw_10280": "I must speak to the Auror you mentioned and see how I can help Anne.",
  "RichardJackdawHead_10030": "Whatever you say, Dumfrey. This is not my finest moment.",
  "RichardJackdawHead_10046": "(muffled curses)",
  "RichardJackdawHead_10047": "(muffled groans)",
  "RichardJackdawHead_10050": "Is it over yet? Are we still going?",
  "RichardJackdawHead_10051": "Here we go again.",
  "RichardJackdawHead_10052": "Why did I come back here?",
  "RichardJackdawHead_10056": "Say, here's an idea – why don't you meet me at the edge of the Forbidden Forest and I'll show you where to go?",
  "RichardJackdawHead_10058": "Yes.  You'd think a decapitated ghost would get used to the word 'corpse'.",
  "RichardJackdawHead_10061": "Nicely done. But what's going on? You're not a member of the Headless Hunt.",
  "RichardJackdawHead_10062": "Not to worry. I'll just need to be reunited with my body first, but Dumfrey can handle that.",
  "RichardJackdawHead_10066": "Aside from my mortal remains? If I remember correctly, some treasures, a magical bridge –",
  "RichardJackdawHead_10067": "I was having a look about when I suddenly sensed a refreshing breeze – after which I felt, well, light-headed. That's all I remember.",
  "RichardJackdawHead_10068": "Hence, when you visit, be prepared. I can't tell you what for, specifically, but you seem a perceptive sort. Beware a light breeze.",
  "RichardJackdawHead_10069": "Oh, and congratulations. We don't get many mortal competitors round here.",
  "RichardJackdawHead_10070": "Merlin's beard! I know precisely the ones you mean. I pinched them from Peeves. How could I forget?",
  "RichardJackdawHead_10071": "But what kind of an adventure would it be if I spoiled the surprises for you?",
  "RichardJackdawHead_10072": "See you at the forest's edge.",
  "RichardJackdawHead_10073": "The map on those pages led me to my demise. I was not ready for what awaited me in that cave.",
  "RichardJackdawHead_10076": "The pages are likely still mouldering away with my, er, remains. Quite a final adventure, I must confess.",
  "RichardJackdawHead_10077": "I didn't steal the pages from his ghostly form. I merely found them in his wake of destruction.",
  "RichardJackdawHead_10078": "He has a penchant for wrecking things – books, bottles, suits of armour – whatever's likely to cause the most chaos.",
  "RichardJackdawHead_10079": "I found them after he ran riot through the library. Doubt he even noticed they were gone.",
  "RohanPrakash_10023": "That I do! The name is Rohan Prakash. And welcome to the oldest shop in the region!",
  "RohanPrakash_10024": "Well, I've only been running it a short time myself. But my father ran it for many years before he – fell ill.",
  "RohanPrakash_10025": "Oh, he's still around. Would love to be doing what I'm doing. Until he is able, however, I will gladly manage it for the both of us.",
  "RohanPrakash_10026": "Thank you – from both of us. Perhaps one day his health will improve, and we'll work side by side once again.",
  "RohanPrakash_10027": "But for now, a word about your health and safety.",
  "RohanPrakash_10028": "I assume you're as concerned as the rest of us about the goblin uprising, the Dark wizards – even the Dugbogs have gone mad.",
  "RohanPrakash_10029": "But our shop can sell you any number of supplies that will help to keep you safe from all of that.",
  "RohanPrakash_10030": "Please, have a look! And do come back. You're always welcome here.",
  "RohanPrakash_10031": "I appreciate your words.",
  "RohanPrakash_10032": "If you're going to a fancy-dress party, I think you can do better.",
  "RohanPrakash_10033": "No good can ever come from that kind of magic.",
  "RohanPrakash_10035": "Please, watch where you're aiming.",
  "RohanPrakash_10036": "How can I be of assistance?",
  "RohanPrakash_10037": "An excellent purchase.",
  "RohanPrakash_10038": "Thank you kindly for your business.",
  "RohanPrakash_10039": "I am afraid you will need deeper pockets for that.",
  "RohanPrakash_10040": "Thank you, I hope to see you again.",
  "RohanPrakash_10041": "Please, have a look.",
  "RohanPrakash_10042": "Excuse me.",
  "RohanPrakash_10043": "That is one way to relieve stress.",
  "Rooky_10020": "Feenky keeps all us house-elves in line here in the kitchen. It's all right, she's the kind-hearted sort.",
  "Rooky_10021": "Towards the other end of the kitchen. If it's not taken out yet,  just follow your nose. You'll find it soon enough.",
  "Rooky_10022": "A student? In the kitchen? What could they want?",
  "Rooky_10023": "Certainly makes Rooky's job easier. ",
  "RowlandOakes_10003": "If you could just find my wand, I'm sure I'd be able to thwart the enchantment they placed on this blasted cage.",
  "RowlandOakes_10022": "Having my wand back is like being reunited with an old friend.",
  "RowlandOakes_10023": "I must return home and inform Adelaide of my safety. Will you be all right?",
  "RowlandOakes_10036": "And I her. She's become quite savvy to my trading habits – always analysing my detailed owls.",
  "RowlandOakes_10037": "She was right to be. I couldn't go through with the agreement. And when I told them, I ended up blindfolded and behind bars.",
  "RowlandOakes_10041": "Help! Somebody! Anybody!",
  "RowlandOakes_10042": "I'll get you the metal that I promised you, but first you must let me out of here.",
  "RowlandOakes_10043": "I'm certain we can come to an agreement if you'll just set me free!",
  "RowlandOakes_10055": "Yes! I'm here!",
  "RowlandOakes_10056": "They've taken my wand!",
  "RowlandOakes_10057": "This cell has an enchanted lock. I have experience with these locks, but need my wand if I have any chance of opening it.",
  "RowlandOakes_10058": "You did it! Found my wand and – Wait –",
  "RowlandOakes_10063": "I'm anxious to see my dear niece, and then I plan to travel far from here for my next round of trading.",
  "RowlandOakes_10074": "You found it! Pass it to me! Hurry, before they come. I must get out, hurry!",
  "RowlandOakes_10075": "Please! Pass me my wand! I can't get out of this damned cell without it. It's my last hope. Please!",
  "RowlandOakes_10076": "My wand! Oh, thank Merlin! Thank you!",
  "RowlandOakes_10077": "Now, let's just hope this works or I'll spend the rest of my days rotting in this place!",
  "RowlandOakes_10078": "You're a student? We must get you to safety, immediately. It's dangerous – ",
  "RowlandOakes_10079": "Dear Merlin. You’re either very lucky or very talented. How did you find me?",
  "RowlandOakes_10081": "If only I could reward you for what you've done. Blasted goblins stole every Knut on me. All I can say is thank you. Truly.",
  "RowlandOakes_10082": "Been locked in that infernal cell for so long they'd forget I was even there. I – overheard things.",
  "RowlandOakes_10084": "A sad tale, really. I think I know where Ranrok's unfortunate vendetta against wizardkind began.",
  "RowlandOakes_10085": "If only I hadn't resorted to trading with such fiends. A lesson I shan't soon forget.",
  "RowlandOakes_10086": "Unbeknownst to Ranrok's fiends, I do. I've always had an affinity for goblin culture – knew I wanted to be a metal trader ever since I was a lad.",
  "RowlandOakes_10087": "It wasn't easy learning the language – it's complex and my memory's as weak as my knees these days.",
  "RowlandOakes_10088": "But after decades working with fine goblin folk, I grew fairly proficient. At least, I'd like to think so.",
  "RowlandOakes_10089": "Although dragon-breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks’ Convention of 1709, Ranrok stumbled upon an illegal dragon camp. He was young –",
  "RowlandOakes_10090": "The wizard happened to drop his wand; Ranrok saw an opportunity! He picked it up, went to hand it back as a means of introducing himself.",
  "RowlandOakes_10091": "The sight of a goblin with a wand sent the wizard into an instant rage. He beat Ranrok nearly to death.",
  "RowlandOakes_10092": "Ever since, Ranrok has despised wizardkind – sees us all as cruel.",
  "RowlandOakes_10096": "I can’t unlock the cage. I think it's enchanted, and they took my wand. Please find it. It may be behind the boiler door.",
  "RowlandOakes_10097": "Look for a boiler door. I've heard them speak of it.",
  "RowlandOakes_10098": "Infernal goblin cages, no key will unlock this. Please – find my wand. It's bound to be stowed somewhere.",
  "RowlandOakes_10099": "– found the creatures fascinating. He'd visit the camp in secret whenever he could, never making his presence known.",
  "RowlandOakes_10100": "After weeks of his sly surveillance, he finally summoned the courage to speak to the wizard in charge. Ranrok wanted to join them – and the creatures.",
  "RowlandOakes_10101": "Thank you. May life reward you justly for your deeds. Be well, my friend.",
  "RowlandOakes_10102": "Ever since, Ranrok has despised wizardkind.",
  "RunoCalhoun_10021": "Have you met Helen Thistlewood? Still has that spark of curiosity. Years of Auror work will do that.",
  "RuthSinger_10061": "Well, it's certainly a good start. We shall see. But you can leave this to me, now.",
  "RuthSinger_10064": "Cassandra.",
  "RuthSinger_10065": "Stop her!",
  "RuthSinger_10066": "It’s my understanding that you sold your shop – and your elf – to this student. Now, they've been telling me some very interesting stories about your business practices. Perhaps you should come with –",
  "RuthSinger_10067": "Ahh. I’m disappointed in you, Cassandra.",
  "RuthSinger_10068": "<i>Incarcerous!</i>",
  "RuthSinger_10069": "Thanks for this. You can head back to the shop. Check on that house-elf of yours. She’s probably terrified.",
  "RuthSinger_10070": "Don’t I? I always wondered why you couldn't keep a tenant in that shop of yours.",
  "RuthSinger_10071": "I must admit, the notion of a ‘haunted dungeon’ never crossed my mind.",
  "RuthSinger_10072": "<i>Silencio!</i>",
  "RuthSinger_10077": "No. No. I – I heard that bit too.",
  "RuthSinger_10078": "I – Cassandra Mason sold you her shop?",
  "RuthSinger_10079": "Hmm. I wondered what was going on. She seems to have had a great deal of trouble keeping a tenant in that shop.",
  "RuthSinger_10080": "Perhaps a little visit with Cassandra is in order to clear this all up. Shall we?",
  "RuthSinger_10081": "In any event, these are serious accusations, indeed.",
  "RuthSinger_10082": "Best of luck to you as the newest shop owner in Hogsmeade.",
  "RuthSinger_10083": "Oh, and, not to worry. Cassandra will immediately file the paperwork needed to grant you ownership of both the shop and the elf – on her way to Azkaban.",
  "RuthSinger_10084": "Ah. Good to see you again. What can I do for you?",
  "RuthSinger_10096": "Goodness! A second troll?",
  "RuthSinger_10104": "If you are unharmed, perhaps the two of you wouldn't mind helping me put a few things back to where they were.",
  "RuthSinger_10105": "Merlin's beard. Are you all right?",
  "RuthSinger_10107": "Singer. Officer Singer. And thank you. Again.",
  "RuthSinger_10108": "I'd say 'help' is a bit of an understatement. Nerve like that? The makings of an Auror, if you ask me.",
  "RuthSinger_10109": "Isko Rabe told me a couple of students had rescued him. Should've known it was you two.",
  "RuthSinger_10110": "He is. I sent him home to his wife.",
  "RuthSinger_10113": "I appreciate what you're trying to do, but you are taking great risk. Next time, please let the authorities handle the Ashwinders.",
  "RuthSinger_10115": "Natsai Onai. I should have known. And you – the troll dispatcher. Thank goodness the two of you are safe.",
  "RuthSinger_10116": "Natsai – you may wish to speak with your mother about this before I do.",
  "RuthSinger_10117": "Did you two take on a fully-grown troll – by yourselves?",
  "RuthSinger_10118": "There's more to taking down an organisation like the Ashwinders than simply storming in and hauling them off based on a few accusations.",
  "RuthSinger_10119": "I must insist that you leave them to us. We shall have no further discussion on this.",
  "RuthSinger_10121": "Miss Onai, your mother will not be pleased to learn that you're still risking your safety pursuing these dangerous men.",
  "RuthSinger_10123": "I will look into all of that. As for the two of you –",
  "RuthSinger_10124": "<i>Bombarda!</i>",
  "RuthSinger_10125": "Draw it away from the buildings! Away from the village!",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10000": "I do hope you've something for me.",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10001": "Splendid! I hope it wasn't too much trouble. May I have them?",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10002": "I suppose a higher price is less offensive than being forced to regard the hideous, greasy pustules plaguing our pubescent classmates.",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10003": "Thank you. And your payment, of course. Now I can begin perfecting my potion to save our poor, pimply peers.",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10004": "Don't know who should be more grateful – I or our unsightly spotty classmates.",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10005": "One day the wizarding world will know my name – and you will have been a small part of it!",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10006": "Pardon me. Might I ask a favour of you?",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10007": "How do you do? I'm Sacharissa Tugwood. And I have an exciting business proposition for you.",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10008": "Now, it may surprise you to learn that someone of my obvious esteemed lineage would be in 'business'.",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10009": "But – I only want to help the less fortunate.",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10010": "Oh, there's more! You see, I've been experimenting with a new beauty cream.",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10013": "Marvellous. I'd go myself, but, I don't want to.",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10014": "I only need a few Bubotubers, but they grow wild, so you'll have to look around.",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10017": "Our spotty classmates are counting on you, so you mustn't tarry.",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10018": "But – I've run out of the key ingredient: Bubotuber pus.",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10019": "A cream that will rid our glorious school of the hideous, greasy pustules plaguing our poor, pubescent classmates.",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10020": "Bubotubers do grow in the Forbidden Forest, however. If only I could pay someone to collect a few for me.",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10021": "I am convinced that beauty potions are the future. I'm forever looking for ways to make this world a more beautiful place.",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10022": "One cannot rely on spells for all appearance enhancements. The errant cast, for example, could relocate one's eyebrows entirely rather than merely thinning them.",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10023": "My darling and now perpetually surprised-looking neighbour discovered that on her own, poor thing.",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10024": "I suspected that if pure Bubotuber pus could cause boils, an altered form would likely reverse such abominations. And I was correct.",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10025": "Gather Bubotubers from the Forbidden Forest for my new pimple cream formula.",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10026": "Disgusting things, really. Covered in protrusions. One needs to squeeze them to collect the pus.",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10027": "They smell simply awful and seem to move on their own. I wouldn't go near the things, if it weren't for my devotion to my classmates.",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10028": "I do hope you've noticed how much more attractive our classmates have become. They've you to thank for that. Mostly me and my creams, but also you. A bit.",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10029": "A bit dangerous, if you ask me.",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10030": "Oh, my. I would never ride a Graphorn. Danger aside, they're simply filthy creatures.",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10031": "Someone riding a Hippogriff? How uncouth.",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10032": "That is not appropriate attire.",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10033": "Awful end to the year. I never even had the chance to take Fig's class. He did teach one, didn't he?",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10034": "Is it true that trolls attacked Hogsmeade? Thank goodness I wasn't there.",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10035": "I'm fortunate to have never been confronted by Ranrok's Loyalists. Likely they would've been intimidated.",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10036": "What sort of spell is that? Not a Dark one, is it?",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10037": "Mind you don't damage it – since you clearly don't have the key.",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10039": "That will be enough of that.",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10040": "Oh, dear. Thought you saw me.",
  "SacharissaTugwood_10041": "Well, aren't you the noisy one?",
  "SamanthaDale_10095": "Oh, but the curse only applies to Marmaduke's descendants – as my brother so aptly demonstrated.",
  "SamanthaDale_10099": "The curse is the result of an intense sibling rivalry between Granum Dale and his younger brother, Marmaduke.",
  "SamanthaDale_10100": "Years later, when Marmaduke died, Granum stole it and cursed the tomb so that none in the Dale family could ever pay their respects.",
  "SamanthaDale_10102": "And to prove his point he went right up to the entrance of the tomb – and poof! His feet transfigured into beets.",
  "SamanthaDale_10103": "And no one deserves such a fate to last forever. Especially as the result of a single, brainless mistake.",
  "SamanthaDale_10112": "That's why I need your help. You're unrelated to my family. So the curse wouldn't affect you.",
  "SamanthaDale_10116": "I cannot thank you enough. It wasn't too much trouble, I hope?",
  "SamanthaDale_10118": "A troll? Oh dear, I'm so sorry, that's awful! No one has been in that tomb for centuries.",
  "SamanthaDale_10119": "But I can't say I'm surprised. Marmaduke seems to have been full of surprises.",
  "SamanthaDale_10121": "Oh, it's you! Just the person I need!",
  "SamanthaDale_10128": "Thank you for your help. My family is indebted to you.",
  "SamanthaDale_10144": "Thank you again for what you did.",
  "SamanthaDale_10145": "No, no it's not. It's my brother, William.",
  "SamanthaDale_10149": "Hello there. You're the new student, aren't you?",
  "SamanthaDale_10156": "I'm sure I'll see you about the castle. Have a lovely day.",
  "SamanthaDale_10157": "Oh, it's you! Thank you again for agreeing to help my brother.",
  "SamanthaDale_10158": "My poor brother. He still has beets for feet.",
  "SamanthaDale_10164": "I don’t believe I’ll ever have much use for Bubotuber pus.",
  "SamanthaDale_10168": "That took some of the wind out of Sebastian's sails.",
  "SamanthaDale_10170": "Let's see, Grimbald Weft. I do so enjoy old stories. I'm sure he's around here somewhere.",
  "SamanthaDale_10171": "Up.",
  "SamanthaDale_10175": "I just don't know which is my favourite. Diricawls or Kneazles? They're both interesting-looking creatures, that's for sure.",
  "SamanthaDale_10179": "Hello.",
  "SamanthaDale_10181": "I won't even go into the attention he was getting from our garden rabbits before he admitted himself to hospital.",
  "SamanthaDale_10182": "I'm glad you understand. Everyone else just laughs at me as if it's a joke. No compassion at all.",
  "SamanthaDale_10183": "You and the entire school may find it funny but the situation is dire.",
  "SamanthaDale_10189": "I thought as much. I received word from St Mungo's that my brother's feet are back to normal! No more beets.",
  "SamanthaDale_10197": "No, no it's not. It's my brother, William. The one I told you about after Charms class.",
  "SamanthaDale_10200": "Now I worry that if the curse isn't reversed, it could become permanent.",
  "SamanthaDale_10204": "Samantha Dale – I've been eager to meet you. You're the student everyone's been whispering about.",
  "SamanthaDale_10206": "Well, I suppose I should be going. I'm anxious to see my brother – who must be elated to have his feet back.",
  "SamanthaDale_10211": "I've been wanting to talk to you.",
  "SamanthaDale_10216": "Oh, William – you absolute moonmind.",
  "SamanthaDale_10217": "This is a disaster.",
  "SamanthaDale_10218": "He should have known better! Complete nincompoop.",
  "SamanthaDale_10221": "There you are! Do you have any news of Marmaduke's crest?",
  "SamanthaDale_10223": "Possibly. The curse stems from a crest that was stolen from Marmaduke. If the crest were returned to its rightful place upon his sarcophagus then I believe that William's feet may be restored.",
  "SamanthaDale_10224": "You battled trolls when they attacked Hogsmeade, escaped a dragon, and I could tell by your work in Charms that you're a skilled spellcaster.",
  "SamanthaDale_10225": "You'll simply go into the tomb where Marmaduke was laid to rest and place the crest on top of his sarcophagus.",
  "SamanthaDale_10226": "According to my research, the tomb's been abandoned for centuries so it should be a fairly simple task.",
  "SamanthaDale_10227": "But I would never intentionally curse my brother – not like Granum did.",
  "SamanthaDale_10229": "He discovered the properties of several magical herbs and plants. He also uncovered numerous types of flora.",
  "SamanthaDale_10230": "The wizarding world owes him a great debt. His work not only impacted the discipline of Herbology, but also potion-making.",
  "SamanthaDale_10232": "He – he's been cursed. He ignored my warning and now he's lying in St Mungo's looking completely pathetic.",
  "SamanthaDale_10233": "He simply never listens.",
  "SamanthaDale_10234": "Exactly. He may be a capeflapper but he's still my brother.",
  "SamanthaDale_10235": "Normally, I'd agree with you but he's my brother. I know what he did showed abysmal judgement on his part.",
  "SamanthaDale_10236": "Marmaduke was a famed herbologist and Granum resented the attention that he received.",
  "SamanthaDale_10237": "When their mother died, Marmaduke was given the prized family crest. Granum felt that as the eldest child he should have been given it.",
  "SamanthaDale_10241": "Returning a crest to a sarcophagus should be almost effortless for you. So – will you help us?",
  "SamanthaDale_10243": "Oh, thank you! Thank you so much.",
  "SamanthaDale_10245": "Oh, what I wouldn't give to have a space of my own. Sharing a dormitory all year has been simply miserable.",
  "SamanthaDale_10246": "William and I are forever in your debt.",
  "SamanthaDale_10265": "I want him to be in the perfect place. A place he’ll be happy with. But I can’t seem to find it.",
  "SamanthaDale_10266": "I'm not sure this is the right spot.",
  "SamanthaDale_10267": "Hm, that's not right either.",
  "SamanthaDale_10268": "Great golden Gobstones. I want him to thrive here.",
  "SamanthaDale_10270": "Oh, it's you!",
  "SamanthaDale_10271": "Up for a game?",
  "SamanthaDale_10272": "I am. I'm actually rather good at it. Used to play all the time with my brother, until – never mind.",
  "SamanthaDale_10273": "Then let's get summoning.",
  "SamanthaDale_10274": "Of course, another time.",
  "SamanthaDale_10275": "After your poor show against Natty in class, I thought I could beat you. Appears I overestimated myself.",
  "SamanthaDale_10276": "Fair enough, but a little sporting spirit wouldn't hurt you.",
  "SamanthaDale_10277": "Well that's very kind of you. Let's just say if I'm good then you're better.",
  "SamanthaDale_10278": "I happen to know who you're up against next, and she's no shy opponent. Best of luck!",
  "SamanthaDale_10279": "Good match! Care to have another go?",
  "SamanthaDale_10280": "Splendid.",
  "SamanthaDale_10281": "Suit yourself. I shall be here when you're ready.",
  "SamanthaDale_10282": "My brother William would tell you not to be so humble and to trust your abilities. Then again, he tends to be overconfident in his.",
  "SamanthaDale_10283": "That's not what I needed.",
  "SamanthaDale_10284": "You'll have to do better than that.",
  "SamanthaDale_10285": "What was I thinking?",
  "SamanthaDale_10286": "Yes!",
  "SamanthaDale_10287": "Might you be able to move a bit more quickly?",
  "SamanthaDale_10288": "That settles it, then.",
  "SamanthaDale_10289": "How about that. I won!",
  "SamanthaDale_10290": "A draw? That simply won't do. A rematch, then.",
  "SamanthaDale_10291": "How am I to top that?",
  "SamanthaDale_10292": "<i>Accio!</i>",
  "SamanthaDale_10293": "Yes? Care to play a round?",
  "SamanthaDale_10294": "I'll try not to beat you too badly this time. Ready?",
  "SamanthaDale_10295": "Oh, my.",
  "SamanthaDale_10296": "Unfortunate for me.",
  "SamanthaDale_10297": "My own little expression. I brought this dittany seedling from home and I so want him to feel cosy.",
  "SamanthaDale_10304": "Thank you! And good luck to you too, on your first day!",
  "SamanthaDale_10310": "Ordinarily, perhaps, but it runs in my family. We've a full plot of these little fellows back home.",
  "SamanthaDale_10311": "I suppose you could say Herbology is in my roots.",
  "SamanthaDale_10312": "You won't believe it. Truly. But – his feet were turned into purple beets! You can imagine his distress – and mine!",
  "SamanthaDale_10313": "It's entirely his own fault. I told him about some research I'd done recently on our ancestor, Marmaduke Dale. In particular, my discovery that Marmaduke's tomb was cursed.",
  "SamanthaDale_10314": "My brother's always making fun of my discoveries. This time, he laughed in my face. Told me I'd misinterpreted my findings. As if that were possible.",
  "SamanthaDale_10315": "How am I meant to concentrate on potions when Professor Sharp is so intimidating?",
  "SamanthaDale_10316": "Oh – the smell!",
  "SamanthaDale_10317": "Fine job brewing your first Wiggenweld Potion, but there are many potions yet to learn. This is going to be a busy year.",
  "SamanthaDale_10318": "Well done beating Ronen. You certainly know your way around the Summoning Charm!",
  "SamanthaDale_10319": "Shall we begin?",
  "SamanthaDale_10320": "Pleased to me you. I'm Samantha. Looking forward to beating you at Summoner's Court today.",
  "SamanthaDale_10323": "That was sensational!",
  "SamanthaDale_10324": " I've a bit of a thing for plants, as you can see. Pleased to meet you. I'm Samantha.",
  "SamanthaDale_10325": "I am. I'm hoping to get my brother out here soon too since, thanks to you, he's recovered from his, er, vegetative state.",
  "SamanthaDale_10326": "In all fairness, I must warn you that I'm frightfully good.",
  "SamanthaDale_10327": "Dittany is amazing, isn't it? So much healing power in such a little plant.",
  "SamanthaDale_10328": "It is! Looks like someone's been studying up on their Potion-making.",
  "SamanthaDale_10329": "Of course. I heard you were studying with him before term.",
  "SamanthaDale_10330": "He's an enigma, Fig. Teaches about theory yet seems to know a lot about practical magic.",
  "SamanthaDale_10331": "Well, I hope he told you about more than Wiggenweld. You've lots to catch up on, I'm sure!",
  "SamanthaDale_10332": "Oh yes! In fact, our Herbology teacher, Professor Garlick, encourages it.",
  "SamanthaDale_10333": "And I don't think Professor Sharp – our Potions master – cares where you get your ingredients as long as your brews are all perfect.",
  "SamanthaDale_10334": "Hello! How is your first day coming along?",
  "SamanthaDale_10335": "I wondered how your first day was going. You certainly seemed to hold your own in Charms.",
  "SamanthaDale_10336": "Hope your first day's going well. You certainly seemed to hold your own in Charms.",
  "SamanthaDale_10337": "Well, better see to my Charms homework. I'm afraid I can't count on 'beginner's luck' to impress Professor Ronen.",
  "SamanthaDale_10338": "My brother William would tell you not to be so humble and to trust your abilities. Then again, he tends to be a bit overconfident in his.",
  "SamanthaDale_10339": "Well, better see to my Charms homework. I find Professor Ronen's lessons a bit more challenging than you do.",
  "SamanthaDale_10340": "Some of us don't necessarily want him to get back to the lesson.",
  "SamanthaDale_10341": "You'll find it just east of the hamlet of Brocburrow.",
  "SamanthaDale_10342": "You were going into the tomb east of Brocburrow where my ancestor was laid to rest. There you were to place a crest upon his sarcophagus.",
  "SamanthaDale_10343": "I'm hoping that will reverse the curse that has turned my brother's feet to beets.",
  "SamanthaDale_10344": "My brother's doing well, thanks to you. And he listens to me now. Turns out having beets for feet teaches a memorable lesson.",
  "SamanthaDale_10345": "That's quite enough, don't you think.",
  "SamanthaDale_10346": "I ought to do the same. It's been a while since I hopped on my broom.",
  "SamanthaDale_10347": "Don't know if riding a Graphorn is the most inspired idea.",
  "SamanthaDale_10348": "Hippogriffs are such beautiful beasts.",
  "SamanthaDale_10349": "Great golden Gobstones! What are you wearing?",
  "SamanthaDale_10350": "Poor Professor Fig – and to think Hogwarts was supposed to be safe.",
  "SamanthaDale_10351": "Won't be setting foot in Hogsmeade after that troll attack.",
  "SamanthaDale_10352": "Good riddance to Ranrok and his Loyalists.",
  "SamanthaDale_10353": "Just so you know, I'm beating you at Summoner's Court next year.",
  "SamanthaDale_10354": "Oh, never that. What are you doing?",
  "SamanthaDale_10355": "Doing well. You'll get it.",
  "SamanthaDale_10357": "I'd prefer it if you stopped that.",
  "SamanthaDale_10358": "Great golden Gobstones!",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_00031": "(frustrated grunt)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_00034": "(dying sound)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_00036": "(pained yell)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_00037": "(pained grunt)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_00041": "(surprised sound)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_00044": "(surprised gasp)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_00052": "(pained grunt)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_00054": "(pained grunt)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_00058": "(surprised sound)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_00059": "(amazed sound)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_00068": "(effort sound)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_00081": "(chuckle)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_00083": "(laughing)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_00085": "(celebratory sound)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_00095": "(relieved sigh)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_00118": "(confused sound)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_00137": "(disgusted sound)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_00138": "(snoring)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_00145": "(pained grunt)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_00149": "(worried sound)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_00150": "(laughing)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_00152": "(disappointed sound)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_00155": "(pleased sound)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_00156": "(pleased sound)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_00157": "(annoyed sound)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_00167": "(curious sound)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_00168": "(bored sound)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_00169": "(yawn)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_00172": "(effort sound)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_00173": "(effort sound)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_00174": "(effort sound)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10000": "Of course. What sort of overall look most appeals to you?",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10001": "Sounds perfect.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10103": "Approach the Puffskeins carefully. Then open the nab-sack, and in they'll go.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10104": "Where are you going?",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10161": "Oh my. Deek was afraid of this. Alone in that cave for so long. Poor Tobbs.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10164": "Wonderful! Deek hopes you gave Deek's best to Tobbs.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10247": "Apologies, Professor Weasley. Deek was looking through some of what's appeared in the Room since Deek was last here.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10249": "Deek is honoured to meet you.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10250": "Of course, Professor Weasley.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10259": "Hello. How may Deek be of help?",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10314": "It seems to be a place for your beasts to live. A vivarium of some sort.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10316": "Hmm?",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10317": "Oh! There you are!",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10318": "Wait right there! Deek will come to you.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10319": "(grunts)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10320": "Hello!",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10334": "Of course. What sort of overall look most appeals to you?",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10335": "Sounds perfect.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10339": "When you have a moment, please come and talk to Deek.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10340": "Spare a moment? Deek has an idea to share with you.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10341": "Deek would like to speak with you – when you have a moment.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10342": "Indeed. Deek thought you might want to learn how to build a breeding pen – so that you can breed beasts.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10348": "Then you'll need to purchase a spellcraft for the pen from Tomes and Scrolls and gather the materials it requires.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10349": "Once you've rescued the Thestrals and you have the spellcraft, you come and find Deek.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10368": "How wonderful to have more Thestrals in our world. Such misunderstood beasts.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10420": "Did you find the phoenix?",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10423": "Remarkable. Well, what are you waiting for? Deek cannot wait to –",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10430": "Now, it's time to focus on what you need.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10431": "Just close your eyes –",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10432": "Imagine the Room precisely as you need it.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10433": "The Room will do the rest.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10436": "You got one!",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10449": "Look at this! It's amazing!",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10482": "The Room of Requirement will always be equipped for the seeker's needs.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10503": "My heavens –",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10504": "What a beauty. You keep it close.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10514": "Deek has seen one of these before. Deek calls it a 'nab-sack'.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10515": "Perfect for gathering and transporting beasts.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10516": "Pleasant little breeze.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10518": "There you are.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10519": "Now, we need to show the beasts you rescued their new home.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10520": "But – hmm. Not enough room to let them out here.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10521": "Imagine all those beasts running amok. That wouldn't do at all.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10522": "Perhaps if you focus on what your beasts need, the Room will provide.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10523": "Hmm. What exactly did you think of?",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10524": "Heavens!",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10525": "You've done it!",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10526": "Deek isn't sure. Only one way to find out.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10527": "Meet you inside when you're ready.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10533": "Come along, then.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10549": "But do be careful. As Deek said, poachers will most certainly be looking for it.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10572": "Deek will miss his friend dearly, and will raise a glass to him with a heavy heart. ",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10584": "Thank you. You are very kind.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10585": "Deek could use some time alone to think, if that's all right.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10592": "What about the room, Professor?",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10595": "Deek's seen students in need of an extra phial for Potions stumble upon the Room filled with them.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10598": "Your beasts have been cooped up in the nab-sack for quite some time. Why don't you let them out?",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10599": "Over here.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10600": "Hello. This way.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10601": "Oh, excuse Deek.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10604": "Now, not all beasts will be as simple to rescue as a Puffskein. Deek suggests you next find a beast that can fly. A Jobberknoll, perhaps?",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10605": "Deek knows of some to the west, nesting in a large tree overlooking Hogwarts. But we must be careful. Deek has seen poachers in the area recently.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10615": "It is. Mooncalves gather near the large tree with the spiral pattern in front, but only under the light of the moon.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10634": "Deek enjoys coming here to watch the beasts – especially the poffle of Puffskeins nearby.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10641": "First, get close to the beast you wish to rescue.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10642": "Then point the mouth of the bag directly at the beast and open it. The beast should go right in.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10663": "Beasts won't stray too far from their homes. Look nearby or simply wait a moment and they should return.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10670": "Perhaps we should work quickly. The Jobberknolls are just here, in this large tree.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10671": "Good luck. Deek will be waiting.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10675": "Deek hopes your Jobberknoll finds the nab-sack nice and cosy.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10680": "Just one that Deek knows of – a herd of Mooncalves. They live in a clearing of trees up this footpath.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10681": "Deek will see you there.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10696": "You should try to find a Mooncalf. Since they only come out at night, you may have to wait a little while, depending upon what time it is.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10702": "Another beast safe and sound.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10710": "All your beasts will be quite comfortable here. They'll live healthy, safe lives.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10712": "Perhaps you want to release them? Let them see their new home.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10729": "That was a dark time in Deek's life.  Deek found himself in service of the cruellest wizard he ever met.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10730": "A nasty poacher. Deek hated working for him. He did horrible things to beautiful beasts. (shiver)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10731": "It was during those days that Deek first saw a nab-sack. It'll be nice to see one used for good.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10737": "Well, then – the Room can provide you with precisely that.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10741": "If it's helpful, Deek has seen <i>Levioso</i> used to slow flying beasts. Easier to get in close and use the nab-sack.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10747": "Wonderful. Then Deek supposes you're finished here.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10750": "Deek will be waiting for your return.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10760": "Ah, Deek is so happy to see you. Deek noticed this bag in the Room the other day. You must need it to help with your schoolwork.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10771": "Professor Weasley and Deek were right to tell you about the Room of Requirement.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10776": "Oh, good. Deek was worried about you, what with all the poachers in the area.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10779": "So, unfortunately, unless you have a way to hasten time, you might sometimes have to wait until nightfall to see them.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10780": "Our first stop will be beyond the castle grounds. We can leave now, or you can come and find Deek when you're ready to go.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10781": "Perfect. Deek loves an outing.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10788": "Rescuing and breeding beasts go hand-in-hand. Young beasts are particularly vulnerable to poachers.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10792": "Deek would not doubt it. If Deek has heard of it, surely the nasty poachers have as well. Which means it could be in danger.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10816": "Deek is grateful for the kind words and – also grateful to have been of assistance to someone like yourself.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10817": "Deek will always be here for you when you need him.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10825": "Noble creatures, but their relationship with death gives them a bad reputation. They're prized by poachers for their tail hairs.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10830": "First, bring a pair of beasts to the room; one male, one female. Deek suggests rescuing Thestrals, as they're at great risk from poachers.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10831": "Excellent! Now, to breed your Thestrals, simply release them into the same vivarium in which you conjure the pen.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10833": "Deek never grows tired of the Room's surprises. We now have the perfect place for those Thestrals.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10834": "Please let Deek know once you've bred them.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10839": "You're doing well breeding beasts.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10858": "Professor Weasley showed Deek this bit of magic some years ago. Deek thinks you'll enjoy it.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10859": "Come and talk to Deek when you're ready.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10860": "Deek thinks the vivarium will be a fitting new home for your beasts.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10862": "Yes. She's well-known for helping to care for beasts in need – and she'll give you a fair price for them.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10869": "It would be good to feed and groom a Jobberknoll if you haven't yet.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10870": "Deek recommends feeding and grooming one of your Jobberknolls whenever you can.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10871": "Your Jobberknoll must be fed and groomed if it's going to provide you with magical materials.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10872": "Ah! Seems the Room thinks you need more space for your beasts.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10873": "As Deek was saying – he's had a thought. Deek knows how you can test the item of clothing that you enhanced in the Enchanted Loom –",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10874": "A house-elf named Tobbs works for his master retrieving Leech Juice in a cave near Hogwarts.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10875": "Tobbs's master doesn't let him leave the cave, and Deek knows the cave is infested with spiders.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10876": "It is. Deek hasn't heard from his friend for a while now.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10879": "What do you need to know?",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10880": "Wonderful. Good luck!",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10881": "Simply use the skills you learned in Beasts class.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10882": "Feeding your beasts or grooming them with a brush will make them happier.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10886": "Now Deek can show you how to use them!",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10887": "First, you'll need to use this spellcraft to conjure an Enchanted Loom.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10888": "Exactly. It will allow you to use your magical materials to weave magic into the very threads of your clothing –",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10893": "The sooner you conjure the Enchanted Loom, the sooner you can weave magic into your clothing.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10894": "You should have all you need to conjure the Enchanted Loom.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10895": "Deek looks forward to seeing what you can do with the Enchanted Loom once you've conjured it.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10901": "Deek is excited to see what the Enchanted Loom will do.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10902": "Deek will be here, waiting to see what the Enchanted Loom can do.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10903": "Deek hopes you'll be able to use the Enchanted Loom soon.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10906": "The Loom will only enhance clothing of a certain quality.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10909": "Wonderful.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10917": "Of course, Professor Weasley.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10918": "Ah, hello. Yes. About that. Deek has had a thought. He – ",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10921": "Have you rescued the Thestrals and purchased the spellcraft for the breeding pen?",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10923": "Are you ready to breed your beasts?",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10924": "After you conjure the pen you should be able to use it to breed your new Thestrals.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10926": "Simply approach a happy beast and they'll provide you with any magical materials they can.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10929": "Deek would like to talk with you when you have a moment.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10930": "Tobbs's cave shouldn't be terribly far from here. Deek has marked the area on your map.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10931": "Do you have news of Tobbs?",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10932": "Deek has some exciting news to share.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10933": "For now, however, Deek suggests you explore the vivarium and get to know the beasts you've already rescued.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10934": "Deek can help with that once he is back in the Room. For now, let's finish learning about beasts.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10938": "If you gather some magical materials from your beasts, Deek can show you how to use them.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10939": "Only a happy beast will produce such materials.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10941": "– making your clothing more useful in a variety of ways.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10942": "Why don't you try it? Deek thinks you'll be impressed with what the Loom can do.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10943": "Come back to Deek once you've enhanced a piece of clothing.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10944": "Deek suspects you'll find more valuable clothing as you explore.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10946": "Oh, thank you. Please let Deek know what you learn about Deek's old friend.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10947": "Deek understands.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10950": "Deek has seen some wild Thestrals not too far from the Hogwarts grounds.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10956": "Perhaps you should try with the Thestrals you rescued.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10963": "They have a variety of uses – all of which help to make a witch or wizard more powerful.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10964": "Deek's friend Tobbs collects Leech Juice from a spider-infested cave near Hogwarts, but Deek hasn't heard from Tobbs in a while.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10965": "Is this the student?",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10968": "Deek will meet you there whenever you're ready.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10969": "<i>Levioso</i> is not only helpful when rescuing flying beasts, it can also help rescue beasts that are generally hard to catch.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10970": "Try using that spell the next time you encounter a small or otherwise elusive beast.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10971": "Deek's master was not kind to beasts – or to Deek. He saw beasts only as a source of income –",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10972": "But Deek is grateful to be at Hogwarts, where he can help care for beasts and make amends for the things his master made him do.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10974": "Deek was the most fortunate one as Deek was sent to Hogwarts. Deek's friends were not as fortunate.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10975": "Deek's prior master had no family. So, when he died, all of his house-elves were relocated by the Ministry.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10976": "Deek thinks it might be easier to show you once you have some materials to work with.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10977": "It's quite easy.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10978": "Deek also knows that some of the shops in Hogsmeade can provide you with a variety of clothing for you to enhance.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10979": "– to be used for potion ingredients and labour and – Deek will not say more.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10980": "– and perhaps help an old friend in the process.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10993": "Use the spellcraft to conjure an Enchanted Loom. Then you'll be able to weave your magical materials into your clothing.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10995": "Indeed Deek does! Deek knows that you want to learn about all sorts of beasts – and Deek recently heard rumours of a phoenix nest in a nearby mountain!",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10996": "Deek thinks so. So majestic a beast should not fall into such vile hands.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10997": "Deek is not sure why, but Deek feels that saving a phoenix might help to make amends for what happened with Deek's prior master.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10998": "Look at all you've done – and how many beasts you've rescued. A phoenix is safe now. Because of you.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_10999": "Then use the pen to start the process. Come and see Deek when you're finished.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11000": "Deek and Tobbs once shared the same master. When he – died – we were separated.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11006": "You will. By rescuing even more powerful beasts.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11007": "Rescue a pair of Thestrals; one male and one female, and bring them to the Room.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11008": "Deek does. A clearing nearby is home to a herd of Mooncalves.  Just follow the footpath uphill and Deek will meet you there.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11012": "Deek will meet you back in the Room whenever you’re ready.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11014": "You seem to have accessed it in its form as the Room of Hidden Things.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11015": "That explains it, then.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11016": "Poachers capture Puffskeins and – well, Deek isn't sure what they do with them. Deek is certain they will be safer with you.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11023": "Poachers want them for their feathers –and are not kind when they gather them.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11024": "Shame we didn't see the Mooncalves dancing. It's a marvellous sight.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11025": "Speaking of care, beasts that are well-fed and groomed will provide you with valuable 'magical materials' – such as Puffskein hair, for example.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11026": "Deek hopes so too. But, if you do run out of room, Madam Peck at Brood and Peck in Hogsmeade will help to find safe homes for them.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11028": "You'll be able to rescue many more beasts – but for now, let's bring the ones you've gathered back to the Room.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11029": "Deek supposes you're finished here.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11030": "Precisely what Deek was thinking.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11031": "You see? The Room knew exactly what you needed. And, luckily, Deek can show you how to best use the nab-sack – and where.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11032": "We have arrived.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11033": "All you will need to do is get close, direct the open nab-sack toward the Puffskein, and in it'll go.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11034": "You'll be able to rescue many more beasts – but for now, let's bring the ones you've gathered back to the Room.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11035": "Deek will meet you back in the Room whenever you’re ready.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11037": "(excited chuckle)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11038": "(gasp)",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11039": "Deek believes it is worth the risk. So majestic a beast should not fall into such vile hands.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11040": "Of course – Deek has heard rumours of a phoenix nest on a nearby mountain top.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11041": "Deek hopes that you are able to find the phoenix and bring it to the Room, where it will be safe.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11042": "Helping you do such good for so many beasts has given Deek a sense of peace Deek hasn't known in years.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11044": "Breeding beasts here in the Room will allow us to keep the younger ones safe.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11046": "Deek is privileged to see such majestic beasts – but sometimes wishes Deek couldn't. Deek is to blame.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11047": "Years ago, Deek's master ordered Deek to help him capture a phoenix – the rarest of all beasts – that Master had spotted high on a cliff.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11048": "The phoenix was the most beautiful beast Deek had ever seen. Deek begged Master to leave her be.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11049": "When Deek hesitated to climb up the cliff as ordered, Deek had to punish himself.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11050": "Deek suspects the phoenix was protecting eggs when it swooped down in fear and fury. Before Deek could reach him, Master fell from the cliff.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11051": "Deek feels fortunate to be at Hogwarts now, helping you rescue beasts. Perhaps Deek can make amends for what came before.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11052": "As Deek punished himself, Master grew angrier and angrier – and in his frustration, cast at the regal bird.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11053": "Deek often wonders what became of that phoenix.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11054": "Deek never wanted anyone to get hurt – not the phoenix, not Tobbs, and not even Master.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11055": "Deek has only told Professor Weasley that story – and now yourself.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11056": "Deek stayed on that cliffside for days punishing himself before Tobbs found him.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11057": "Release them into the same vivarium in which you conjure the pen.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11058": "It will be nice to keep them safe.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11059": "You can rescue as many as the nab-sack will hold.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11060": "Deek suggests you rescue a Jobberknoll and then come and find Deek.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11061": "Deek always wished Tobbs had been sent to Hogwarts too. Deek feels lucky to serve such kind witches and wizards, like you.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11062": "As the item you wove in the Loom has an enchantment that might be useful, Deek thought you could test it whilst checking on Tobbs.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11063": "It's unplottable, so won't appear on any map.  Most happen upon it by accident – if ever.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11064": "As the item you wove in the Loom has an enchantment that might be useful, Deek thought you could test it whilst checking on Tobbs.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11068": "It warms Deek's heart to see a student so – comfortable.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11069": "Deek had hoped Professor Fig would be around for much, much longer.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11070": "Deek is glad no students were harmed by those trolls. Glad indeed.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11071": "Deek is glad that Hogwarts is still standing. This is Deek's home.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11073": "Deek thinks you should be proud of all the potions you've brewed.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11074": "Oh dear. Deek has seen the things that that spell can do.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11076": "Deek thinks you've made marvellous improvements here.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11077": "Oh dear. Deek thinks perhaps you didn't know Deek was near.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11078": "Deek hasn't seen this many plants here before.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11079": "Deek cannot believe how many beasts you have here.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11080": "Deek thinks some of the beasts in the nab-sack might like to stretch their legs.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11081": "Deek wonders if you'd like to let the beasts out now or later?",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11082": "Deek is curious when you'll show your rescued beasts their new home?",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11083": "Deek's no Herbology professor, but some plants here seem to be ready to harvest.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11086": "Hm – Deek believes there are many potions here that are ready to be used.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11087": "Deek thinks you might want to take some potions with you. To be well prepared.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11088": "Deek thinks some of these potions might serve you better outside of this room.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11089": "Deek suspects you have enough to make more magical clothing, if you'd like.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11090": "Deek wonders if you'll be making more magical clothing. Deek's seen you have a knack for it.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11091": "Deek wishes he had a loom to make magical clothing. Not for himself of course.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11092": "Wonderful!",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11093": "Deek thinks you are doing good work here.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11094": "Most excellent!",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11095": "Deek thinks you've become most adept at using the loom.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11096": "Deek feels as if a part of him is missing without his Tobbs.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11097": "Poor Tobbs. Stuck in that cave. No Deek to talk to.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11098": "Pardon Deek.",
  "SanctuaryHouseElf_11099": "Then use the pen to start the process. Come and see Deek when you're finished.",

  "SatyavatiShah_10942": "Ladies –",
  "SatyavatiShah_10943": "Astronomy is not Divination. You won’t find the mysteries of the cosmos charted out on your palms, or at the bottom of your teacups.",
  "SatyavatiShah_10944": "Alas, the heavens remain hazy to the starry-eyed.",
  "SatyavatiShah_10945": "Now if you were to devote yourselves to persistent and painstaking observation, you just might catch a glimpse.",
  "SatyavatiShah_10946": "Still don't have your own? You can't be the new student forever, you know. You can share with – Mr Thakkar.",
  "SatyavatiShah_10947": "No, no. Bring it into focus. On your own.",
  "SatyavatiShah_10948": "Now, I expect all of you to put in your stargazing hours outside of class. Is that clear?",
  "SatyavatiShah_10949": "Mere cold didn't stop the great stargazers of the past.",
  "SatyavatiShah_10950": "Look only to the Astronomy Tables they erected throughout the Highlands, from which they gazed, millennia ago, on the very selfsame stars above us.",
  "SatyavatiShah_10951": " Dismissed.",
  "SatyavatiShah_10952": "Is that clear?",
  "SatyavatiShah_10953": "With that in mind, please take your telescopes – tonight we will be on the observation deck.",
  "SatyavatiShah_10955": "We, ourselves, are not unlike blank star charts, you know. Empty canvases waiting to be inscribed with all that the universe has to offer. Do you understand?",
  "SatyavatiShah_10964": "Long ago, devotees of the astral arts set up stone slabs across the countryside. They are ideal for studying constellations near and far.",
  "SatyavatiShah_10966": "Of the many other 'so-called' disciplines taught here, Divination is perhaps the most feeble. Especially in its nonsensical practice of Astrology.",
  "SatyavatiShah_10969": "For centuries, wizards made use of these 'Astronomy Tables' for stargazing.",
  "SatyavatiShah_10970": "Sadly, they have since become mere monuments to the intrepid intellectual pursuits of a bygone epoch.",
  "SatyavatiShah_10972": "Do not confuse Astronomy and Astrology – one is concerned with mysteries stellar and lunar, the other is mere lunacy.",
  "SatyavatiShah_10981": "It is increasingly rare to find a student who seeks after things celestial – of their own accord.",
  "SatyavatiShah_10983": "But if you truly desire to chart the courses of the cosmos, you must rid your mind of the terrestrial babble of others.",
  "SatyavatiShah_11078": "A pristine night for stargazing. Do not let it be wasted.",
  "SatyavatiShah_11166": "I am glad to hear it. Should be a stellar night for it.",
  "SatyavatiShah_11196": "I do.",
  "SatyavatiShah_11197": "Now, off you go. I am sure you've a star chart to review somewhere.",
  "SatyavatiShah_11198": "(sigh) My sister is a Squib. Clever, hard-working, and generous – but a Squib nonetheless.",
  "SatyavatiShah_11199": "Suit yourself.",
  "SatyavatiShah_11200": "Misperceptions frequently arise due to the confusion of Astronomy with Astrology, the ridiculousness of which I shall not deign to discuss.",
  "SatyavatiShah_11201": "You may. Might I assume from your inquiry that you wonder how anyone may have an interest in Astronomy?",
  "SatyavatiShah_11202": "We still sneak up to a rooftop now and then to gaze upwards. Courtesy of a Levitation Charm rather than a trellis, nowadays.",
  "SatyavatiShah_11203": "I was glad to. It is good to be reminded of all that one can accomplish when one embraces who one is.",
  "SatyavatiShah_11204": "Ah. That is good to hear. So often those who do not fully understand all that can be gleaned from the stars question Astronomy's relevance.",
  "SatyavatiShah_11205": "I fear such a perspective is far too common among those who do not fully understand all that can be gleaned from the stars.",
  "SatyavatiShah_11206": "And, as Astronomy is one subject shared between the Muggle world and ours, she and I have been able to maintain that common interest.",
  "SatyavatiShah_11207": "Mm. Yes. However, to her credit, while she was once disappointed not to attend Hogwarts, she has excelled in Muggle school.",
  "SatyavatiShah_11208": "She is. And, to her credit, while she was once disappointed not to attend Hogwarts, she has excelled in Muggle school.",
  "SatyavatiShah_11209": "The only non-magical child born to our family in generations, poor thing. Although she manages exceptionally well.",
  "SatyavatiShah_11210": "The two of us spent countless nights on our rooftop staring at the cosmos. It was one of the only subjects we could study together.",
  "SatyavatiShah_11211": "To answer your question, it was my dear sister who first sparked my interest in stargazing.",
  "SatyavatiShah_11212": "One of the first women, we suspect, to have attended Cambridge. Well-disguised at the time by our mother as a gentleman scholar.",
  "SatyavatiShah_11246": "Forgotten your clothes! Hurrying to see the night sky, no doubt.",
  "SatyavatiShah_11248": "What a tragedy. Professor Fig was a good man.",
  "SatyavatiShah_11249": "Trolls in Hogsmeade! My stars, what is the world coming to?",
  "SatyavatiShah_11250": "Hogwarts is my home. Ranrok's Loyalists had no right.",
  "SatyavatiShah_11251": "I had heard about your Field Guide. It took both initiative and intelligence to complete it. Very good.",
  "SatyavatiShah_11252": "I had no idea you would take such initiative with the Astronomy Tables. Most exemplary.",
  "SatyavatiShah_11253": "I see you spend time with Mr Thakkar; I trust you are not discouraging his enthusiasm for Astronomy.",
  "SatyavatiShah_11254": "I have no tolerance for the Dark Arts!",
  "SatyavatiShah_11256": "What you did for Hogwarts was invaluable. All of us owe you a great debt.",
  "SatyavatiShah_11257": "I would mind where I directed that spell.",
  "SatyavatiShah_11258": "Careful now.",
  "SatyavatiShah_11259": "Fortunate we are that the stars lie not in your path.",
  "Scrope_10051": "The Blacks have a tradition of decapitating their house-elves when their service is no longer required.",
  "Scrope_10052": "Scrope was able to convince the sweet girl of his value and now views this small injury as a reminder of her good heart.",
  "Scrope_10057": "Greetings, master.",
  "Scrope_10059": "Take this toast to the grotto just down the coast. Place it on the pedestal there.",
  "Scrope_10060": "But master made Scrope swear never to tell anyone. Even master himself.",
  "Scrope_10061": "It is the Black family motto, Master.",
  "Scrope_10062": "Er, yes sir. Of course, sir. Scrope begs forgiveness.",
  "Scrope_10063": "Master does remember it – ?",
  "Scrope_10064": "Master has made Scrope laugh.",
  "Scrope_10065": "Is Master giving Scrope a test?",
  "Scrope_10066": "Er, close, Master. Scrope thinks master is indeed testing Scrope. It is 'always pure.'",
  "Scrope_10067": "Oh! Apollonia's diary –  That is quite a surprise, Master. What do you wish Scrope to do with this treasure – er, rubbish?",
  "Scrope_10068": "Of course, sir. Scrope shall try his best to keep out of Master's way.",
  "Scrope_10075": "One day, dear Apollonia was understandably frustrated with Scrope and got a bit too eager with a cleaver.",
  "Scrope_10079": "Wait until master sees what a wonderful job Scrope is doing.",
  "Scrope_10080": "Professor Black is happy with Scrope's performance as his house-elf. There's no doubt in Scrope's mind.",
  "Scrope_10083": "Scrope's as hard a worker as any house-elf.",
  "Scrope_10090": "Thank you for coming all this way.",
  "Scrope_10091": "Greetings, young Slytherin. Scrope knows about the old book you found for Professor Fig.",
  "Scrope_10092": "The name's Scrope. Scrope serves the Headmaster. Been in the Black family for years.",
  "Scrope_10093": "Oh, Scrope does not intend to undermine the Headmaster. In fact, Scrope wants to surprise him.",
  "Scrope_10095": "Scrope believes that a treasured Black family ring is also in the grotto. Scrope wishes to give it to the Headmaster.",
  "Scrope_10096": "It's adorned with the Black family crest. The Headmaster would be pleased with Scrope for returning it.",
  "Scrope_10097": "Apologies for the abundance of notes. Scrope wanted to be sure you weren't followed.",
  "Scrope_10098": "Scrope can tell you more in exchange for your help. But no one – especially the Headmaster – can know.",
  "Scrope_10099": "Scrope is grateful.",
  "Scrope_10100": "Oh, the Headmaster won't be upset. Scrope simply wants to surprise him. Scrope will explain.",
  "Scrope_10104": "Scrope is relieved. Scrope hoped the young Slytherin would be willing to help.",
  "Scrope_10105": "Scrope and the other house-elves are good at staying out of sight.",
  "Scrope_10106": "Scrope hears and sees many things in the castle.  Scrope knows how to keep secrets.",
  "Scrope_10111": "Scrope's master is indeed regal sir.",
  "Scrope_10112": "Scrope may only carry out the requests of Scrope's master, sir. As Scrope is sure sir knows.",
  "Scrope_10113": "Scrope is most sorry for sir. That no one would care about sir, and leave him so very neglected –",
  "Scrope_10114": "Poor Sir Nicholas. Nearly Headless, and also Nearly dusted, and never cared for or –",
  "Scrope_10115": "Scrope's relatives have been beheaded by the Black family sir.",
  "Scrope_10116": "(fretting)",
  "Scrope_10117": "Scrope can help you. And you can help Scrope.",
  "Scrope_10118": "Get to the courtyard past the pendulum. If you don't know it, you'll see it easy enough.",
  "Scrope_10119": "And don't tell anyone what you're up to –  especially Professor Black.",
  "Scrope_10120": "Apollonia forbade Scrope from entering the grotto long ago. Scrope continues to honour her wishes.",
  "Scrope_10121": "Good luck.",
  "Scrope_10122": "Scrope's late mistress Apollonia Black – may she rest in peace – was a student at Hogwarts over fifty years ago.",
  "Scrope_10123": "Before she died, she spoke with passion of pages ripped from a book. Scrope suspects she took them to her private grotto.",
  "Scrope_10124": "She was delirious at the end, poor thing. Mistook belladonna for elderberries. Scrope tried to warn her.",
  "Scrope_10125": "Scrope would not dare ask a student for help. But when Scrope learned you were looking for those pages, Scrope thought you might also find the ring.",
  "Scrope_10126": "Hmph. That boy was never good enough for Apollonia. What of the Black family ring?",
  "Scrope_10127": "Sad news indeed. Scrope shall need to think of another way to impress the Headmaster.",
  "Scrope_10128": "(sigh) Scrope takes some consolation in knowing that the young Slytherin found what they needed.",
  "Scrope_10129": "Scrope will wait right here for you. Best of luck finding your pages. And the ring.",
  "Scrope_10130": "Scrope would never presume to need anything from a student. Scrope simply thought that you might find the pages you seek in Apollonia's grotto –",
  "Scrope_10131": "– and that if you were to go there, you might also find the Black family ring.",
  "Scrope_10133": "And, of course, as Master knows, in French.",

  "SebastianSallow_10462": "See there? That’s the door that we need to reach.",
  "SebastianSallow_10463": "There's a spell you should know – the Disillusionment Charm. Good for getting places you're not supposed to be.",
  "SebastianSallow_10464": "Give it a try.",
  "SebastianSallow_10488": "I said 'usually', but it’ll still be all right. Do you see her desk behind me?",
  "SebastianSallow_10489": "The key is in the drawer of that desk. Now, here's what we're going to do.",
  "SebastianSallow_10490": "I’ll create a distraction to draw her away. You focus on getting the key. I’ll meet you outside the Restricted Section.",

  "SebastianSallow_10492": "<i>Alohomora</i>? That's how I always used to get in, but the librarian twigged that I knew the spell and cast an Anti-Alohomora charm on the lock.",

  "SebastianSallow_10537": "Where are you going? I thought you wanted to go to the Restricted Section?",
  "SebastianSallow_10539": "See you outside the Restricted Section.",
  "SebastianSallow_10656": "Something's happening.",
  "SebastianSallow_10674": "It's breathtaking.",
  "SebastianSallow_10680": "You know, the sooner we get to the village, the more time you can spend there.",
  "SebastianSallow_10681": "Shall we continue on? Hogsmeade awaits.",
  "SebastianSallow_10682": "I'm ready to get going whenever you are.",
  "SebastianSallow_10683": "I'm all for stopping to smell the roses, but could we hurry this along?",
  "SebastianSallow_10684": "We should keep moving.",
  "SebastianSallow_10685": "Are you ready to get going?",
  "SebastianSallow_10688": "Madam Scribner, the librarian, was on the hunt for me – as is often the case.",
  "SebastianSallow_10689": "Professor Weasley came to retrieve me and was able to convince ol' Scribner that I had somewhere to be.",
  "SebastianSallow_10690": "Lovely day for a stroll, I'll give you that.",
  "SebastianSallow_10691": "There's so much to be seen outside of the castle walls.",
  "SebastianSallow_10692": "Well, I suspect it's a matter of differing opinions.",
  "SebastianSallow_10693": "Oh, just one moment.",
  "SebastianSallow_10694": "This is an excellent spot to gather lacewing flies. They're pretty to look at, but if you stew them long enough they make a powerful potion ingredient.",
  "SebastianSallow_10696": "Looks like we aren't the only ones out enjoying the day.",
  "SebastianSallow_10697": "I actually grew up near here – not sure I appreciated it when I was younger.",
  "SebastianSallow_10703": "Merlin's beard! From the Forbidden Forest! Look!",
  "SebastianSallow_10705": "We're just off to Hogsmeade. Our new friend's never been.",
  "SebastianSallow_10706": "I wonder what Hippogriffs are doing this close to the school?",
  "SebastianSallow_10707": "Not too much further now.",
  "SebastianSallow_10708": "Did you know that when Muggles look at Hogwarts, all they see are ruins?",
  "SebastianSallow_10709": "Mr Moon is quite the character. My sister Anne thinks he's lovely, but I'd say he could improve a bit as caretaker.",
  "SebastianSallow_10711": "She is – or rather, she was. She's not well at the moment, but she'll be better soon and back at Hogwarts.",
  "SebastianSallow_10712": "Anyway, we're nearly there.",
  "SebastianSallow_10713": "I've always thought Thestrals pulling a carriage a bit grim.",
  "SebastianSallow_10714": "Unfortunately. But you've seen quite a bit yourself first-hand too –",
  "SebastianSallow_10715": "Though I suppose most people don't actually see them at all.",
  "SebastianSallow_10716": "Most notably that dragon attack.",
  "SebastianSallow_10717": "Hopefully the rest of your year isn't as eventful.",
  "SebastianSallow_10718": "Mr Moon! He's the Hogwarts caretaker. Looks a bit worse for wear.",
  "SebastianSallow_10720": "Is everything all right, sir?",
  "SebastianSallow_10721": "Have you had much of a chance to explore the castle?",
  "SebastianSallow_10722": "It is that. I've been there five years and barely scratched the surface. Loads to see. Places to discover.",
  "SebastianSallow_10723": "Perhaps one day. I can't go around telling you all my secrets now, can I?",
  "SebastianSallow_10724": "You still haven't told me how you became so good at duelling.",
  "SebastianSallow_10725": "Your arrival's stirred up the most excitement since the Grindylow incident in the Prefects' bathroom, and that was something.",
  "SebastianSallow_10727": "Do you know there are parts of the castle I still haven't seen? The place is absolutely massive.",
  "SebastianSallow_10728": "This is the best way to appreciate the lake, if you ask me. Warm and from a distance.",
  "SebastianSallow_10729": "I have no clue what to make of that run-in with Mr Moon.",
  "SebastianSallow_10733": "Speaking of Weasley, she seems to have taken quite a shine to you.",
  "SebastianSallow_10734": "I'm still surprised that a professor would entrust me with anything, given my detention record.",
  "SebastianSallow_10735": "Just enough to keep me well-rounded.",
  "SebastianSallow_10736": "I have to admit, it is quite picturesque out here – babbling brook and all.",
  "SebastianSallow_10737": "You know – it's tradition to tell all the first-years that there's a troll that lives under this bridge. ",
  "SebastianSallow_10749": "See for yourself! Quite a sight, isn't it?",
  "SebastianSallow_10750": "You certainly don't see that every day.",
  "SebastianSallow_10776": "We've got more to solve ahead.",
  "SebastianSallow_10783": "He's this way.",
  "SebastianSallow_10829": "I told him none of us will be able to avoid Dark Magic forever. So the more we know about Salazar Slytherin and the Dark Arts, the better prepared we'll be.",
  "SebastianSallow_10844": "This should be easy.",
  "SebastianSallow_10845": "<i>Protego</i>? That complicates things.",
  "SebastianSallow_10847": "Looks like a spellbook of some kind. This is incredible. A Hogwarts founder's possession – what an honour.",
  "SebastianSallow_10859": "That pain – I would've done anything to make it stop, but I'll survive. Let's keep moving.",
  "SebastianSallow_10868": "Good form.",
  "SebastianSallow_10880": "He's always angry. He's been angry since my parents died.",
  "SebastianSallow_10881": "Come with me. I need to show you where it happened.",
  "SebastianSallow_10883": "After Anne was hurt, he only grew worse. It's as though he blames me somehow. Always calling me 'my father's son.' As if that's an insult.",
  "SebastianSallow_10946": "Oh, no. This isn't good.",
  "SebastianSallow_10947": "Smoke. Over there, by the hamlet.",
  "SebastianSallow_10950": "Feldcroft's in trouble. They're under attack.",
  "SebastianSallow_10955": "We have to fight!",
  "SebastianSallow_10956": "You'll not win here.",
  "SebastianSallow_10958": "We've got them. They'll retreat. We'll make them retreat.",
  "SebastianSallow_10959": "I'm handling it.",
  "SebastianSallow_10960": "<i>Imperio</i>!",
  "SebastianSallow_10961": "Saved my sister! I –",
  "SebastianSallow_11002": "Did you speak with my uncle?",
  "SebastianSallow_11005": "What did my uncle expect me to do?",
  "SebastianSallow_11008": "The Imperius Curse saved Anne's life. That goblin was going to kill her.",
  "SebastianSallow_11011": "I acted in the moment. That's all.",
  "SebastianSallow_11029": "You'll never believe what I've learned.",
  "SebastianSallow_11031": "Evidently, he encouraged teaching Dark Magic at Hogwarts. Neither the Imperius Curse nor the Killing Curse was unforgivable during his time.",
  "SebastianSallow_11036": "Salazar Slytherin's spellbook was a little difficult to interpret, but fascinating.",
  "SebastianSallow_11037": "Precisely.",
  "SebastianSallow_11061": "Aha!",
  "SebastianSallow_11062": "Hey!",
  "SebastianSallow_11063": "But we haven't tried everything.",
  "SebastianSallow_11064": "Never. I can never accept it.",
  "SebastianSallow_11065": "Anne! I'm sorry!",
  "SebastianSallow_11066": "And don't feel sorry for Ominis. Keeping this to ourselves for now is for his own good.",
  "SebastianSallow_11067": "Turn me in?",
  "SebastianSallow_11068": "Isn't this incredible?",
  "SebastianSallow_11069": "I told you! The relic is the answer!",
  "SebastianSallow_11070": "I've been trying to reverse the Dark Magic that injured Anne, but this will allow me to control it –",
  "SebastianSallow_11078": "The Relic!",
  "SebastianSallow_11082": "That relic was going to save Anne!",
  "SebastianSallow_11083": "I must get out of here.",
  "SebastianSallow_11145": "– just as I can control the Inferi.",
  "SebastianSallow_11155": "Solomon! Don't!",
  "SebastianSallow_11156": "You'll pay for this!",
  "SebastianSallow_11236": "Argh! I won't let her suffer. <i>Avada Kedavra!</i>",
  "SebastianSallow_11237": "No!",
  "SebastianSallow_11238": "Oh, Anne!",
  "SebastianSallow_11239": "What have you done?",
  "SebastianSallow_11317": "I know.",
  "SebastianSallow_11318": "Lucky.",
  "SebastianSallow_11350": "What are you doing up there?",
  "SebastianSallow_11351": "How's the view?",
  "SebastianSallow_11359": "No matter what happens from here – I'm glad we met.",
  "SebastianSallow_11383": "Quickly now. Ranrok's Loyalists are everywhere.",
  "SebastianSallow_11422": "Nice teamwork.",
  "SebastianSallow_11479": "Professor – good to see you here.",
  "SebastianSallow_11481": "Should be in the clear now. No need for us to be skulking about.",
  "SebastianSallow_11503": "I'm looking for a cure to help my twin sister, Anne – so that she can return to Hogwarts.",
  "SebastianSallow_11504": "Something like that. It's not as foolproof as a cloak, but those are expensive. And spells – spells are free.",
  "SebastianSallow_11505": "Hold on now.",
  "SebastianSallow_11506": "Cast it, and you'll appear as little more than a trick of the light. Just as long as you keep your distance and stay quiet.",
  "SebastianSallow_11533": "I'm glad you came.",
  "SebastianSallow_11577": "Well? What did he say?",
  "SebastianSallow_11585": "Ha! That relic, Dark Magic or not, is the key to saving Anne. To reverse that curse. I will not lose Anne for good.",
  "SebastianSallow_11608": "So now it's just this key. But don't worry.",
  "SebastianSallow_11671": "Feel free to explore. We have time.",
  "SebastianSallow_11672": "Very well. I suppose we can take a break.",
  "SebastianSallow_11673": "I'll wait here for you.",
  "SebastianSallow_11749": "Practice? Felt more like I was duelling an expert.",
  "SebastianSallow_11750": "Ha! Fair enough. You owe me an honest duel when you aren't.",
  "SebastianSallow_11754": "Till next time.",
  "SebastianSallow_11779": "I wouldn't dream of it.",
  "SebastianSallow_11784": "But I can do that later. For now, I say we explore this room.",
  "SebastianSallow_11850": "You're here. Brilliant.",
  "SebastianSallow_11895": "Hmph – not even a scratch.",
  "SebastianSallow_11896": "They were no match.",
  "SebastianSallow_11897": "They're defeated – as expected.",
  "SebastianSallow_11901": "Quietly now.",
  "SebastianSallow_11902": "– silent as a grave.",
  "SebastianSallow_11903": "We must remain unseen.",
  "SebastianSallow_11920": "Watch yourself – you look a bit weak.",
  "SebastianSallow_11921": "Oh dear – you don't look too well.",
  "SebastianSallow_11922": "Damn it. Stay with me – don't give up.",
  "SebastianSallow_11923": "Hold on – I shan't let death come for you.",
  "SebastianSallow_11937": "No use hesitating.",
  "SebastianSallow_11938": "There's a special joy in going where you shouldn't.",
  "SebastianSallow_11939": "We do so adore restricted areas, don't we?",
  "SebastianSallow_11942": "You're more powerful than you let on.",
  "SebastianSallow_11943": "My, my – such magic.",
  "SebastianSallow_11944": "Exceptional. You'll have to teach me that.",
  "SebastianSallow_11954": "Ha. I see you've put the curses I taught you to good use.",
  "SebastianSallow_11963": "(sigh) If you must.",
  "SebastianSallow_11964": "Don't get caught now.",
  "SebastianSallow_11968": "Not scared to muddy your hands, are you.",
  "SebastianSallow_11969": "Oh dear, try not to make a mess, will you.",
  "SebastianSallow_11978": "Congratulations – nothing quite like your own broom.",
  "SebastianSallow_11979": "Enhanced your broom, have you? Impressive.",
  "SebastianSallow_11980": "Oh – a lock. You'll make short work of this.",
  "SebastianSallow_11981": "An Unlocking Charm should do the trick.",
  "SebastianSallow_11982": "Bother. It's one of those locks.",
  "SebastianSallow_12034": "Damn. We've been seen.",
  "SebastianSallow_12035": "No point in hiding now.",
  "SebastianSallow_12036": "They've spotted us.",
  "SebastianSallow_12037": "Blast. They saw us.",
  "SebastianSallow_12038": "They know we're here.",
  "SebastianSallow_12039": "Ha. They're on to us – not a stupid as I thought.",
  "SebastianSallow_12053": "All better then?",
  "SebastianSallow_12054": "You can thank me later.",
  "SebastianSallow_12055": "At least there's no Peeves in the library to ruin things this time.",
  "SebastianSallow_12056": "Tread lightly. We are unwelcome guests here.",
  "SebastianSallow_12057": "Ah, going where we shouldn't – again.",
  "SebastianSallow_12096": "See them? I doubt they're friendly.",
  "SebastianSallow_12097": "If we have to fight them, I shall stand with you.",
  "SebastianSallow_12098": "Blast. Why am I not surprised they're here?",
  "SebastianSallow_12106": "You're a natural.",
  "SebastianSallow_12107": "Flying like that is dangerous – and delightful.",
  "SebastianSallow_12109": "A Graphorn? Well no one can accuse you of not travelling in style.",
  "SebastianSallow_12110": "How in Merlin's beard did they find a Graphorn?",
  "SebastianSallow_12111": "It's not easy to gain a Hippogriff's trust.",
  "SebastianSallow_12112": "Riding a Hippogriff must feel majestic.",
  "SebastianSallow_12113": "Is it true you saved a child? Well done.",
  "SebastianSallow_12114": "I hear Rookwood lost his Hippogriff – because of you.",
  "SebastianSallow_12115": "I hear Gringotts got back their cursebreaker. How fortunate.",
  "SebastianSallow_12116": "You captured Victor Rookwood? I bet that was a duel worth seeing.",
  "SebastianSallow_12134": "Are you in pyjamas?",
  "SebastianSallow_12135": "Word has it you outflew Imelda Reyes. Bet she loved that.",
  "SebastianSallow_12156": "Fig has taken a liking to you. I've tried asking about his subject before but he was always too busy.",
  "SebastianSallow_12157": "(sigh) I'm sorry about Fig. He was fortunate to have you.",
  "SebastianSallow_12158": "I grew up with goblin raids on our hamlet but I never imagined they'd attack the school.",
  "SebastianSallow_12160": "Goblins – how pathetic – thought they could take the school.",
  "SebastianSallow_12179": "Now, you'll share? You wouldn't tell me when I practically begged.",
  "SebastianSallow_12185": "I'm ready.",
  "SebastianSallow_12186": "Aaaarrrghhhh!",
  "SebastianSallow_12187": "Ready?",
  "SebastianSallow_12188": "<i>Crucio!</i>",
  "SebastianSallow_12189": "Well – three heads are better than one.",
  "SebastianSallow_12193": "Dark, ominous corridors. My favourite.",
  "SebastianSallow_12194": "Come on, that was a good one.",
  "SebastianSallow_12227": "Wish we had some Liquid Luck.",
  "SebastianSallow_12228": "We made it. We found Salazar Slytherin's scriptorium.",
  "SebastianSallow_12233": "Ha. They were no match for you.",
  "SebastianSallow_12234": "(laughs) They had little chance against a foe of your calibre.",
  "SebastianSallow_12235": "Nothing but a weakling!",
  "SebastianSallow_12236": "Keep an eye – I doubt what's ahead is friendly.",
  "SebastianSallow_12237": "Keep still. I can help you.",
  "SebastianSallow_12299": "Oh? Which one?",
  "SebastianSallow_12304": "Very well.",
  "SebastianSallow_12305": "Of course. You're the only one with whom I would entrust such knowledge.",
  "SebastianSallow_12306": "Let's speak again soon.",
  "SebastianSallow_12358": "(cheers)",
  "SebastianSallow_12475": "There they are. Let's go.",
  "SebastianSallow_12552": "I bet the Thestral nest's close by.",
  "SebastianSallow_12611": "I was thinking about dead goblins.",
  "SebastianSallow_12652": "Rumours about the manor have run rampant for ages. I can see why. It's in a terrible state!",
  "SebastianSallow_12653": "Careful – we don't want to end up like our poor friend back there. Wands at the ready.",
  "SebastianSallow_12677": "You're here. Good.",
  "SebastianSallow_12678": "I'll be interested to compare what lies inside to what I've read about this catacomb.",
  "SebastianSallow_12679": "Now this is the sort of great room I want to be buried in.",
  "SebastianSallow_12686": "<i>Imperio</i>? No, that's insanity.",
  "SebastianSallow_12687": "Ominis! The sounds we kept hearing. It was you.",
  "SebastianSallow_12692": "Could it be?",
  "SebastianSallow_12695": "Have a look. Unfortunately, there's no name on it. But, I suspect if it was important enough for Slytherin to stash in his spellbook –",
  "SebastianSallow_12700": "I believe one of Slytherin's students stumbled upon the relic during an assignment to study sarcophagi in this catacomb.",
  "SebastianSallow_12709": "Perhaps that was it, and the rest of the tomb will be insect free.",
  "SebastianSallow_12713": "Grandeur and then some. Even an altar with a pile of bones – lovely.",
  "SebastianSallow_12714": "All this grass – it no longer feels like a tomb.",
  "SebastianSallow_12722": "I knew we'd get through. I felt it in my bones.",
  "SebastianSallow_12725": "I can't believe it. After all this, it lines up. We've really found it!",
  "SebastianSallow_12739": "I must keep this relic secret. Especially from my uncle.",
  "SebastianSallow_12742": "So, you wouldn't learn <i>Imperio</i> earlier, but now you'll learn it to use on my best friend?",
  "SebastianSallow_12747": "I've heard that <i>Imperio</i> leaves you feeling a bit dazed, but other than that I can't be sure.",
  "SebastianSallow_12748": "I simply cannot let you – ",
  "SebastianSallow_12753": "Please, be careful.",
  "SebastianSallow_12845": "Looks like Ranrok's Loyalists were heading further up the path.",
  "SebastianSallow_12917": "What is it?",
  "SebastianSallow_12918": "Anne won't survive this. She's withering away – inside and out. Solomon's never been there for us. Not really.",
  "SebastianSallow_12919": "I can't stay here. I need to find Ominis.",
  "SebastianSallow_12930": "Can I help you?",
  "SebastianSallow_12932": "I'm told you're in dire need of supplies and I'm to accompany you into Hogsmeade for them.",
  "SebastianSallow_12935": "Is this your first foray into the village?",
  "SebastianSallow_12936": "Well, I shall endeavour to be the very best of guides then.",
  "SebastianSallow_12937": "Ah! My new 'charge'.",
  "SebastianSallow_12938": "Hogsmeade's a charming little place. Self-contained, too. We should be able to find you everything that you need. Shall we?",
  "SebastianSallow_12939": "I was glad Professor Weasley asked me to join you today.",
  "SebastianSallow_12940": "Of course! You're the only one who's ever bested me in a duel. The way I see it, I'd be wise to keep an eye on you.",
  "SebastianSallow_12941": "Over here.",
  "SebastianSallow_12944": "This way.",
  "SebastianSallow_12945": "There's a secret passage just here.",
  "SebastianSallow_12948": "I should tell you: I swore to Ominis I would safeguard this place, so, please keep this between us.",
  "SebastianSallow_12951": "That's it.",
  "SebastianSallow_12954": "You'll get used to it.",
  "SebastianSallow_12955": "Well done.",
  "SebastianSallow_12963": "When I head to Feldcroft, I'll send you an owl.",
  "SebastianSallow_12981": "Be coy if you like, but I know better. Magic requires intention and talent.",
  "SebastianSallow_12982": "That duel was quite something. Everyone'll be talking about it.",
  "SebastianSallow_12997": "You know, you might be a perfect fit for a certain exclusive, unsanctioned duelling organisation.",
  "SebastianSallow_12998": "Excellent. Knew I was right about you.",
  "SebastianSallow_12999": "Yes. To keep students in the dark. So many things we're deemed unprepared to know.",
  "SebastianSallow_13011": "– you just have to be clever enough not to get caught.",
  "SebastianSallow_13024": "She thinks I shouldn't be allowed in the Restricted Section, and I, on the other hand, am inclined to disagree.",
  "SebastianSallow_13025": "Speaking of detention, this trip to Hogsmeade might've saved me from one.",
  "SebastianSallow_13035": "Ah, the wanderer returns. Now, where were we? Ah –",
  "SebastianSallow_13036": "Off we go again. What was I saying? Oh, yes –",
  "SebastianSallow_13037": "So as I was just saying –",
  "SebastianSallow_13038": "That is not helpful –",
  "SebastianSallow_13039": "Well, I suppose – no.",
  "SebastianSallow_13040": "Hm.",
  "SebastianSallow_13041": "Already knew that –",
  "SebastianSallow_13042": "– ah. You're the new fifth-year.  I'm Sebastian Sallow. Welcome to Slytherin.",
  "SebastianSallow_13056": "There he is. Good luck.",
  "SebastianSallow_13058": "The rubble formed a relief of a person facing a snake.",
  "SebastianSallow_13060": "Seems you knew your Aunt Noctua well. Odd that you've never spoken of her.",
  "SebastianSallow_13062": "I pressed Ominis regarding Salazar Slytherin's scriptorium, but my efforts were in vain. Meet me outside the Slytherin common room. We need to talk.",
  "SebastianSallow_13063": "Not everyone has a Ministry escort to school.",
  "SebastianSallow_13067": "Still – impressive.",
  "SebastianSallow_13069": "Nice meeting you, too. Good luck today.",
  "SebastianSallow_13070": "A spell book I picked up. Has a few interesting things, but not exactly what I was looking for.",
  "SebastianSallow_13071": "I'm sure you'll find out soon enough, but not every spell you may need can be found in our assigned textbooks.",
  "SebastianSallow_13074": "You? I suppose it's worth a try, but don't get your hopes up. Ominis is annoyingly stubborn. Nothing new.",
  "SebastianSallow_13085": "Must run in the family.",
  "SebastianSallow_13088": "Another? Not the welcoming sort, was he?",
  "SebastianSallow_13091": "It's as if we're meant to be here.",
  "SebastianSallow_13092": "Another gate. We'll solve it in no time.",
  "SebastianSallow_13093": "All the gates have symbols, and there are symbols on the dial.",
  "SebastianSallow_13100": "All I heard was rewards. Keep going.",
  "SebastianSallow_13103": "May I have a look?",
  "SebastianSallow_13104": "I see a way out.",
  "SebastianSallow_13109": "Salazar Slytherin didn't make this easy.",
  "SebastianSallow_13110": "This is looking rather dire, isn't it?",
  "SebastianSallow_13111": "Every dial seems to be getting more difficult, but we've made it this far. Don't give up.",
  "SebastianSallow_13114": "It's going to be difficult.",
  "SebastianSallow_13121": "Keep an eye out. Never know who's watching – although that hasn't stopped us before.",
  "SebastianSallow_13122": "Damned poltergeist – such a nuisance.",
  "SebastianSallow_13124": "So how would you like to do this? Weasley told me you had a list of things to get – a wand and some other bits?",
  "SebastianSallow_13125": "Between the two of you, I'm starting to feel left out.",
  "SebastianSallow_13129": "It's up to us. I can teach you <i>Crucio</i> or I can cast it on you.",
  "SebastianSallow_13138": "Excellent.",
  "SebastianSallow_13144": "And a short list gives you plenty of time to poke around the village.",
  "SebastianSallow_13145": "Remember, have fun. It's Hogsmeade.",
  "SebastianSallow_13146": "Since our visit to Feldcroft, something's dawned on me about the triptych. Meet me at the Overlook, just north of the Forbidden Forest and I’ll explain.",
  "SebastianSallow_13155": "I've no idea. But perhaps they're searching it – the way they did Rookwood Castle and Isidora's manor. How do we want to handle this?",
  "SebastianSallow_13159": "Very well.",
  "SebastianSallow_13160": "I thought my owl might pique your interest.",
  "SebastianSallow_13161": "After you.",
  "SebastianSallow_13162": "We should move on.",
  "SebastianSallow_13164": "I have something to tell you. You'll want to see where this might lead.",
  "SebastianSallow_13165": "I'll let you lead.",
  "SebastianSallow_13169": "This is going well.",
  "SebastianSallow_13170": "We do at that.",
  "SebastianSallow_13174": "I should tell you – rumour is, this mine was closed long ago due to an infestation of spiders.",
  "SebastianSallow_13175": "That's the spirit.",
  "SebastianSallow_13177": "And the fun is over.",
  "SebastianSallow_13178": "Ha! It is. And that was – relatively fun.",
  "SebastianSallow_13197": "You know which one I'd choose.",
  "SebastianSallow_13198": "Sneaking around has its appeal.",
  "SebastianSallow_13199": "We're making quick progress.",
  "SebastianSallow_13205": "It was closed after accidents were reported. Now, I see why.",
  "SebastianSallow_13208": "Too disgusting for even a spider to prey on.",
  "SebastianSallow_13213": "That ledge is awfully high. Any ideas?",
  "SebastianSallow_13215": "How many of Ranrok's Loyalists are in here?",
  "SebastianSallow_13216": "Could be the hairy legs. Or the soulless eyes. Or the venomous fangs. Any number of endearing qualities, really.",
  "SebastianSallow_13220": "We're making quick work of them.",
  "SebastianSallow_13221": "She would at that. Ranrok's Loyalists have all but declared war.",
  "SebastianSallow_13234": "Brilliant. Our efforts weren't in vain after all.",
  "SebastianSallow_13235": "Now, for the trek back out of here and to Hogwarts.",
  "SebastianSallow_13239": "And now for the moment of truth.",
  "SebastianSallow_13251": "We're in for more trouble.",
  "SebastianSallow_13252": "Honestly, if one could bottle the magic of this place –",
  "SebastianSallow_13253": "I don't know if it's the shops or the people, but there's just something about Hogsmeade.",
  "SebastianSallow_13254": "We all flock to it like moths to a flame.",
  "SebastianSallow_13263": "Should've thought to conjure stairs.",
  "SebastianSallow_13274": "That bridge has seen better days.",
  "SebastianSallow_13277": "Perfect. Can't wait to see what you do with a new wand.",
  "SebastianSallow_13282": "I just have to pop into a shop to find something for my sister. Let's meet up in the town circle when you're finished.",
  "SebastianSallow_13285": "It's almost as if they were waiting.",
  "SebastianSallow_13313": "My friend, Ominis Gaunt. He named it the Undercroft.",
  "SebastianSallow_13315": "We used to sneak in here almost daily. We've never been caught.",
  "SebastianSallow_13318": "Anyway, the Undercroft has been a perfect place to sneak off to – away from prying eyes – and even practise otherwise forbidden spells.",
  "SebastianSallow_13326": "Like the Blasting Curse.",
  "SebastianSallow_13327": "Professors say it's not an appropriate spell to teach students.",
  "SebastianSallow_13330": "To be fair, I'm admittedly partial to more fiery forms of magic –",
  "SebastianSallow_13331": "My thoughts exactly.",
  "SebastianSallow_13332": "– but you should learn it. I can teach it to you safely here.",
  "SebastianSallow_13336": "It may take a while to get the feel for it.",
  "SebastianSallow_13337": "Mimic my wand movement. The incantation is <i>Confringo</i>.",
  "SebastianSallow_13338": "Nice work! How's it feel?",
  "SebastianSallow_13350": "Of course – Scribner tried to give me detention, but I have ways out of these things.",
  "SebastianSallow_13355": "I take it you found everything on your list?",
  "SebastianSallow_13357": "We've still not seen a single rune symbol.",
  "SebastianSallow_13358": "An unwelcome distraction at that.",
  "SebastianSallow_13361": "Anything to do with Salazar Slytherin is worth the risk.",
  "SebastianSallow_13362": "I won't give up.",
  "SebastianSallow_13363": "He's being ridiculous. Apparently, Salazar Slytherin had a secret scriptorium here in Hogwarts.",
  "SebastianSallow_13369": "Ominis swears it was used for the Dark Arts, so he wants nothing to do with it.",
  "SebastianSallow_13395": "I'll make Ominis understand. He'll change his mind.",
  "SebastianSallow_13404": "Perhaps when I next head to Feldcroft, you could come along. Meet Anne. She could use some cheering up.",
  "SebastianSallow_13427": "Thought we were better than that.",
  "SebastianSallow_13428": "You and I are unstoppable.",
  "SebastianSallow_13429": "Next time you need a partner for Crossed Wands, don't hesitate to call on me.",
  "SebastianSallow_13438": "Very well. Wish me luck.",
  "SebastianSallow_13440": "Ominis, I'm truly sorry about your aunt. But, I know what to do.",
  "SebastianSallow_13441": "Remember, three braziers are involved.",
  "SebastianSallow_13442": "Tortured faces on the door and <i>Crucio</i> is etched into the stone. My guess is if we cast the Cruciatus Curse, the door will open.",
  "SebastianSallow_13492": "Very well. Be very precise with your wand movement. The incantation is, '<i>Imperio</i>.'",
  "SebastianSallow_13493": "Are there any other curses you'd like to learn?",
  "SebastianSallow_13495": "After all that's happened? Very well. You need to be precise with your wand movement. The incantation is, '<i>Avada Kedavra</i>.'",
  "SebastianSallow_13496": "Very well. Now remember: your intention matters. And be precise with your wand movement. The incantation is, '<i>Crucio</i>.'",
  "SebastianSallow_13497": "You made it.",
  "SebastianSallow_13498": "Keeping an eye on things. Feldcroft isn't what it used to be.",
  "SebastianSallow_13501": "Ranrok's Loyalists are capable of so much more than people realise.",
  "SebastianSallow_13502": "Seems I may have met a kindred spirit. (laughs) That is a conversation for another time.",
  "SebastianSallow_13503": "It was good meeting you. Good luck today.",
  "SebastianSallow_13507": "It worked.",
  "SebastianSallow_13518": "What did Mr Moon?",
  "SebastianSallow_13532": "Why would the door lead us here?",
  "SebastianSallow_13564": "I'd say we've earned a Butterbeer or two, wouldn't you? Might help me forget that I was almost pulverised by a troll.",
  "SebastianSallow_13565": "Ready to learn a thing or two?",
  "SebastianSallow_13566": "<i>Stupefy!</i>",
  "SebastianSallow_13567": "(efforts)",
  "SebastianSallow_13568": "(chuckling)",
  "SebastianSallow_13579": "Are you all right?",
  "SebastianSallow_13581": "Assuming it isn't utter bedlam in there, you might even meet Sirona, the owner. She's a good one to know.",
  "SebastianSallow_13589": "They've left all of this simply strewn about. Tells me they're after something bigger.",
  "SebastianSallow_13590": "All the debris you'll see is from whatever's going on at that abandoned estate.",
  "SebastianSallow_13591": "They've been digging for something.",
  "SebastianSallow_13592": "Up there – on that plateau – is where they cursed Anne. This way.",
  "SebastianSallow_13593": "Precisely. That's why I’m on the hunt for answers. If I'm to cure her, I need to understand what happened to her.",
  "SebastianSallow_13596": "Might be the only way to learn what type of magic harmed her. Which could help me find a cure.",
  "SebastianSallow_13600": "Look at this.",
  "SebastianSallow_13606": "What, a daydream? Because that happens to me, too.",
  "SebastianSallow_13619": "Why am I not surprised?",
  "SebastianSallow_13631": "No. Someone in his family knew about it. The Gaunts are full of secrets.",
  "SebastianSallow_13674": "And on that note, I think we should head back to the castle.",
  "SebastianSallow_13675": "Perfect. The Three Broomsticks is just this way.",
  "SebastianSallow_13677": "I'm certainly glad Sirona was there. Told you she was one of the good ones.",
  "SebastianSallow_13681": "We need to move. Now.",
  "SebastianSallow_13682": "What? Talking to Victor Rookwood?",
  "SebastianSallow_13683": "That's one way to put it. Quickly. Inside.",
  "SebastianSallow_13684": "You got a first-hand glance at what I'm dealing with. I apologise for my uncle.",
  "SebastianSallow_13686": "It may be grasping at Billywigs, but I keep thinking that there might be something here that could lead me to whoever cursed Anne.",
  "SebastianSallow_13687": "Why bother blocking a stairwell?",
  "SebastianSallow_13689": "I've been thinking – a 'Keeper' lived in that house centuries ago, and Ranrok and his lot have been searching there.",
  "SebastianSallow_13691": "Blasted Peeves. I've got to stop him, or at least get to the librarian with a good excuse for all of this.",
  "SebastianSallow_13692": "Stick to the targets though – best to keep the Undercroft intact.",
  "SebastianSallow_13693": "You're getting it! Ready to actually try it out?",
  "SebastianSallow_13706": "I shouldn't have reacted so bitterly about your goblin friend. I apologise. I hope we can finish what we started with the triptych.  Please meet me at the southern coast – we can search for the final canvas piece.",
  "SebastianSallow_13708": "Nothing pleasant about this coast.",
  "SebastianSallow_13710": "Practice? It felt more like I was duelling an expert. Sebastian Sallow, by the way.",
  "SebastianSallow_13711": "Didn't expect a new student to be so deft with a wand.",
  "SebastianSallow_13712": "Then again, perhaps this wasn't your first duel.",
  "SebastianSallow_13715": "You said something was missing from what you found in the library.",
  "SebastianSallow_13716": "Might it have something to do with Victor Rookwood? He didn't 'mistake' you for someone else at all in Hogsmeade, did he?",
  "SebastianSallow_13729": "And I am. Meet me outside the Library tonight. And tell no one.",
  "SebastianSallow_13732": "Detention, no doubt. But a word of caution or two will help – for one, avoid Peeves the poltergeist.",
  "SebastianSallow_13733": "Aside from wanton destruction of property, he loves nothing more than telling on the likes of us.",
  "SebastianSallow_13737": "Madam Scribner doesn't take kindly to clandestine activities taking place amongst her precious books, so do all that you can to avoid her.",
  "SebastianSallow_13738": "She and I have had our entanglements, but I can hold my own against her. You may not be so lucky.",
  "SebastianSallow_13740": "I was hoping to see you. I was in the Three Broomsticks after the troll attack, and saw what happened with Rookwood and Harlow.",
  "SebastianSallow_13742": "Understood. Your secret's safe with me. Whatever it is.",
  "SebastianSallow_13743": "So, why were you looking for me?",
  "SebastianSallow_13745": "I refuse to believe that. Anne's pain is more than physical. It has changed her entirely.",
  "SebastianSallow_13759": "Something's going on over there.",
  "SebastianSallow_13761": "The first time Ominis and I practised <i>Confringo</i>, we singed our eyebrows.",
  "SebastianSallow_13762": "I swore we'd never live it down. To this day, there's something about that spell that's addictive.",
  "SebastianSallow_13764": "(laughs) You'll get used to it. Anne, Ominis and I used to practise down here for hours. The Undercroft was our retreat.",
  "SebastianSallow_13766": "Haven't been here in some time. It's not the same without Anne.",
  "SebastianSallow_13768": "Cheers. By the way, what was it you couldn't discuss out in the hall earlier?",
  "SebastianSallow_13772": "I think you'll need to tell me why Victor Rookwood has you in his sights. But we can talk later. For the moment, we should return to the castle.",
  "SebastianSallow_13775": "We used to play Gobstones here all the time – with my sister, Anne.",
  "SebastianSallow_13777": "Unbelievable.",
  "SebastianSallow_13780": "Ancient magic? I don't know what I was expecting you to say, but it wasn't that. What does that even mean?",
  "SebastianSallow_13784": "Could be. But it looks to me as though this was intentional.",
  "SebastianSallow_13786": "I wouldn't be surprised to find a couple more rune symbols.",
  "SebastianSallow_13787": "Wasn't expecting that.",
  "SebastianSallow_13788": "I wasn't looking forward to the trek back out of here and to Hogwarts. Those ancient magic passageways of yours do come in handy.",
  "SebastianSallow_13790": "What do you have there?",
  "SebastianSallow_13791": "Hopefully it will help us unravel more of this mystery.",
  "SebastianSallow_13793": "And by that logic, three is better than two. Simple mathematics, Ominis.",
  "SebastianSallow_13794": "Gaunt? Ominis – your family was here.",
  "SebastianSallow_13800": "Are you telling me that goblins may be wielding some sort of wizard magic?",
  "SebastianSallow_13803": "Watch for my owl. I'll have news soon enough.",
  "SebastianSallow_13807": "Outside the library, after dark.",
  "SebastianSallow_13808": "And those annoying prefects would love nothing more than to rat on us to Scribner, so don't let them see us – understood?",
  "SebastianSallow_13809": "A Demiguise? I don't know what he's putting in his pumpkin juice, but he's obviously had too much of it.",
  "SebastianSallow_13815": "The gate! I think we're locked in. Again.",
  "SebastianSallow_13817": "Not many students have Victor Rookwood's attention. What was that all about?",
  "SebastianSallow_13818": "Ranrok? And when were you at Gringotts?",
  "SebastianSallow_13819": "If you say so. I won't press you now, but you will have to tell me what's going on at some point. You might need me.",
  "SebastianSallow_13828": "A Portkey? To Gringotts? I'm not sure I follow.",
  "SebastianSallow_13829": "You can't be serious.",
  "SebastianSallow_13830": "He can't get it himself?",
  "SebastianSallow_13831": "You want to show some initiative.",
  "SebastianSallow_13832": "There you are. You promised me an explanation for what happened in the Three Broomsticks.",
  "SebastianSallow_13833": "I'm sorry you had to see that.",
  "SebastianSallow_13834": "And this 'ability' of yours – does it allow you to wield this magic too?",
  "SebastianSallow_13842": "You know goblins cursed my sister to shut her up. Said she should be 'seen and not heard.'",
  "SebastianSallow_13845": "Why would I listen to someone so ignorant?",
  "SebastianSallow_13850": "Ranrok's Loyalists are out for blood.",
  "SebastianSallow_13855": "A goblin? Tell me I'm wrong.",
  "SebastianSallow_13858": "That's why Noctua died. She had no one to cast the curse on. Ominis has the most experience with this. He should cast it.",
  "SebastianSallow_13859": "Good. Work your 'magic' so to speak.",
  "SebastianSallow_13860": "I do that – occasionally.",
  "SebastianSallow_13863": "Ridiculous. As if dying in here is a better option than casting a damned spell.",
  "SebastianSallow_13866": "Because I'm not sure I do. Ominis knows that, yet he's left us no choice – I don't yearn to follow in Noctua Gaunt's footsteps.",
  "SebastianSallow_13869": "I think I can cast it if I have to.",
  "SebastianSallow_13870": "Very well. If that's what you want. To perform the spell, raise your wand, point it at me and firmly declare, <i>Crucio</i>. Hold on as long as you can.",
  "SebastianSallow_13871": "I shan't forget this.",
  "SebastianSallow_13872": "He believed students should be prepared to use Dark Magic when necessary – not to fear it.",
  "SebastianSallow_13877": "And I'm glad we did it. Because in the spellbook I also found something else.",
  "SebastianSallow_13881": "I plan to search for this relic, but I don't think we should tell anyone. Especially Ominis. He wouldn't understand.",
  "SebastianSallow_13882": "I'm glad you agree.",
  "SebastianSallow_13884": "Ominis – We were just about to get some air. Care to join?",
  "SebastianSallow_13885": "No I didn't. I said I understood you wanting that. I'd never swear to give up on finding a cure for Anne.",
  "SebastianSallow_13888": "I know when not to stop. Leave this alone, Ominis.",
  "SebastianSallow_13893": "What I do with every book: read it. Having professors as parents ingrained that habit early on.",
  "SebastianSallow_13894": "I don't want to leave, but I owe you – both of you.",
  "SebastianSallow_13899": "Understood. I'm truly sorry about your aunt, Ominis.",
  "SebastianSallow_13900": "Professor Weasley's certain to hear about the troll attack soon if she hasn't already.",
  "SebastianSallow_13901": "I did. So, I suppose the world is our oyster now. Let's see what else we can get up to.",
  "SebastianSallow_13903": "Hello Mr Moon. Have you met our new fifth-year?",
  "SebastianSallow_13905": "Thanks to this one.",
  "SebastianSallow_13906": "Single-handedly took down a troll.",
  "SebastianSallow_13907": "Trolls, Ranrok, and Rookwood? What are you not telling me?",
  "SebastianSallow_13909": "No one has felt safe here since Ranrok's Loyalists took a peculiar interest in that castle over there – Rookwood Castle.",
  "SebastianSallow_13911": "My uncle Solomon is a former Auror and refuses to look into it, even after Anne was cursed by one of them.",
  "SebastianSallow_13916": "By the way, hope you're faring well with the Blasting Curse. It's still one of my favourites.",
  "SebastianSallow_13918": "Hold on. Goblins. We may want to double back.",
  "SebastianSallow_13919": "Possibly with a wand, no less.",
  "SebastianSallow_13921": "And at Rookwood Castle.",
  "SebastianSallow_13923": "Only one way to find out.",
  "SebastianSallow_13924": "Been abandoned long as I've lived here. Rumour was, a Hogwarts professor lived here once – centuries ago – but that's all I ever heard.",
  "SebastianSallow_13925": "I've heard that goblin dig sites like these are popping up everywhere.",
  "SebastianSallow_13926": "Then we'll have to unravel what this all means. But now, I need to see Ominis. Don't worry, I won't tell him anything.",
  "SebastianSallow_13932": "If I were you, I'd be begging for more details.",
  "SebastianSallow_13933": "Very well. But do keep this between us.",
  "SebastianSallow_13937": "Ominis learned Dark Magic from his parents. Are you familiar with the Cruciatus Curse?",
  "SebastianSallow_13941": "Perhaps I've spoken out of turn. Ominis's family history is personal to him.",
  "SebastianSallow_13948": "I'll remind him of that when I follow up about the scriptorium.",
  "SebastianSallow_13949": "Let's go, quickly. Before we're spotted.",
  "SebastianSallow_13953": "I spotted droves of Ranrok's Loyalists coming up from the coast. Overheard one of them say they're headed to another cavern, like the one we found.",
  "SebastianSallow_13966": "Keep a close eye out. I saw some of Ranrok's crew moving off the path just ahead.",
  "SebastianSallow_13967": "Raiding, I imagine. This mountain used to safeguard local hamlet valuables.",
  "SebastianSallow_13968": "Thestrals overhead. Some consider them a bad omen.",
  "SebastianSallow_13970": "I'm making small talk. I'm not going to trek up this mountain in silence.",
  "SebastianSallow_13974": "I know that.",
  "SebastianSallow_13982": "There's more to Dark Magic than people realise. The Gaunts know this – better than most.",
  "SebastianSallow_13987": "It's certainly not something I'd hoped we'd have in common.",
  "SebastianSallow_13988": "But I didn't.",
  "SebastianSallow_13992": "Ridiculous notions of ownership.",
  "SebastianSallow_13993": "They got what they deserved.",
  "SebastianSallow_13994": "This must be it.",
  "SebastianSallow_13996": "Oh, your goblin friend?",
  "SebastianSallow_13997": "Spiders – how fitting.",
  "SebastianSallow_13998": "I'm sure we'd taste better than a goblin-dinner.",
  "SebastianSallow_14005": "Look at this place! Not really my style. A bit much, if you ask me.",
  "SebastianSallow_14024": "You sound like Ominis. He frowns upon using forbidden spells. Although he did enjoy learning this one.",
  "SebastianSallow_14025": "A spell like <i>Confringo</i> is only truly dangerous in untrained hands. Such spells should be properly taught, not banned.",
  "SebastianSallow_14026": "I'm listening.",
  "SebastianSallow_14027": "I trusted you with knowledge of this secret Undercroft. You can trust me.",
  "SebastianSallow_14029": "Pity. Didn't think you'd disappoint me with so vague an answer.",
  "SebastianSallow_14030": "Gringotts? When were you there?",
  "SebastianSallow_14031": "A Portkey. To Gringotts?",
  "SebastianSallow_14032": "In the meantime, with both Rookwood and Ranrok after you, I suspect a bit more time practising the Blasting Curse is in order.",
  "SebastianSallow_14033": "Meeting a new student will be precisely what she needs. Trust me.",
  "SebastianSallow_14041": "Solomon can't take Anne from Feldcroft. Where would they go? When would I see her?",
  "SebastianSallow_14042": "See you soon.",
  "SebastianSallow_14045": "I've learned more about the relic. I cross-referenced Slytherin's spellbook with everything in the library on relics and Dark sacrifices.",
  "SebastianSallow_14046": "That's when I realised something: I believe the relic will only work inside the catacomb.",
  "SebastianSallow_14047": "He helped find the scriptorium where we discovered Slytherin's spellbook.",
  "SebastianSallow_14057": "I've never heard anyone else speak of it – and I've certainly never seen anyone else here.",
  "SebastianSallow_14058": "Again, mention this to no one, especially Ominis. He has no love lost for his family or their secrets, but this place is special to him.",
  "SebastianSallow_14063": "But this is different. Whoever you cast it upon will have agreed to it first. It wouldn't be an innocent 'victim.' We have to open the door.",
  "SebastianSallow_14072": "Ominis, I know this is the last thing you want to do –",
  "SebastianSallow_14079": "Seems as if something's missing.",
  "SebastianSallow_14080": "Anything helpful in the note?",
  "SebastianSallow_14081": "Oh, I know precisely what I'm saying.",
  "SebastianSallow_14089": "It's known as the Torture Curse – <i>Crucio</i>. It inflicts intense, excruciating pain on the victim.",
  "SebastianSallow_14090": "Apparently, his parents and his older siblings had no qualms about casting it on Muggles for sport.",
  "SebastianSallow_14092": "Ominis described the sound of the victims' cries as horrific. So, the first time he was asked to cast it himself as a child, he couldn't bring himself to do it.",
  "SebastianSallow_14093": "As punishment, his family cast it on him. The anguish was so bad, that when asked to cast it again, he relented.",
  "SebastianSallow_14094": "I have repeatedly assured Ominis he did what he had to, but he still hasn't forgiven himself.",
  "SebastianSallow_14096": "After that incident, the rift between Ominis and his family only grew. That is, until I came along.",
  "SebastianSallow_14100": "I reminded him that Anne needs a cure. This 'scriptorium' could hold the answers we need.",
  "SebastianSallow_14103": "Unfortunately, only a Gaunt knows the location of the scriptorium's entrance and Ominis won't tell me.",
  "SebastianSallow_14104": "Every moment he isn't at Hogwarts he's with us in Feldcroft. Ominis trusts me. And, more often than not, he winds up listening to me.",
  "SebastianSallow_14106": "You've seen how he frets about the Dark Arts. I promise – I'll tell him when I've found the relic.",
  "SebastianSallow_14107": "When I know more, I shall send an owl.",
  "SebastianSallow_14108": "I'll be on my way.",
  "SebastianSallow_14110": "Anne is getting worse. If there is any chance that the relic from Slytherin's spellbook can help her, I must find it. I'm requesting your help. Meet me outside of Feldcroft, near the catacomb.",
  "SebastianSallow_14111": "– it's worthy of further study.",
  "SebastianSallow_14113": "From what I read in a report by the student, they weren't permitted to take it with them. So, I must assume it's still here.",
  "SebastianSallow_14118": "If it's in this catacomb, I have to find it. For Anne. I need to see her.",
  "SebastianSallow_14119": "I'm sure that foul smell is the scent of success – try not to lose your nerve just yet.",
  "SebastianSallow_14120": "This room is taller than it looks.",
  "SebastianSallow_14121": "We're here for a reason. I'd say opening them all is justified.",
  "SebastianSallow_14122": "Finding a chest in an inconspicuous loft – brilliant.",
  "SebastianSallow_14123": "Did you hear that?",
  "SebastianSallow_14126": "Watch your step. I nearly slipped there.",
  "SebastianSallow_14127": "If this archway's been barricaded, we can find a way through.",
  "SebastianSallow_14128": "That's a lot of bone rattle.",
  "SebastianSallow_14133": "Before we trudge on further, I've just realised something.",
  "SebastianSallow_14134": "The student's diary mentions the Imperius Curse. I wouldn't be surprised if we're going to need it here.",
  "SebastianSallow_14138": "So, if you'd like to learn <i>Imperio</i>, I can teach you.",
  "SebastianSallow_14139": "I taught myself. Don't tell Ominis that I've told you.",
  "SebastianSallow_14140": "It's not exactly something I can brag about, but it may come in handy. I think you ought to know it.",
  "SebastianSallow_14143": "Really? But we've no idea what may lie ahead.",
  "SebastianSallow_14145": "But I shan't press you. I'll have your back no matter what we face in there.",
  "SebastianSallow_14146": "I couldn't agree more. A spell that could save your life shouldn't be Unforgivable.",
  "SebastianSallow_14147": "Remember the Blasting Curse? Same idea, except, when it comes to Unforgivable Curses, your intention has to be clear.",
  "SebastianSallow_14149": "Here we go.",
  "SebastianSallow_14150": "Don't start.",
  "SebastianSallow_14151": "I've read about catacombs that underwent expansion efforts and ran into problems – often cave-ins.",
  "SebastianSallow_14153": "Perfect. By the way, Ominis has been asking about you. You didn't tell him what we were doing, did you?",
  "SebastianSallow_14156": "What did you find?",
  "SebastianSallow_14158": "Let's divide and conquer. You work on sorting out the bone barricades, I'll look around and see what we missed.",
  "SebastianSallow_14159": "Really? Interesting.",
  "SebastianSallow_14161": "There's more to this than even I imagined.",
  "SebastianSallow_14163": "Exactly. We'll be fine though.",
  "SebastianSallow_14166": "Never knew spiders could make such a mess.",
  "SebastianSallow_14168": "You have a lot at stake. You have an ability that evidently no one's seen for centuries.",
  "SebastianSallow_14169": "Another barricade? Considering how well you did on the last one, this should be a cinch.",
  "SebastianSallow_14170": "I try.",
  "SebastianSallow_14171": "This catacomb has suffered decay, just as the student summary described.",
  "SebastianSallow_14172": "You are head and shoulders above these bones. Nicely done.",
  "SebastianSallow_14173": "I see why Slytherin's student was so entranced with this place.",
  "SebastianSallow_14174": "Dead end. Lovely. All that for nothing.",
  "SebastianSallow_14180": "I have no idea, but we're here for the relic.",
  "SebastianSallow_14181": "Agreed. This is meant to be. For Anne's sake.",
  "SebastianSallow_14184": "Fine, but Ominis knows – I won't step back from a fight.",
  "SebastianSallow_14185": "I'm sorry, Ominis, but I'm taking it.",
  "SebastianSallow_14187": "The student summary referenced a space beyond the Great Room. Which means this can't be a dead end.",
  "SebastianSallow_14188": "We need to focus on moving beyond this room – but let me think for a moment.",
  "SebastianSallow_14190": "I didn't want a fight, but I didn't want this either.",
  "SebastianSallow_14191": "Very well. I'll teach you the Imperius Curse.",
  "SebastianSallow_14192": "Let me guess. Ominis is being as stubborn as ever.",
  "SebastianSallow_14193": "There's more where that came from. Been practising similar spells here for ages. Although, I didn't tell Anne and Ominis about every one.",
  "SebastianSallow_14195": "Well, when you do know, tell me. I've been studying archaic forms of magic for ages. Perhaps we can help each other.",
  "SebastianSallow_14196": "Dreadful way to go, poor fellow. Glad you and Fig are all right.",
  "SebastianSallow_14197": "Indeed. And how did you escape?",
  "SebastianSallow_14198": "Interesting perspective. How did you and Fig manage to escape?",
  "SebastianSallow_14199": "Didn't mean to press. You just get yourself settled. We can talk more later.",
  "SebastianSallow_14203": "You may be right. Very well. Probably best if I get away from here for a while. I'll head back to Hogwarts.",
  "SebastianSallow_14205": "What is it? I haven't changed my mind.",
  "SebastianSallow_14206": "What? Ominis?",
  "SebastianSallow_14207": "I'm through planning.",
  "SebastianSallow_14231": "Agreed.",
  "SebastianSallow_14232": "Something troubling ahead. Be on your guard.",
  "SebastianSallow_14233": "I had to stop that goblin from killing my sister! He has no right to banish me from my own twin!",
  "SebastianSallow_14235": "If he thinks banishing me means I'm going to give up on Anne, he's sorely mistaken.",
  "SebastianSallow_14239": "It's – we'd just lost our parents, and we were packing up to go and live with Solomon. We couldn't take everything.",
  "SebastianSallow_14245": "She was carefully organising her prized possessions – a box of artefacts she'd collected to do with our family. Jewellery, cards, old photographs.",
  "SebastianSallow_14246": "She got to her favourite, a hand-made crest, and without a second thought she handed it to me. 'This will keep you safe', she said.",
  "SebastianSallow_14251": "It holds no enchantment, but I've kept it with me since. That's how I can reach Anne. I'll get the crest to her with plans to meet.",
  "SebastianSallow_14253": "Nothing. Just a thought. Now I'm more determined than ever to learn what power that relic has.",
  "SebastianSallow_14256": "Even if Ominis is upset with us, he has no love lost for his family. He'd use their connections to the Headmaster if we needed his help.",
  "SebastianSallow_14258": "I know how it sounds, but if this can help you, it's worth the risk.",
  "SebastianSallow_14259": "What? Leave – ? Never mind. You need to stall him. Buy us time, Anne. Please.",
  "SebastianSallow_14260": "I can't believe my uncle wants to leave Feldcroft. Anne's going to stall him. She must. We need time.",
  "SebastianSallow_14266": "Charming.",
  "SebastianSallow_14267": "Ah. Almost as good as if I'd done it myself.",
  "SebastianSallow_14268": "Oh, I think three nudges at least.",
  "SebastianSallow_14269": "Annoying little beasts, aren't they?",
  "SebastianSallow_14270": "I don't think anyone's been here for ages.",
  "SebastianSallow_14271": "Is finding these chests luck or instinct?",
  "SebastianSallow_14272": "Can't get out of here quick enough.",
  "SebastianSallow_14273": "Did you find something?",
  "SebastianSallow_14276": "That was a piece of work.",
  "SebastianSallow_14277": "Good news?",
  "SebastianSallow_14278": "Nice work. Your skills never cease to surprise me.",
  "SebastianSallow_14279": "Well, you tried. That counts for something.",
  "SebastianSallow_14280": "But the triptych pointed us here.",
  "SebastianSallow_14281": "Could this be another area Isidora created?",
  "SebastianSallow_14283": "I wish you could see one of her memories.",
  "SebastianSallow_14284": "Perhaps completing the triptych will shed more light on all of this.",
  "SebastianSallow_14285": "I cannot believe the journey this triptych took us on.",
  "SebastianSallow_14287": "Don't keep me in suspense. Go on, place it!",
  "SebastianSallow_14288": "Fell in my first year and I still have nightmares.",
  "SebastianSallow_14289": "Don't want to risk another detention for getting back after hours.",
  "SebastianSallow_14290": "The door we came from – it closed, and there's more than one gate ahead.",
  "SebastianSallow_14291": "You seem to be in Ominis's favour – will you ask him about this?",
  "SebastianSallow_14294": "You found something?",
  "SebastianSallow_14295": "Without both of you, we'd never have made it this far.",
  "SebastianSallow_14296": "Ominis, about your aunt –",
  "SebastianSallow_14297": "The relic is the key to saving Anne – I know it. Meet me outside of Feldcroft as soon as you can.",
  "SebastianSallow_14300": "It'll be worth the risk.",
  "SebastianSallow_14301": "Our biggest hurdle may be convincing Ominis. Anne will only give this a chance if he's on board.",
  "SebastianSallow_14305": "Let me handle Ominis this time. As for my uncle, he's not an Auror anymore. What he doesn't know, well, won't hurt us.",
  "SebastianSallow_14308": "If he found out, I doubt he'd go to the Ministry. He didn't part ways with them well, from what I understand.",
  "SebastianSallow_14309": "He won't say, but I believe his strong aversion to Dark Magic has something to do with his time there.",
  "SebastianSallow_14310": "Anne thinks he once decided to 'fight fire with fire' so to speak and resorted to using an Unforgivable Curse in a fight against Dark wizards.",
  "SebastianSallow_14311": "At least that's what she thought she heard. When he realised what his job had led him to become, he left rather abruptly.",
  "SebastianSallow_14312": "So, I'm not sure he'd go to the Ministry to report on his own family using Dark Magic now.",
  "SebastianSallow_14318": "You're supposed to protect us!",
  "SebastianSallow_14320": "He gave up on Anne. I'll never give up on her.",
  "SebastianSallow_14322": "You saw him, didn't you? He was going to ruin her life! He attacked us. I – I had to use the Killing Curse. You know I did.",
  "SebastianSallow_14326": "I knew you'd understand. I did do the right thing.",
  "SebastianSallow_14328": "The Killing Curse won't be easy to master. As with all Unforgivables, you have to mean it.",
  "SebastianSallow_14331": "It worked. It's opening.",
  "SebastianSallow_14333": "Was about to do that myself, but you got to it first. Nice work.",
  "SebastianSallow_14337": "No. We've tried everyone from Nurse Blainey to St Mungo's.",
  "SebastianSallow_14338": "We certainly cleared the room.",
  "SebastianSallow_14339": "Look – bones stacked oddly on either side of this archway.",
  "SebastianSallow_14340": "Hold on to that diary entry. There may be more to it.",
  "SebastianSallow_14341": "Ominis – I'm –",
  "SebastianSallow_14342": "Ominis – I'm sorry.",
  "SebastianSallow_14347": "What? Turn me in? She saw what happened.",
  "SebastianSallow_14351": "Did you hear that? You saw what happened! I never wanted to hurt my uncle.",
  "SebastianSallow_14354": "Oh, Anne. I was only trying to help. I can't leave now. Anne needs me more than ever.",
  "SebastianSallow_14367": "I wouldn't put it past them. But I'm convinced that they were trying to hide something.",
  "SebastianSallow_14369": "Why will he not listen to me? She's my sister.",
  "SebastianSallow_14370": "They seem to have set up camp here for a specific reason. They have stations for everything.",
  "SebastianSallow_14371": "This is what we've been chasing?",
  "SebastianSallow_14372": "What is it?",
  "SebastianSallow_14373": "If you don't mind, I just need a moment alone.",
  "SebastianSallow_14376": "Please – I'm not myself right now.",
  "SebastianSallow_14377": "Let's meet later. At the Undercroft. All right?",
  "SebastianSallow_14378": "Well? What happened back there?",
  "SebastianSallow_14379": "Ominis simply needs a moment with you and he'll change his mind. Is that it?",
  "SebastianSallow_14380": "Did we do the wrong thing?",
  "SebastianSallow_14381": "I know. But not like this.",
  "SebastianSallow_14382": "I understand what you're saying. I do, but –",
  "SebastianSallow_14383": "How long will the spell last? How long must Ominis stay in the tomb?",
  "SebastianSallow_14384": "When we get to Feldcroft, I'd rather Anne not know what had to be done to get this relic.",
  "SebastianSallow_14385": "As we were leaving, Ominis wouldn't even acknowledge me. That's not like him.",
  "SebastianSallow_14386": "To the left is the Forbidden Forest. Out of bounds to all students.",
  "SebastianSallow_14387": "Ah, you can see Hogsmeade just past those ruins up ahead.",
  "SebastianSallow_14388": "Precisely. They think it's too dangerous. I think they need to have more confidence in our defensive abilities.",
  "SebastianSallow_14389": "I assume it's to do with what you told me – about the Portkey and Gringotts and Ranrok.",
  "SebastianSallow_14390": "I thought he understood. He knew we couldn't give up. All of this is too important. For Anne.",
  "SebastianSallow_14391": "I suppose with both Rookwood and Ranrok after you, a bit more time practising the Blasting Curse is in order.",
  "SebastianSallow_14392": "We've seen rune symbols like these before.",
  "SebastianSallow_14393": "Another rune symbol – feel as if I should be fluent in runic language by now.",
  "SebastianSallow_14394": "Glad you understand.",
  "SebastianSallow_14395": "His father's family are direct descendants of Salazar Slytherin – one of the four founders of Hogwarts.",
  "SebastianSallow_14396": "Obsessed with blood status, most of them. Ominis cannot abide them – as he'll be the first to tell you.",
  "SebastianSallow_14397": "He never confides in anyone – but he's trusted me since the day we met. I wouldn't want to jeopardise that.",
  "SebastianSallow_14398": "You shouldn't let your Disillusionment Charm lapse.",
  "SebastianSallow_14399": "We're in the clear. No need to stay invisible any longer.",
  "SebastianSallow_14400": "You can cast <i>Lumos</i> if you need to. Just be quiet about it.",
  "SebastianSallow_14401": "And we're much more fun to fight with.",
  "SebastianSallow_14402": "You Gryffindors don't have a monopoly on bravery, you know.",
  "SebastianSallow_14405": "I'll send you an owl when I have news.",
  "SebastianSallow_14406": "Still can't believe Ominis never told me about his aunt and what she found.",
  "SebastianSallow_14410": "Have a go at those candelabras.",
  "SebastianSallow_14411": "Spend as much time here as you'd like.",
  "SebastianSallow_14412": "This way.",
  "SebastianSallow_14413": "Feldcroft used to be a lot livelier.",
  "SebastianSallow_14414": "Here we are. My sister should be just inside.",
  "SebastianSallow_14415": "I miss my sister. And I'm going to get her back.",
  "SebastianSallow_14416": "Anne was always the most mischievous of the three of us. Which is saying something knowing me and Ominis.",
  "SebastianSallow_14417": "I'm hoping a surprise visit from me and a new friend from Hogwarts will help lift her spirits. Bring back the Anne I used to know.",
  "SebastianSallow_14418": "Come on. I'll take you to my uncle's.",
  "SebastianSallow_14419": "With Ranrok's lot wandering about all the time, everyone stays out of sight.",
  "SebastianSallow_14421": "Fair enough. Suppose I'm up for a challenge.",
  "SebastianSallow_14423": "We smelled smoke in the middle of the night. When we looked outside, flames were shooting from the estate.",
  "SebastianSallow_14424": "She came face to face with a horde of goblins frantically trying to stamp out the flames.",
  "SebastianSallow_14425": "Suddenly, an icy voice drifted out from somewhere in the smoke: 'Children should be seen and not heard.' A blinding blast followed.",
  "SebastianSallow_14426": "They didn't even give her a chance to run.",
  "SebastianSallow_14427": "Couldn't agree more.",
  "SebastianSallow_14428": "My thoughts exactly.",
  "SebastianSallow_14429": "Shall we have a look around?",
  "SebastianSallow_14432": "It might be worth taking a closer look at the house itself.",
  "SebastianSallow_14433": "What do you mean? When?",
  "SebastianSallow_14435": "'The Keepers'? Like in Quidditch? And you found a Pensieve in the library? I'm not following you.",
  "SebastianSallow_14437": "Who? What do you – ? ",
  "SebastianSallow_14438": "And now you've been witnessing memories left by 'Keepers'?",
  "SebastianSallow_14439": "Let's see what we can find.",
  "SebastianSallow_14440": "This is where it happened.",
  "SebastianSallow_14441": "Hm. A stairwell.",
  "SebastianSallow_14444": "But – you said you didn't really understand it – and that you couldn't wield it.",
  "SebastianSallow_14446": "Wait – we can get straight to the Undercroft from here? Ominis will be floored.",
  "SebastianSallow_14447": "Understood. Well, then. Invisible, secret, ancient magic passageway, here we come.",
  "SebastianSallow_14448": "I don't know what I was expecting you to say, but it wasn't that. I knew you weren't telling me everything. 'Ancient magic'? What does that even mean?",
  "SebastianSallow_14449": "I'm tempted to hold my breath.",
  "SebastianSallow_14451": "No idea. Ominis just learned of it. I'll let you know what I find out.",
  "SebastianSallow_14453": "Hmm. Very well. But, that doesn't mean it's not ancient magic. There's still so much we don't know about it.",
  "SebastianSallow_14454": "And remember: keep this place between us.",
  "SebastianSallow_14455": "It has. Glad you received my owl. I have something to show you.",
  "SebastianSallow_14465": "And you can wield it?",
  "SebastianSallow_14466": "Are you telling me that goblins may be wielding some sort of wizard magic?",
  "SebastianSallow_14468": "I'll be in touch. Till then.",
  "SebastianSallow_14472": "This is the view painted on the canvas  that was left on it.",
  "SebastianSallow_14477": "She loved that infernal game. What I wouldn't give to lose to her again –",
  "SebastianSallow_14478": "I confess, that was a bit more than I'd bargained for.",
  "SebastianSallow_14479": "I tried to warn you.",
  "SebastianSallow_14483": "Glad you could make it. Lucan's just over there.",
  "SebastianSallow_14484": "Which is what, precisely?",
  "SebastianSallow_14485": "How perceptive. Thank you.",
  "SebastianSallow_14486": "This can't be your first duel.",
  "SebastianSallow_14487": "I finally realised what it was that struck me about that triptych.",
  "SebastianSallow_14489": "I'd been so distracted by the scriptorium and Slytherin's book that I'd almost forgotten what it was that had struck me about that triptych.",
  "SebastianSallow_14492": "If you want to get the most out of your time at Hogwarts, you're going to need to break the rules now and then.",
  "SebastianSallow_14493": "Whether it's joining a secret duelling club or sneaking into the Restricted Section of the Library –",
  "SebastianSallow_14494": "Good. Pleasure chatting with you. I'm sure I'll see you soon.",
  "SebastianSallow_14495": "Perhaps somewhere 'unsanctioned'. We'll see if your performance today was sheer luck – or actual skill.",
  "SebastianSallow_14496": "Look for Lucan Brattleby near the Clock Tower Entrance. If you're interested.",
  "SebastianSallow_14497": "I've never seen Mr Moon in such a state.",
  "SebastianSallow_14498": "You're being awfully cryptic.",
  "SebastianSallow_14502": "I'd been so preoccupied by all that happened with Ominis in the catacomb – not to mention my uncle's reaction – that I'd almost forgotten what it was that had struck me about that triptych.",
  "SebastianSallow_14505": "And while I was waiting for you, I scouted around and discovered an abandoned mine nearby – surrounded by Ranrok's Loyalists.",
  "SebastianSallow_14509": "A rune symbol – above the cavern door.",
  "SebastianSallow_14510": "Now. We can have a look around in peace.",
  "SebastianSallow_14511": "We should clear out these spider webs – they always seem to be in the way.",
  "SebastianSallow_14512": "These runes must be connected somehow – try casting at them more quickly.",
  "SebastianSallow_14518": "Why?",
  "SebastianSallow_14522": "Who is that?",
  "SebastianSallow_14523": "Perhaps try casting at them in a different order – and be as quick as you can.",
  "SebastianSallow_14525": "Don't think I've forgotten about your goblin friend. I haven't. But I needed to tell you what I've learned.",
  "SebastianSallow_14529": "If I have to keep proving that to my uncle, I will. He cannot banish me from my own home. From my sister.",
  "SebastianSallow_14532": "How are they still one step ahead of us? They can't know about the triptych.",
  "SebastianSallow_14535": "But it's been abandoned ever since Ranrok took hold of the coast.",
  "SebastianSallow_14538": "Both have their uses, but I think you'll find that a <i>Confringo</i> cast travels a bit farther than that of a spell like <i>Incendio</i>.",
  "SebastianSallow_14539": "These 'Keepers' are playing games with you. You need to press them for more information.",
  "SebastianSallow_14547": "Still – something about this place feels odd.",
  "SebastianSallow_14548": "And why hide it behind cryptic rune symbols – and ancient magic that no one but you could see?",
  "SebastianSallow_14553": "This is all rather baffling. Let's take the canvas back to the triptych. Perhaps the answers are there.",
  "SebastianSallow_14554": "This place is odd, to be sure, but I'm fascinated by it.",
  "SebastianSallow_14555": "I've not forgotten about our library venture – how did you fare? If you're keen for some illicit spell practice, meet me outside the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom. I know a discreet place near there.",
  "SebastianSallow_14558": "Look out!",
  "SebastianSallow_14559": "Watch out!",
  "SebastianSallow_14560": "What was that?",
  "SebastianSallow_14561": "Nicely done!",
  "SebastianSallow_14562": "Keep at it! We'll wear him down eventually.",
  "SebastianSallow_14563": "That's right, you lumbering lout!",
  "SebastianSallow_14564": "A few more hits should do the job!",
  "SebastianSallow_14565": "I'll go and see what he wants.",
  "SebastianSallow_14566": "Ready for another round?",
  "SebastianSallow_14567": "There's no one in the school I'd be afraid to duel.",
  "SebastianSallow_14568": "They should not be underestimated.",
  "SebastianSallow_14569": "Nice work.",
  "SebastianSallow_14570": "She took away the pain.",
  "SebastianSallow_14571": "I knew it. I knew there was a way to help Anne.",
  "SebastianSallow_14572": "What do you mean? You saw what she did.",
  "SebastianSallow_14573": "I don’t follow.",
  "SebastianSallow_14574": "So, someone destroyed a bit of enchanted canvas –",
  "SebastianSallow_14575": "– but we found the memory.",
  "SebastianSallow_14576": "We saw what she wanted us to see. We saw what she could do. What you can do!",
  "SebastianSallow_14577": "Well, then you shall learn. The Keepers can teach you.",
  "SebastianSallow_14578": "If at all?",
  "SebastianSallow_14579": "You've overcome all of their challenges. You've more than proven yourself.",
  "SebastianSallow_14580": "You can wield it. You have the ability.",
  "SebastianSallow_14581": "Please. Talk to the Keepers. If not for me, then for Anne.",
  "SebastianSallow_14582": "Well, fancy meeting you here.",
  "SebastianSallow_14583": "Quickly. We need to do something to distract her.",
  "SebastianSallow_14584": "Mr Hill was just singing your praises.",
  "SebastianSallow_14585": "Understood. We can talk more in a moment. In the Undercroft. Not even the professors know about this place.",
  "SebastianSallow_14586": "Did you find what you were looking for?",
  "SebastianSallow_14591": "As I mentioned, my sister Anne misses Hogwarts and she hasn't been herself lately. I'd like to take you up on your promise to visit her with me.",
  "SebastianSallow_14592": "I'm heading to Feldcroft soon, so I'll look forward to seeing you there. It's just south of Hogwarts.",
  "SebastianSallow_14595": "Fair enough.",
  "SebastianSallow_14596": "I'm the one trying to help her. He's simply given up.",
  "SebastianSallow_14597": "Before my uncle and I could stop her, Anne rushed out – racing towards the fire. Worried someone'd be hurt.",
  "SebastianSallow_14600": "She misses Hogwarts. She's been stuck at home with our guardian – Uncle Solomon. Unfortunately, you'll have to meet him too.",
  "SebastianSallow_14601": "Meeting a new student will be precisely what she needs.",
  "SebastianSallow_14602": "She misses Hogwarts. She's been stuck at home with our guardian – Uncle Solomon. Unfortunately, you'll have to meet him too.",
  "SebastianSallow_14612": "Brilliant. Someone's trapped in that well.",
  "SebastianSallow_14613": "Well if it isn't the tree from the map you found in that well.",
  "SebastianSallow_14614": "I know where he is. I'll lead you to him and then leave you to it. Come on.",
  "SebastianSallow_14615": "Following floating candles into the Forbidden Forest? Well, then. After you.",
  "SebastianSallow_14616": "Not a bad reward for a little stroll through the Forest.",
  "SebastianSallow_14617": "You knew? And didn't tell me?",
  "SebastianSallow_14618": "Looks like a locked door. We may want to look around.",
  "SebastianSallow_14619": "There may be something to this pile of rubble.",
  "SebastianSallow_14623": "Must be something around here somewhere.",
  "SebastianSallow_14624": "There's no clear way forward.",
  "SebastianSallow_14625": "Well. Let's see where the thing leads us, shall we?",
  "SebastianSallow_14626": "You'll be the height of fashion.",
  "SebastianSallow_14627": "Those are certainly monstrous.",
  "SebastianSallow_14636": "Quickly. Let's get inside the Three Broomsticks.",
  "SebastianSallow_14637": "What was that goblin doing with Victor Rookwood?",
  "SebastianSallow_14638": "The goblin from the <i>Daily Prophet</i>? I knew I'd seen him somewhere!",
  "SebastianSallow_14639": "Did they see us?",
  "SebastianSallow_14647": "I'd imagine we'd need to find all three rune symbols to open the door.",
  "SebastianSallow_14670": "Hm – perhaps try <i>Reparo</i>.",
  "SebastianSallow_14674": "Perhaps we can mend the bridge to get across the chasm.",
  "SebastianSallow_14675": "<i>Reparo</i> may be the answer here.",
  "SebastianSallow_14684": "Let's look at the gate and the symbols again.",
  "SebastianSallow_14685": "Excellent work. We're another step closer to the scriptorium.",
  "SebastianSallow_14687": "It seems the dial moves faster than before. Perhaps check you're matching the correct symbols.",
  "SebastianSallow_14688": "I spotted something ahead. Looks troubling.",
  "SebastianSallow_14690": "You can see traces of an ancient magic that you think Ranrok is trying to harness. And now you've been witnessing memories left by 'Keepers'?",
  "SebastianSallow_14692": "We shall have to keep a look out for more of these. I wonder how many there are.",
  "SebastianSallow_14693": "Damn.",
  "SebastianSallow_14700": "Perhaps we can find something to levitate.",
  "SebastianSallow_14703": "I know that coast. Ranrok has taken over a huge mine and the surrounding area. Marunweem has suffered for it. It's as bad as Feldcroft's become.",
  "SebastianSallow_14704": "Should we head there now?",
  "SebastianSallow_14706": "Oh! And this house belonged to a Hogwarts professor – who was one of these non-Quidditch Keepers – hundreds of years ago.",
  "SebastianSallow_14707": "Let me see if I've got this straight. You have Ranrok and Rookwood after you because of something you found at Gringotts – where you ended up via a Portkey.",
  "SebastianSallow_14708": "If I didn't know you, I'd think you were pulling my leg.",
  "SebastianSallow_14709": "Honestly? Nothing you say sounds strange to me anymore.",
  "SebastianSallow_14710": "I'm listening.",
  "SebastianSallow_14711": "You said that goblins may be wielding some form of this ancient magic. Do you think Anne was cursed by ancient magic?",
  "SebastianSallow_14712": "Did I mention that, apparently, Salazar Slytherin had a secret scriptorium here in Hogwarts?",
  "SebastianSallow_14713": "I had no idea our visit to see Anne would unfold into all of this. My head's an utter mess. But I'm glad you told me everything you did.",
  "SebastianSallow_14714": "Ah. There's that Hufflepuff loyalty you're so well-known for.",
  "SebastianSallow_14715": "For a Ravenclaw, you certainly have a lot to learn.",
  "SebastianSallow_14717": "The good news is, I do, in fact.",
  "SebastianSallow_14718": "Rackham. I haven't heard his name before.",
  "SebastianSallow_14719": "She seems to have been everywhere.",
  "SebastianSallow_14720": "A friendly goblin?",
  "SebastianSallow_14721": "Not all goblins what? Have you forgotten Feldcroft? Have you forgotten the mine we just went through?",
  "SebastianSallow_14722": "Oh, I do know when to stop.",
  "SebastianSallow_14723": "Try casting at them more quickly – or in a different order.",
  "SebastianSallow_14726": "That troll certainly made a mess of things. Debris everywhere.",
  "SebastianSallow_14727": "I think there's a path up there, but the stairs are in a shambles.",
  "SebastianSallow_14728": "Try mending the stairs. <i>Reparo</i> should work.",
  "SebastianSallow_14729": "We couldn't jump high enough to reach that ledge if we tried.",
  "SebastianSallow_14730": "We need something sturdy to stand on.",
  "SebastianSallow_14731": "Try levitating that crate to the right spot.",
  "SebastianSallow_14732": "This can't be a dead end. Must be another floor above us.",
  "SebastianSallow_14733": "I'm out of breath after all of those stairs. But the view – well worth it.",
  "SebastianSallow_14734": "Bit of a cave in.",
  "SebastianSallow_14735": "I see light coming from behind that wall. Likely a way through.",
  "SebastianSallow_14736": "<i>Bombarda</i> may be the way to go.",
  "SebastianSallow_14738": "Must be something around here that can help.",
  "SebastianSallow_14739": "Perhaps the symbols on another gate will match this dial.",
  "SebastianSallow_14740": "The student mentioned bones as the key. Therefore, bone piles must be what we need.",
  "SebastianSallow_14741": "Try using <i>Accio</i> to bring that bone pile to the archway.",
  "SebastianSallow_14742": "I've been studying Salazar Slytherin's spellbook. Meet me in the Undercroft. I've found something.",
  "SebastianSallow_14744": "Ugh. Either they don't trust you or you don't care enough about Anne to ask the difficult questions!",
  "SebastianSallow_14745": "Fine. I'll defer to your Keeper friends. For now. But I don't like it.",
  "SebastianSallow_14746": "That's – that's not what I meant. I – we're just not getting answers. I need answers. For Anne.",
  "SebastianSallow_14747": "Wait? For what? Ugh. Why are you suddenly so cautious?",
  "SebastianSallow_14748": "I thought we wanted the same thing.",
  "SebastianSallow_14749": "Fine. Fine. I'm sorry. I'm letting my emotions get the better of me. And I have been for a while.",
  "SebastianSallow_14750": "I do trust you. And I don't think I can help Anne without you.",
  "SebastianSallow_14751": "Why couldn't she have kept all of her journal entries in one place?",
  "SebastianSallow_14752": "I suppose talking to that magic well paid off in the end.",
  "SebastianSallow_14753": "Isidora should not have had to keep all of this secret.",
  "SebastianSallow_14754": "The brazier – when the door closed it lit up.",
  "SebastianSallow_14755": "The way through – it's open.",
  "SebastianSallow_14761": "I'm glad you came.",
  "SebastianSallow_14762": "I was hoping to see you. Spare a moment?",
  "SebastianSallow_14766": "Don't think I've forgotten about your goblin friend. I haven't. But Ominis won't help me so perhaps you can.",
  "SebastianSallow_14769": "Don't think I've forgotten about your goblin friend. I haven't. But Ominis won't help me so I'm hoping you still can.",
  "SebastianSallow_14770": "Don't think I've forgotten about your goblin friend. I haven't. But I needed to tell you what I've learned.",
  "SebastianSallow_14774": "As I mentioned earlier, this relic grants its holder the power to reverse Dark Magic curses.",
  "SebastianSallow_14778": "I'd wager the sarcophagi can be opened.",
  "SebastianSallow_14779": "The student summary referenced a space beyond the Great Room. Which means this can't be a dead end. I have the report if you want to have a look.",
  "SebastianSallow_14780": "Of course.",
  "SebastianSallow_14781": "Have a look. Unfortunately, there's no name on it. But, I surmise if it was important enough for Slytherin to stash in his spellbook –",
  "SebastianSallow_14782": "Brilliant.",
  "SebastianSallow_14783": "– it's worthy of further study.",
  "SebastianSallow_14785": "Slytherin mentioned a student who excelled in Charms and always carried a satchel stuffed full of notes.",
  "SebastianSallow_14786": "They might have been left on purpose. Or, the student may have simply dropped them.",
  "SebastianSallow_14787": "You've done it!",
  "SebastianSallow_14788": "It's an Unforgivable, but useful when you're outnumbered. Places the victim completely under the caster's control.",
  "SebastianSallow_14789": "You have to mean it.",
  "SebastianSallow_14790": "Hmm. This looks different than what we faced before. Now we're also dealing with rune symbols.",
  "SebastianSallow_14791": "Focus your wand movement. It's not an easy spell to master.",
  "SebastianSallow_14792": "Appears some of these stone tablets have two rune symbols. That has to mean something.",
  "SebastianSallow_14793": "Perhaps we need to pull the handles in the order of the symbols on the tablets.",
  "SebastianSallow_14794": "That worked. Keep going.",
  "SebastianSallow_14795": "I assure you, we were meant to find this. For Anne's sake.",
  "SebastianSallow_14796": "Is that – Ominis?",
  "SebastianSallow_14797": "What did you do?",
  "SebastianSallow_14798": "What happened with Ominis?",
  "SebastianSallow_14799": "When it comes to Unforgivable Curses, your intention must be clear. You have to mean it.",
  "SebastianSallow_14800": "Focus your wand movement.",
  "SebastianSallow_14801": "There has to be more to it than that. Tell me.",
  "SebastianSallow_14802": "I hope he knows that hasn't changed.",
  "SebastianSallow_14803": "We've always looked out for each other – Ominis and I.",
  "SebastianSallow_14804": "I never wanted to keep all this from Ominis.",
  "SebastianSallow_14805": "He just – doesn't understand. And I didn't want to worry him all over again.",
  "SebastianSallow_14806": "She thinks like Ominis. It'd only upset her.",
  "SebastianSallow_14807": "How can you say that? You just used the Imperius Curse on Ominis.",
  "SebastianSallow_14808": "Find me in the Undercroft when you have news. And, thank you.",
  "SebastianSallow_14809": "Don't think I've forgotten about your goblin friend. I haven't. But I appreciate you setting our earlier discussion aside for now.",
  "SebastianSallow_14811": "I should send the crest to Anne. She'll know that we need to meet.",
  "SebastianSallow_14812": "Thank you. I very much appreciate you standing by me through all of this.",
  "SebastianSallow_14814": "Don't think I've forgotten about your goblin friend. I haven't. But I appreciate you setting our earlier discussion aside for now.",
  "SebastianSallow_14815": "I shall let you know when the four of us should meet at the catacomb. Look for my owl.",
  "SebastianSallow_14820": "Hold your wand steady. Focus. The incantation is <i>Avada Kedavra</i>.",
  "SebastianSallow_14821": "Your intention must be clear.",
  "SebastianSallow_14823": "I'm taking it. Let's get to Feldcroft.",
  "SebastianSallow_14825": "Rowland's in the wrong business entirely. In my opinion.",
  "SebastianSallow_14826": "Adelaide mentioned her uncle Rowland's camp may lie near Brocburrow – past the river.",
  "SebastianSallow_14827": "If this is Mr Oakes's campsite, we're in for trouble.",
  "SebastianSallow_14828": "We could tiptoe around or take them head on. You know which I'd choose.",
  "SebastianSallow_14829": "If Mr Oakes was here, there's no sign of him now.",
  "SebastianSallow_14830": "Oakes is an experienced trader. He marked that map for a reason.",
  "SebastianSallow_14831": "His journal left behind? This can't be good.",
  "SebastianSallow_14832": "The nerve – taking over a castle. Be wary. There'll be more of them.",
  "SebastianSallow_14833": "Blast. A part of me had hoped it'd be cheerier on the inside.",
  "SebastianSallow_14834": "Boiler doors usually need to be lit to operate. This one's probably no exception.",
  "SebastianSallow_14835": "That furnace could be promising.",
  "SebastianSallow_14836": "Try lighting that furnace. It must be connected to the boiler door.",
  "SebastianSallow_14837": "I saw a boiler door on our way down. Perhaps we should take a closer look there.",
  "SebastianSallow_14852": "Trust me. It's not as easy as you might assume – thinking straight when you've been hit with <i>Crucio</i>.",
  "SebastianSallow_14853": "I – never mind.",
  "SebastianSallow_14855": "We have some spectators. The trials are popular.",
  "SebastianSallow_14856": "That's why we had to use <i>Crucio</i> to gain access to the scriptorium. He didn't want his knowledge shared with anyone who was afraid of the power of Dark Magic.",
  "SebastianSallow_14857": "References to a lost relic which, from what I can tell, grants the holder the power to reverse Dark Magic curses.",
  "SebastianSallow_14858": "Good. Ominis would be livid if he knew what we were about to do.",
  "SebastianSallow_14859": "I shall make my uncle see reason. He cannot banish me from my own home. From my sister.",
  "SebastianSallow_14860": "That brazier went out on its own. I wonder if it's a clue.",
  "SebastianSallow_14862": "Mr Oakes was lucky. Ranrok's lot would never have freed him.",
  "SebastianSallow_14863": "I saw movement higher up in the keep. We should find our way there.",
  "SebastianSallow_14864": "A ladder – that's what we need.",
  "SebastianSallow_14865": "That's one way of expressing yourself.",
  "SebastianSallow_14869": "Bold spell choice. I won't tell.",
  "SebastianSallow_14870": "Was rubbish anyway, I'm sure.",
  "SebastianSallow_14871": "I might've done the same.",
  "SebastianSallow_14872": "Perfectly good thing to spend your Galleons on – a new broom. I'm almost jealous.",
  "SebastianSallow_14889": "What are we getting into now?",
  "SebastianSallow_14890": "Had it in for that one, didn't you?",
  "SebastianSallow_14893": "Well! That was impressive.",
  "SebastianSallow_14917": "The fewer Ashwinders about, the better.",
  "SebastianSallow_14918": "Every beast will be better off now.",
  "SebastianSallow_14919": "All of Ranrok's Loyalists deserve the same fate. Nice work.",
  "SebastianSallow_14920": "We've rid the world of another spider. I shall sleep better tonight.",
  "SebastianSallow_14921": "Even with their height advantage, no troll stands a chance against you.",
  "SebastianSallow_14942": "Let me help you.",
  "SebastianSallow_14943": "I have my uses.",
  "SebastianSallow_14952": "Mind your grasp – and don't look down.",
  "SebastianSallow_14953": "Lost your broom?",
  "SebastianSallow_14954": "That spell got my attention.",
  "SebastianSallow_14956": "Not sure what I did to deserve that.",
  "SebastianSallow_14978": "Pardon you.",
  "SebastianSallow_14981": "Another barrier. We can blast through it, I'm certain.",
  "SebastianSallow_14982": "I – could teach you.",
  "SebastianSallow_14983": "Of course. I – I can't think right now. I need to leave.",
  "SebastianSallow_14984": "I – I can't think right now. I need to leave.",
  "SebastianSallow_14985": "If I hadn't known how to cast it –",
  "SebastianSallow_14986": "I can't believe he's gone. How did things go so wrong? I didn't mean it. I didn't mean to –",
  "SebastianSallow_14987": "I did it for her.",
  "SebastianSallow_14988": "You understand. You can talk to Ominis. Make him understand. He listens to you. I need to be with Anne.",
  "SebastianSallow_14989": "You don't know? You do know. Anne has no one. I regret everything I did. I know what I did was wrong.",
  "SebastianSallow_14990": "I only hope she can forgive me – that everyone can forgive me.",
  "SebastianSallow_14991": "Thank you. You're a good friend. Truly.",
  "SebastianSallow_15001": "We need to find the tomb near Brocburrow and place Samantha's family crest on a sarcophagus there.",
  "SebastianSallow_15002": "Seems our feet haven't been cursed. That's a good sign, I suppose.",
  "SebastianSallow_15003": "I was not expecting to find a troll here. Although I shouldn't be surprised.",
  "SebastianSallow_15004": "Samantha will be glad to hear that the crest has been returned. I certainly hope it reverses the curse.",
  "SebastianSallow_15005": "I suppose we know what happened to Mary Portman now. She was breeding the spiders.",
  "SebastianSallow_15006": "This must be Aranshire. We'd better keep an eye out for spiders.",
  "SebastianSallow_15007": "A ladder. Not sure I want to know where this leads.",
  "SebastianSallow_15008": "That's the last of the spider sacs.",
  "SebastianSallow_15009": "I hope that's the last spider.",
  "SebastianSallow_15010": "Well done. I believe it's dead.",
  "SebastianSallow_15026": "Glad Weasley spoke for him – she honoured him well. Fig will be well remembered.",
  "SebastianSallow_15027": "I – realise the same should be done for my uncle. I hope Anne agrees to see me.",
  "SebastianSallow_15030": "Wait. What – what are you saying?",
  "SebastianSallow_15031": "Till then.",
  "SebastianSallow_15032": "I can't blame her. I couldn't really blame any of you if you gave up on me entirely. You all believed in me. And I let you all down.",
  "SebastianSallow_15034": "I'm glad you came to Hogwarts.",
  "SebastianSallow_15035": "Can't believe we lost Fig. I didn't know him as well as you did, but I know he was a good man.",
  "SebastianSallow_15036": "I – wish the same could have been done for my uncle. I wonder if there's a chance Anne would meet me.",
  "SebastianSallow_15037": "I heard a rumour that he confronted you outside of Ollivanders. Sounds as if you faced quite a fight.",
  "SebastianSallow_15038": "This – this can't be. It was the Loyalists. It's always been them. The night Anne was cursed, all she saw were goblins.",
  "SebastianSallow_15039": "So he cursed her. And she's never been the same. So cruel. Rookwood deserved what he got.",
  "SebastianSallow_15041": "Thank you for telling me. It wasn't a goblin. I suppose I owe you an apology.",
  "SebastianSallow_15042": "As for what happened in the catacomb – I've not stopped thinking about it. Perhaps we could meet soon. There's much I wish to say.",
  "SebastianSallow_15043": "Ominis said he's spoken with Anne – I wonder if she'll see me. I'll find out and send word when I know more.",
  "SebastianSallow_15044": "I've thought about what you told me in the Great Hall. I would like to speak with you. Meet me in the Undercroft as soon as you can.",
  "SebastianSallow_15045": "Ominis spoke with Anne about what happened with my uncle Solomon. She believes I should pay for what I did.",
  "SebastianSallow_15046": "The thing is – I think I've lost my sister, my twin, forever. She refuses to even see me.",
  "SebastianSallow_15050": "I hope you're right.",
  "SebastianSallow_15051": "I realise I can't undo what's been done, but I can try every day to make up for it. I owe you and Ominis everything for standing by me.",
  "SebastianSallow_15052": "But, she won't turn me in. She said the guilt I'll have to live with is punishment enough.",
  "SebastianSallow_15053": "I am glad for that. But I still have hopes that Anne may in time understand what happened and come to forgive me.",
  "SebastianSallow_15054": "Seems so long ago. Thank you. I have no idea what's to come, but I am grateful for your friendship.",
  "SebastianSallow_15055": "I hope so. I – I'll let you know.",
  "SebastianSallow_15056": "Glad Weasley spoke for him – she honoured him well. Fig will be well remembered.",
  "SebastianSallow_15057": "All this time I thought goblins were the enemy. But it was never that simple.",
  "SebastianSallow_15058": "I have a lot to think about. Let's speak again soon.",
  "SebastianSallow_15059": "Be on your guard.",
  "SebastianSallow_15084": "He does. No idea how though. Ominis was born blind, and no spell could reverse it.",
  "SebastianSallow_15085": "His wand seems almost sentient. Not surprising I suppose. Ollivander always says, 'the wand chooses the wizard.'",
  "SebastianSallow_15086": "Of course, you can use <i>Accio</i> on humans. If you're so inclined.",
  "SilvanusSelwyn_10099": "Can't believe you'd take such a risk. Rookwood'll be thrilled when I tell him I've nabbed you.",
  "SilvanusSelwyn_10100": "No one tells me where I can and cannot set up camp.",
  "SilvanusSelwyn_10101": "What are you lot doing? This is a proper operation, not some schoolyard scheme.",
  "SilvanusSelwyn_10102": "I'll let you know when you can have some rest.",
  "SilvanusSelwyn_10103": "We've got those buffoons in Cragcroft to extort. Get to it.",
  "SilvanusSelwyn_10106": "No one tells me where I can and cannot set up camp.",
  "SirCadogan_10000": "Back, back, you boor! I’ve no time for idle chatter.",
  "SirCadogan_10001": "Ah, good sirs and gentle ladies, where are we off to today?",
  "SirCadogan_10002": "By Merlin, I will no sooner tolerate indolence than insolence! Neither makes for a knight worthy of esteem.",
  "SirCadogan_10003": "Call upon Sir Cadogan, if ever you require a champion of the realm!",
  "SirCadogan_10004": "Do not judge a steed by its size, for size is not stature.",
  "SirCadogan_10005": "Keep on, keep on, young scholars.",
  "SirCadogan_10006": "Off to couch a hogshead, I presume?",
  "SirCadogan_10007": "Stand back, you knaves! Know you not who I am?",
  "SirCadogan_10008": "Scoundrels and rogues, the lot of them!",
  "SirCadogan_10009": "Do not look so pitchkettled. No quest without challenge is a quest worth completing.",
  "SirCadogan_10010": "Many an adversary has underestimated my adroitness with a sword.",
  "SirCadogan_10011": "You rapscallions are surely up to no good! Off with you!",
  "SirCadogan_10012": "Mayhap you scallywags have come to witness my valour. I shall not disappoint!",
  "SirCadogan_10013": "No one likes a cox-comb. Humility is one of my greatest attributes.",
  "SirCadogan_10014": "What ho! It is I, Sir Cadogan, slayer of Wyvern of Wye!",
  "SirCadogan_10015": "Pray thee – no time to dally? Be on your merry way. I shall see you anon.",
  "SirCadogan_10016": "Fear not, my young comrades-in-arms! For I am of stout heart and will not perish easily in battle.",
  "SirCadogan_10017": "Too afraid to fight, you scurvy cur? Ha! I daresay you’ve heard of my proficiency with a blade.",
  "SirCadogan_10018": "Do not dally, young friends. Fortune waits not for the slothful.",
  "SirCadogan_10019": "Sir Cadogan, at your service.",
  "SirCadogan_10020": "Are we at war? Take my flank! I have them!",
  "SirCadogan_10021": "Been caught unawares? Stay valiant!",
  "SirCadogan_10022": "Sinister magic afoot. My sword has the might of a thousand wands!",
  "SirCadogan_10024": "Who goes there? I know the ways of Godric Gryffindor. Stand down!",
  "SirCadogan_10025": "Who goes there? Shallow footsteps shall not pass by me unnoticed.",
  "SirCadogan_10026": "No dragon goes after my steed and lives to see morn.",
  "SirCadogan_10027": "Walk with pride, and none will fear you.",
  "SirCadogan_10028": "Fear not, I mean no harm to those with gentle spirit.",

  "SirNestorAmset_10011": "Hmph.",
  "SirNestorAmset_10012": "Who will be next to play our little game of hide and seek amongst the pumpkins?",
  "SirNestorAmset_10015": "Have you forgotten already? Just destroy the pumpkins until you find his head.",
  "SirNestorAmset_10023": "Well, if you must know, Jackdaw's our newest member, so we like to put him through his paces.",
  "SirNestorAmset_10025": "I was executed alongside some fellow mutineers. We didn't like the way things were being run in our county, so we took matters into our own hands.",
  "SirNestorAmset_10030": "It's simple, really: find his head in the pumpkins.",
  "SirNestorAmset_10031": "Keep looking until you find Jackdaw.",
  "SirNestorAmset_10032": "You'll get it. Keep swinging away with that wand of yours.",
  "SirNestorAmset_10033": "Not bad, but you'll have to try again.",
  "SirNestorAmset_10034": "Give it another shot, eh?",
  "SirNestorAmset_10035": "Jackdaw's just waiting to be found. Have another go.",
  "SirNestorAmset_10036": "You'll never get anywhere if you give up like that. Try again. We've got all night.",
  "SirNestorAmset_10037": "Treason is such a strong word, but that's what we were found guilty of. Things would have turned out much better if they'd let me be in charge.",
  "SirNestorAmset_10040": "Remember: the game's not over until you find him five times.",
  "SirNestorAmset_10041": "It's simple, really. Just try to find Jackdaw's head amongst these pumpkins. Not once, though: three times.",
  "SirNestorAmset_10042": "It's simple, really. Just try to find Jackdaw's head amongst these pumpkins. Not once, though: four times.",
  "SirNestorAmset_10043": "It's simple, really. Just try to find Jackdaw's head amongst these pumpkins. Not once, though: several times.",
  "SirNestorAmset_10044": "It's simple, really. Just try to find Jackdaw's head amongst these pumpkins. Not once, though: six times.",

  "SirNestorAmset_10053": "Begin! Cast away until you find him.",
  "SirNestorAmset_10054": "Ah. Sir Nicholas's young friend. Has he abandoned you?",
  "SirNestorAmset_10055": "Indeed it might be. Hmm. It is a bit unorthodox to include a mortal – but – if you do wish to speak with him –",
  "SirNestorAmset_10056": "– oh, why not? You can speak with Jackdaw – if you can find his head amongst these pumpkins.",
  "SirNestorAmset_10057": "Not just once, but five times. Good ol' Dumfrey will move the head to a different spot each time you find it.",
  "SirNestorAmset_10058": "Those are the rules. What say you?",
  "SirNestorAmset_10059": "Marvellous. Course, a mortal holding a wand has an advantage over us ghosts. You can simply blast away to your heart's content.",
  "SirNestorAmset_10060": "Well done. Of course, having a wand served you well. Still, I believe congratulations are in order.",
  "SirNestorAmset_10061": "You'll have to play our game. Find him amongst the pumpkins five times and he's all yours.",
  "SirNestorAmset_10062": "Find his head amongst the pumpkins five times. Use your wand. I cannot be more specific than that.",

  "Sirona_10358": "I'll say it again: can't thank you enough for helping to save the village from those trolls.",
  "Sirona_10362": "There's no love lost for Ferdinand trust me, but – destroying his frame might've been a bit unnecessary.",
  "Sirona_10381": "She's lovely. Her late husband, Aidan, was a friend of my father's. In fact, I'd stay with Dot and Aidan the summers I waited tables here as a student.",
  "Sirona_10383": "Dot's a skilled potioneer. She's been supplying travelling vendors with Wiggenweld Potion –",
  "Sirona_10384": "– an ordinary precaution that has, unfortunately, become a necessity what with Ranrok's Loyalists disrupting the trade routes.",
  "Sirona_10387": "I've seen her a few times since Aidan passed, but the pub's been so busy lately, I've not been as attentive as I'd have liked.",
  "Sirona_10390": "It would mean the world to me – and to Dorothy.",
  "Sirona_10391": "Aidan was bringing the box of letters to me when he was taken ill. Dot can tell you where he might have dropped it.",
  "Sirona_10394": "Yes, my friend Dorothy Sprottle in Upper Hogsfield – north of Hogsmeade.",
  "Sirona_10395": "Her husband Aidan recently passed away and she needs help collecting Horklumps. I'd also hoped you could find my box of letters.",
  "Sirona_10397": "Ah! Glad you came.",
  "Sirona_10400": "It’s a treat to see you, Lodgok. I shall let you know if I hear anything.",
  "Sirona_10401": "You be well.",
  "Sirona_10402": "Now, what can I –",
  "Sirona_10403": "Oh, there’s a face I haven’t seen before.",
  "Sirona_10404": "Welcome!",
  "Sirona_10405": "Butterbeers on me.",
  "Sirona_10406": "Heard about the attack. I shall be looking in on the other shopkeepers and residents shortly.",
  "Sirona_10407": "Glad to see you two escaped injury.",
  "Sirona_10408": "Is that right? Well done.",
  "Sirona_10409": "My pleasure.",
  "Sirona_10410": "I will say – trolls in Hogsmeade? That’s never happened before.",
  "Sirona_10411": "Something’s not right.",
  "Sirona_10412": "The only brutes we usually have to deal with are –",
  "Sirona_10413": " Hmph. How timely.",
  "Sirona_10414": "Not to worry, Victor. Once the two of you leave, the calibre of my clientele will greatly improve.",
  "Sirona_10415": "Wouldn't do that if I were you, Theophilus.",
  "Sirona_10416": "My friend is enjoying a well-earned Butterbeer.",
  "Sirona_10417": "Seems you've made an unfortunate enemy.",
  "Sirona_10418": "Watch your back. Rookwood and Harlow are worse than any troll you might encounter.",
  "Sirona_10419": "Perhaps you didn't hear me. I said my friend is busy.",

  "Sirona_10440": "Yes. Lodgok. He's a friend.",
  "Sirona_10441": "If he's not here, you might find him doing business at the Hog's Head. He's a trusted metal trader.",
  "Sirona_10442": "Hello, my friend. Did you ever find Lodgok?",
  "Sirona_10443": "Glad to hear it. I shan't ask for details of your little chat.",
  "Sirona_10445": "Those two are nothing but trouble. Glad you and your friend were here when they found you.",
  "Sirona_10446": "Not all goblins are like Ranrok and his Loyalists. Lodgok is as worried as the rest of us about what's been going on.",
  "Sirona_10447": "You should mention that we spoke. He can, understandably, be wary of witches and wizards. Even ones as young as you.",
  "Sirona_10448": "That said, if you're looking for information on Ranrok to help rein him in, you'll find an ally in Lodgok.",
  "Sirona_10451": "I assume your interest is to do with the rumours I've heard about Ranrok working with our friend Rookwood.",
  "Sirona_10452": "If you find Lodgok, please give him my best.",
  "Sirona_10453": "Not much more than the fact that they seem to have some sort of uneasy alliance.",
  "Sirona_10454": "They're bullies, plain and simple. Never tolerated them in my own life and certainly won't tolerate them going after my friends.",
  "Sirona_10455": "I've known him for years. We met when I was waiting tables here as a student – well before I bought the place.",
  "Sirona_10456": "He was cordial enough, but we weren't friends then. His mistrust of wizardkind ran deep.",
  "Sirona_10457": "We are. Hadn't seen him in years when he came in a few months ago. But, he recognised me instantly.",
  "Sirona_10459": "Which is more than I can say for some of my own classmates. Took them a second to realise I was actually a witch, not a wizard.",
  "Sirona_10463": "Friendship between wizards and goblins is rare enough. But between those two?",
  "Sirona_10464": "They each want something the other has, I can guarantee it.",
  "Sirona_10465": "That said, I fear they're like a two-headed serpent: both will need to be taken down to stop whatever scheme they've been plotting.",
  "Sirona_10466": "Don't misunderstand me. They're dangerous wizards and shouldn't be trifled with.",
  "Sirona_10467": "They should, however, be confronted and reminded – whenever possible – that the rest of us have each other's backs.",
  "Sirona_10468": "Sirona, please. And I was happy to help.",
  "Sirona_10469": "Course you can.",
  "Sirona_10470": "I don't know what you've done to make such powerful enemies. But please – watch your back.",
  "Sirona_10471": "Hello there! Nice to see you.",
  "Sirona_10472": "I wonder if you might pop in and see her. She may need some help collecting ingredients for her supply of Wiggenweld Potion.",
  "Sirona_10473": "Are you? Hmm. I suspected you and he would get along. Perhaps best I don't know details of your plans –",
  "Sirona_10474": "– and I shall refrain from telling you to be careful yet again. But I hope you will be.",
  "Sirona_10475": "And I'll refrain from telling you to be careful yet again. But I hope you will be – whatever your plans.",
  "Sirona_10476": "I do. I thought you might be just the person to do a favour for my friend, Dorothy Sprottle, in Upper Hogsfield.",
  "Sirona_10477": "And you could retrieve something of mine in the process – a box, full of old letters and such.",
  "Sirona_10480": "It's one of a few that I had when I was young. Dot found it when she was clearing out a closet.",
  "Sirona_10481": "Can't imagine what's in there. Probably terribly theatrical. The ramblings of a teenage witch and her friends.",
  "Sirona_10482": "You're welcome to take a peek inside if you do find it. To be honest, I'd imagine it contains some lovely memories.",
  "Sirona_10483": "Hello, friend. I wonder if you might stop by the Three Broomsticks when you can. I would like your help with something.",
  "Sirona_10484": "You'll find the hamlet just north of Hogsmeade. Please do give Dot my love.",
  "Sirona_10485": "Do let me know when you've had a chance to visit Dot.",
  "Sirona_10486": "Oh, thank you! I knew you were the one to ask.",
  "Sirona_10489": "Of course. It appears most of the letters were from fellow students.",
  "Sirona_10490": "Don't know what I would have done without her and Aidan. Thank you, again, for helping her.",
  "Sirona_10491": "And for returning this box of letters. It's nice to reflect on good memories.",
  "Sirona_10492": "I did. Was the Ravenclaw Seeker for three years. Merlin's beard, I adore Quidditch.",
  "Sirona_10493": "Nothing like the feeling of catching the Golden Snitch when your team's down by 140 points.",
  "Sirona_10494": "I'll never forgive Professor Black for cancelling it this year. I miss cheering for Ravenclaw. We could've cheered them on together.",
  "Sirona_10495": "I'll never forgive Professor Black for cancelling it this year. I miss cheering for Ravenclaw.",
  "Sirona_10496": "It is! Still one of my dearest friends. I know she wouldn't mind you having seen that letter. She and I are of a similar mind –",
  "Sirona_10497": "– especially when it comes to young people. We believe experience to be an invaluable teacher.",
  "Sirona_10498": "To borrow a phrase from Mirabel, it's a joy to see anyone 'blossom' – but particularly one who doubted they ever would.",
  "Sirona_10499": "We do. She taught me so much during my summers with her and Aidan.",
  "Sirona_10500": "I shall be the first to admit that adolescents aren't always the easiest to understand.",
  "Sirona_10501": "And not everyone was as kind to me as the Sprottles. But the depth of their kindness, and that of so many of my friends, got me through –",
  "Sirona_10502": "– well, got me through some challenging times, to put it mildly.",
  "Sirona_10503": "Good to let your frustrations out now and again. We've got <i>Reparo</i> if we need it.",
  "Sirona_10504": "Running a bit late this morning, were we?",
  "Sirona_10506": "I should've known Harlow had met his match the day of the troll attack in Hogsmeade. The village owes you a great debt for ridding us of that monster – and I mean Harlow.",
  "Sirona_10507": "Alfred Lawley's none too pleased. Seems he's been burgled. I shall pretend I never heard the rumours of your involvement.",

  "Sirona_10509": "Can't imagine you had much choice; bringing Pratt back here. Between you and me, if he wasn't so close with the Headmaster, I'd have left him where he was.",
  "Sirona_10510": "I'm certain Mr Pratt will learn to appreciate his new surroundings at the Hog's Head. Was thinking of doing some redecorating myself before you stepped in.",
  "Sirona_10511": "I hear poor Mr Pratt's missing frame has been destroyed. Couldn't have happened to a nicer portrait.",
  "Sirona_10512": "No need for that type of magic in the Three Broomsticks.",
  "Sirona_10515": "Come now. You've better things to do than that.",
  "Sirona_10517": "Good to see you again!",
  "Sirona_10518": "Hello, my young friend.",

  "SirPatrickDelaneyPodmore_10016": "What I'd give for a flagon of mead or a nice leg of lamb right about now. Then this party would be complete.",
  "SirPatrickDelaneyPodmore_10017": "Sir Nicholas? And a student? Who let you in?",
  "SirPatrickDelaneyPodmore_10018": "This is all very suspicious. What do you really want, as if I need to ask.",
  "SirPatrickDelaneyPodmore_10019": "Jackdaw, eh? Why, here he is now.",
  "SirPatrickDelaneyPodmore_10020": "What a shame. Without his head. I bet you've always wondered what that's like, eh, Nick?",
  "SirPatrickDelaneyPodmore_10021": "It's bound to be around here somewhere. Probably being used in a game.",
  "SirPatrickDelaneyPodmore_10023": "If you find it, I give you my permission to speak with him, my young mortal. It's the least I can do for you, for bringing this putrescent gift.",
  "SirPatrickDelaneyPodmore_10024": "Tut, tut, Sir Nicholas. How many times do I have to tell you? Our entry requirements are quite clear.",
  "SirPatrickDelaneyPodmore_10025": "Ahh, we aren't the ‘Headless except for a little bit of tendon’ Hunt, after all. Now please, follow me and I shall help you find your way out.",

  "SophroniaFranklin_10137": "If you solve them all you'll be rewarded with Herodiana Byrne's signature outfit, which I would very much like to see.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10138": "Of course. Inside a secret hall at Hogwarts, which you need to know <i>Depulso</i> to enter, is a series of puzzles.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10142": "In her later years, she taught at Hogwarts – but only for a short while. Just long enough to build a secret hall, it appears.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10143": "She's only the single greatest <i>Depulso</i> master of all time. Even taught at Hogwarts – briefly.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10144": "It's a travesty she's not more well-known.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10145": "Perhaps you didn't hear me. I said, 'the single greatest <i>Depulso</i> master of all time.'",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10146": "Whilst reading about her, I learnt that she built a secret <i>Depulso</i> training room here at Hogwarts.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10147": "But in typical, clever Herodiana fashion, one cannot access it unless one knows <i>Depulso</i>. Which, of course, third-years aren't taught.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10148": "Quick one, aren't you?",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10149": "That one may have been exaggerated, but lots of the stories about her certainly aren't.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10150": "Looking for the book 'Intermediate Transfiguration'?",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10151": "Before the invention of the Golden Snitch, which magical creature was used in a game of Quidditch?",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10152": "Correct!",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10153": "No. Incorrect. The answer was the Golden Snidget.",

  "SophroniaFranklin_10159": "The Tale of the Three Brothers involves which magical artefacts?",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10160": "Correct!",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10161": "No, the answer was the Deathly Hallows.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10162": "According to Beedle the Bard, the Deathly Hallows consist of the Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone, and the Cloak of Invisibility.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10164": "That's right!",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10165": "I'm sorry, but the correct answer was the Quaffle.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10166": "When a Chaser throws the Quaffle through one of three hoops in a Quidditch match, their team is awarded ten points.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10168": "Correct!",

  "SophroniaFranklin_10172": "I'll give you this book if you humour me by answering a few questions from my quiz.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10173": "Well, I suppose this has gone on long enough. I'll put the book back on the pedestal now.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10174": "If you're inclined to test your knowledge again, I have plenty more questions I could ask you.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10177": "Which ball in Quidditch is the largest?",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10179": "True or false: Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to change species?",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10180": "What governmental body directly preceded the Ministry of Magic?",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10181": "Did she now?",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10182": "Some people call bits of knowledge 'trivia.' I would argue that no knowledge is trivial.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10183": "Let me know if you change your mind.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10184": "Splendid! Just a few questions and then I'll hand over this book. Let us begin!",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10185": "Hence, I have created – a small quiz. Just for fun – focusing mainly on the lore of the wizarding world.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10186": "Now to get back to researching more questions for my quiz.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10187": "Back to test your knowledge?",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10189": "Emeric the Evil was killed in a duel against whom?",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10190": "That's correct!",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10191": "The Wizards' Council disbanded in 1707 after the creation of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy, which required a more structured government to support its enforcement.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10192": "Which dragon breed is the smallest?",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10193": "No, I'm sorry but the answer was the Peruvian Vipertooth.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10194": "Though the Vipertooth is the smallest breed, averaging at around fifteen feet in length, it is also the fastest breed and feared for its venomous fangs.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10195": "Who founded the village of Hogsmeade?",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10196": "That's right!",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10197": "It is believed that Hengist used the Three Broomsticks Inn as his home.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10198": "The Hidebehind was accidentally created by cross-breeding a ghoul with what other magical creature?",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10199": "Yes!",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10200": "While the Hidebehind has the power of invisibility, those who have seen it have described it as a tall, thin monkey with silver hair.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10201": "What is the only spell known to repel a Lethifold?",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10202": "Well done!",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10203": "The only known survivor of a Lethifold attack was a wizard named Flavius Belby who was on holiday In Papua New Guinea at the time.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10204": "Who published the Law of Elemental Transfiguration?",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10205": "That's it!",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10206": "One of the Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law is that food cannot be conjured. Though it can be summoned.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10207": "What does the Hogwarts motto translate to?",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10208": "Correct!",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10209": "In Latin, the Hogwarts motto is 'Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus.'",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10210": "Which magical creature is the only one known to produce eggs through its mouth?",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10211": "That's right!",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10212": "According to Parselmouths, each of the Runespoor's three heads serves a different function. The left head is the planner, the middle is the dreamer, and the right is the critic.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10213": "Where is Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry located?",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10214": "Well done!",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10215": "The American school was founded in the seventeenth century by Isolt Sayre and James Steward.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10216": "What is the most powerful love potion known to wizardkind?",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10217": "That's the answer!",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10218": "Amortentia smells differently to every person, according to what they find attractive. Such as dusty book covers or – (ahem)",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10219": "Are you interested in continuing on to the next round? They're my most difficult questions.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10220": "That's fine. Come and find me if you'd like to try later.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10221": "No that's incorrect. The answer was the Wizards' Council.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10222": "Brilliant!",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10223": "No, the answer was Hengist of Woodcroft.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10224": "That's incorrect. The answer was a Demiguise.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10225": "Actually the answer was the Patronus Charm.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10226": "That's incorrect. The answer I was looking for was Gamp.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10227": "No, the answer was 'never tickle a sleeping dragon.'",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10228": "That's incorrect. The correct answer was the Runespoor.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10229": "No, Ilvermorny is actually located on Mount Greylock.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10230": "Incorrect. The answer was Amortentia.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10231": "Wonderful! I do admire your thirst for knowledge.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10232": "Well, are you ready to test your expertise with my most difficult questions?",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10233": "That's right!",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10234": "Emeric gained notoriety for terrorising villages in the south of England during the Middle Ages when he was the master of the Elder Wand.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10235": "Incorrect. The answer was Egbert the Egregious.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10236": "If a Chaser keeps their hand on the Quaffle as it goes through the goal, what foul are they committing?",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10237": "That's right!",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10238": "Blatching is flying to intentionally collide with a player. Stooging is when two Chasers knock the other team's Keeper away from the goals so that a third Chaser can score.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10239": "The answer was actually haversacking.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10240": "A bite from a Mackled Malaclaw has the unusual side effect of causing what?",

  "SophroniaFranklin_10249": "Very good!",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10250": "Centuries later, Glover Hipworth would expand on Linfred's previous work to create the Pepperup Potion we know today.",

  "SophroniaFranklin_10276": "Thank you for humouring me by participating. I had a splendid time.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10277": "None of the other students will try it no matter how many times I ask. They all say they have enough with schoolwork.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10278": "Ugh. They don't value knowledge the way I do. Surely you're interested. I'll even start you off with a few of my easiest questions.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10279": "I put the book back on the pedestal for you.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10280": "I'm actually working on something equally interesting but need help from a fifth-year so it's good you came along.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10281": "And I won't be giving you any more easy questions either. The next ones will be more difficult.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10282": "You probably scored higher than Merlin himself would have. Impressive.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10283": "Oh! I'm glad you enjoyed it. Very helpful of you.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10284": "Good test of one's knowledge, isn't it?",

  "SophroniaFranklin_10290": "The memory of Professor Fig will live on with all of us.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10291": "I was only just discussing the troll presence in Hogsmeade. By myself, but useful for anyone listening.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10292": "In the end, Ranrok let his anger cloud his view. Perhaps his goals were noble, but not his methods.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10293": "What? How could you?",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10294": "I'll assume you know what you're doing.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10296": "Inexcusably rude!",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10297": "I'll assume you didn't see me.",
  "SophroniaFranklin_10298": "That's no way to behave in these halls.",

  "SortingHat_10020": "You come here with preferences and preconceptions – certain expectations.",

  "SortingHat_10024": "Hmm. Oh, but you're brave at heart. Exceptionally daring. Undaunted by the unknown. Willing to forge ahead alone when you must.",
  "SortingHat_10025": "Hmm. You do not give up easily, do you? You are undaunted by challenges that lie ahead. And your loyalty to a friend delayed your arrival here this evening.",
  "SortingHat_10026": "Hmm. Interesting. You've recently learned that you possess a rare ability. I detect a growing sense of ambition. An eagerness for power.",

  "SortingHat_10049": "Perhaps you belong in Hufflepuff.",
  "SortingHat_10050": "Perhaps you belong in Slytherin.",
  "SortingHat_10051": "Indeed. Hogwarts has much to offer a dedicated student. And what you learn in class will prepare you for challenges outside the classroom as well.",
  "SortingHat_10052": "Indeed. Much can be gleaned by having an adventurous spirit. But your professors have a great deal to teach you as well.",
  "SortingHat_10053": "Hmm. I wonder. Hmm. I detect something in you. A certain sense of – hmm – what is it?",
  "SortingHat_10054": "Hmm. Oh, but you're brave at heart. Exceptionally daring. Undaunted by the unknown. Willing to forge ahead alone when you must.",
  "SortingHat_10055": "Hmm. You're clever, indeed. You have the ability to reflect clearly on that which puzzles others. And you've a ready mind. Quick to learn.",

  "T3DarkWizardFemale1_10004": "No – what?",
  "T3DarkWizardFemale1_10005": "Spit it out. What? Is it about my hair? My attire? My complexion perhaps?",

  "T3DarkWizardFemale1_10012": "Did you bring any back?",

  "T3DarkWizardFemale1_10014": "Which is exactly my point. All I suggested was we start later. You're having us start too early.",
  "T3DarkWizardFemale1_10015": "No good reason? You're putting us at risk having us start so early. It's a wonder the cockerel hasn't given us up.",
  "T3DarkWizardFemale1_10016": "I don't trust you.",
  "T3DarkWizardFemale1_10017": "I said it. I don't trust you. Never have.",

  "T3DarkWizardFemale2_10006": "Oh, Merlin's. I think we've a lost cause here.",
  "T3DarkWizardFemale2_10007": "No, no. What you want to do is look at the eyes. The eyes tell all.",
  "T3DarkWizardFemale2_10008": "Now you're seeing some sense. If they squint, they likely have more to offer.",
  "T3DarkWizardFemale2_10009": "Yes, now you're getting it.",
  "T3DarkWizardFemale2_10010": "What?",
  "T3DarkWizardFemale2_10011": "What? Don't be silly. I'm talking about the look they get in their eyes, when they're hiding something.",
  "T3DarkWizardFemale2_10012": "You're holding up your wares, asking a price; a hefty price. But their eyes may say they can afford more.",
  "T3DarkWizardFemale2_10013": "What? What are you talking about?",
  "T3DarkWizardFemale2_10014": "Oh, give me strength. I tell you what, you just carry me bags.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale1_10001": "There is though. Far more selection for witches. Always been that way. Don't know why.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale1_10002": "All I'm saying is, when's the last time you had a good choice for boots? Eh?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale1_10003": "Witches are spoiled for choice. Little heels, big heels – flounces.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale1_10004": "What?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale1_10005": "Well. Flounces. I'd like a boot with some height to the heel. Something to support my carriage.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale1_10006": "Oh, there could be some truth to that. I've seen quite a few plump wizards of late. Portly.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale1_10007": "Anyone hungry? All this talk's making me rabid for a fisherman's pie.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale1_10008": "Not as if we'll have anything worth stealing.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale1_10009": "Ooh, you're not, are you?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale1_10010": "I should think so.  Well. ",
  "T3DarkWizardMale1_10011": "Now that we have that out of the way, I don't suppose you have any Puffskein food on you, do you?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale1_10012": "Only Henry seems to be ravenous lately.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale2_10000": "Honourable path. But, aren't we – criminals?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale2_10001": "Of course. My apologies.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale2_10002": "Ah, I see. Well, I certainly perceive you as strong and mighty. Terrifying.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale2_10003": "Of course. My apologies.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale2_10004": "Powerful.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale2_10005": "Present well. Yes, I can see that.  How do you mean, 'present well'?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale2_10006": "Commanding.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale2_10007": "Yes. I understand now. My apologies.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale2_10008": "Oh dear, er, I'm very sorry.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale2_10009": "Tell all. The eyes tell all.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale2_10010": "I shall keep a keen eye for them to squint.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale2_10011": "Ah. Could just be a sunny day.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale2_10012": "Would it be safer to only offer your wares at night?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale2_10013": "In the dark. So there's no mistaking of the squint.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale3_10000": "Oh, I'm not sure that's true. I've often found the odd gem in Gladrags. One simply has to look carefully.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale3_10001": "Oh, come now. That's not true at all. I've been in there days where all you see are young wizards rummaging through robes.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale3_10002": "Very well; let's say, there was more selection at Gladrags; what is it you'd be wanting to buy exactly?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale3_10003": "What is the choice you're seeking – this elusive garment you feel would be so advantageous to you?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale3_10004": "If you wouldn't attack your fisherman's pie with such vengeance perhaps you wouldn't need such support.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale3_10005": "What? What on earth are you talking about?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale3_10006": "Plump?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale3_10007": "That's a bit unnecessary, don't you think?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale3_10008": "Yes, no need to take things to such depths.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale3_10009": "And as I was saying, it seems rather mercenary to leave someone without so much as a Knut in their pocket.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale3_10010": "I beg your pardon?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale3_10011": "This is absurd, and I do not appreciate the affront to my character. I'm as foul a criminal as any of you.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale4_10000": "Fairly. I'll take that. I mean, could've said much worse, couldn't you?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale4_10001": "Well, yes. That and the episode with the Shrivelfig.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale4_10002": "Oh yes. I'm afraid so.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale4_10003": "Mediocre. I'll take that. I mean, very good of you, all things considered. Especially with the leech juice.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale4_10004": "Aye. Very unfortunate, that.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale4_10005": "Rethink, sir?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale4_10006": "Incompetent. I'll take that. I mean, could've said much worse, couldn't you. Especially after the Mandrakes.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale4_10007": "I'm grateful for the opportunity to work with you, sir. I trust you're finding my efforts satisfactory?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale4_10008": "Oh. Me? Oh, er, I don't know why that would be?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale4_10009": "Respectable.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale4_10010": "No. No - no, of course not. Only, oh never mind.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale4_10011": "No, really, it's nothing. I shouldn't have said –",
  "T3DarkWizardMale4_10012": "Oh. No. It's, well – I think you may have stepped in Mooncalf dung.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale4_10013": "Tell me then. Don't keep me hanging.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale4_10014": "Oh. I see.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale4_10015": "Y – yes?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale4_10016": "And? What if I have?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale4_10017": "It's my sister!",
  "T3DarkWizardMale4_10018": "If you're implying that my sister's husband is poisoning me, I think you've been downing too much Alihotsy.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale4_10019": "And perhaps I'm looking peaky because I'm tired of listening to your nonsensical accusations.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale4_10020": "'Anyway' what?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale4_10021": "I'd never seen anything like it. It was as though you had the power of ten Erumpents in your wand.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale4_10022": "Hazel wand, you have?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale4_10023": "Oh yes, of course. Have you ever been injured in a duel?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale4_10024": "Swindon? Something happened in Swindon, did it? Something where you had to show your true bravery.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale4_10025": "Oh, taller. More intimidating, aren't you? When you're taller.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale4_10026": "Sounds like the love of your life. And you let her get away?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale4_10027": "Well, you're a bit of a moonmind then, aren't you?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale4_10028": "Oh! Trip Jinx, I bet. Scoundrels.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale5_10000": "I tell you why one has to look carefully; because Augustus Hill caters to witches. Says they spend more.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale5_10001": "My point exactly. It's about time wizarding style caught up to wizards.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale5_10002": "That's another thing. Encourage you to eat, they do; all these clothing traders.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale5_10003": "They want you plump.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale5_10004": "Yes. So your old clothes don't fit and you have to buy new ones.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale5_10005": "Take it all, I say.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale5_10006": "I most certainly do not. If they've got it, they can afford to lose it.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale5_10007": "Oh! Well!  You're an inspiration, aren't you.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale5_10008": "As I was saying, if you're walking these parts with Galleons in your pocket, well, it's your own fault.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale5_10009": "I am getting a little weary of your mightier than thou approach to our business. Are you a criminal or not?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale5_10010": "I said it. Are you with us, or are you secretly fancying yourself a desk at the Ministry of Magic?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale6_10000": "I don't know how he could say witches spend more. I spend a small fortune in that shop.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale6_10001": "Portly? Nothing wrong with portly. Makes for a good presence. Strong.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale7_10000": "Yes, I suppose I'd rank you fairly, since you're asking.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale7_10001": "I assume you're referring to the unfortunate incident with the Jobberknoll feathers?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale7_10002": "That was you? Oh I didn't know that.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale7_10003": "That caused me a dreadful row with my wife. Mm, I think I'll have to revise your ranking to mediocre.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale7_10004": "What? That was you as well?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale7_10005": "Unfortunate? I was almost poisoned! Oh no, no, no. That's not good at all. No. I'm afraid I need to rethink this.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale7_10006": "Yes, rethink. I'm afraid mediocre is no longer suitable. No, I'm afraid I'm going to have to deem you incompetent.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale7_10007": "(sigh) Give me strength.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale7_10008": "(scoff) Was nothing really. That's what you have to do when you have an ogre eager to flatten your pride.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale7_10009": "Oh, goodness no. Vine wood. Unicorn hair. Nothing like unicorn hair for reliability.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale7_10010": "Me? Injured? No. Can't say I have. Oh, I suppose there was that time in Swindon.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale7_10011": "I fell over if that's what you mean.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale7_10013": "No, no. Broke a heel. Was a period of time where I wanted to be taller.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale7_10014": "(scoff) I simply had a lady friend I'd wanted to impress. Gargantuan woman by the name of Hypaxia Doorwerth.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale7_10015": "Lovely girl. Should have asked her for her hand when I had the chance. Never met anyone like her since.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale7_10016": "Indeed I did.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale7_10017": "I don't think I need to hear any more of it is all I'm saying.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale7_10018": "That's utter nonsense. Completely false. I've heard every word you've said. I simply choose to disagree.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale7_10019": "You're criticising the way I'm organising our endeavours. And for no good reason.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale7_10020": "Now you're being absurd. We've always started when folks are bleary-eyed from the ale. And they start early these days.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale7_10021": "Besides, why are you all of a sudden fussing over when we start? Never heard you moan about it before?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale7_10022": "Beg your pardon?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale7_10023": "Well. Now that we've got that out the way – I reckon we're in for a bit of rain tomorrow.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale8_10000": "As long as you walk the honourable path, so shall you be seen.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale8_10001": "Yes, renegades is far more suitable. 'Criminals' makes us sound common.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale8_10002": "What our esteemed colleague is trying to say is that one must present well.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale8_10003": "We must carry about us the charisma and mannerisms of those who would be presumed powerful.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale8_10004": "Bold. Fearless.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale8_10005": "Apologies for what? Why do you keep saying that?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale8_10006": " Merlin help us all. What is wrong with wizards today?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale8_10007": " This one's not cut out to be a leader, I can tell you that much.",
  "T3DarkWizardMale8_10008": "What constitutes a squint?",
  "T3DarkWizardMale8_10009": "A squint. What defines a squint exactly? Could just be a sunny day.",
  "T3GhostFemale2_10000": "Oh, ahem -",
  "T3GhostMale1_10000": "Shan't hold my breath for that.",
  "T3GhostMale1_10001": "You said that forty years ago.",
  "T3GhostMale1_10002": "My dear mound of shoulders, I'm afraid it was I that drew her gaze.",
  "T3GhostMale1_10003": "Oh for heaven's sake get on with it.",
  "T3GhostMale1_10004": "(cough) Forgetting anything?",
  "T3GhostMale1_10005": "Thought you'd never ask.",
  "T3GhostMale3_10000": "You should. You should ask her.",
  "T3GhostMale3_10001": "You should. Before the next century.",
  "T3GhostMale3_10002": "Care to dance?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10000": "She always gives you higher marks than me.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10001": "Everyone knows you're Garlick's favourite.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10002": "Oh, that's so unfair. It was obviously as old as Merlin, and I bet she knew it.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10003": "Yes, and I believe Garlick wasn't fully impressed that all of your 'knowledge' was potty.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10004": "You merrily recanted that Devil's Snare is dangerous on account of its propensity to stab people.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10005": "Well, everyone knows that dangers residing amidst Devil's Snare involve strangulation.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10006": "Of course. We have to do something to keep you in her good graces; seeing as I'm her favourite and all.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10007": "I almost had a treasure once – from my grandmother.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10008": "An enchanted hourglass. It would flow quicker if you were in a boring class – so the teacher would think it was later.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10009": "You could be done a class in half the time. Would've been brilliant for Potions.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10010": "Oh, I thought about it. I looked into us getting one but apparently they can eat your leg off. So it wasn't ideal.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10011": "Oh. My grandmother changed her mind. I probably shouldn't've mentioned about using it in Potions.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10012": "(giggling)",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10013": "– then in the end it didn't shrink.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10014": "The purse. I thought it was Moke skin – but I'd obviously been taken in by the vendor.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10015": "Yes, all right, clever clogs. I knew I shouldn't have told you.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10016": "And? – were they not?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10017": "I don't feel so bad, then. That does sound rather – untoward.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10018": "Obviously, it's me.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10019": "Because I've never been to the house of a Muggle let alone eaten at one of their establishments.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10020": "What if I was? It's the same food we eat, bar a few exceptions?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10021": "What do you mean, watching? What sort of person spies on someone eating?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10022": "What do you mean Muggle pudding? It's the same trifle we eat when you go to your uncle's house in Chigwell.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10023": "That's completely untrue! But if you ever tell a soul that I was at a Muggle establishment I shall – hex you!",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10025": "What? What is your foul mind conjuring up now?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10026": "You're despicable.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10027": "You putrid, wretched excuse for a wizard.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10028": "I hope you get lured away by an Erkling, and eaten by a Lethifold and then – stomped by an Erumpent.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10029": "You're likely right that they have an advantage.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10030": "That's assuming your sister was a good player.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10031": "Well. I mean, it only works if your sister was good at the sport. No good if your sister was hopeless at Quidditch.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10032": "In fact, it could be a detriment to have a sister who, let's say, had bad habits in the game.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10033": "Yes. What if your sister had practised on the moors, without the need for accuracy? She'd be abysmal in a match.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10034": "That's what I'm saying. Count yourself lucky you've no skill on the pitch. At least you haven't learned a bad habit.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10035": "It's the grip on the broom though, isn't it? Without a firm grip you're lost.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10036": "You've got a Yew Weaver?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10037": "Neglect?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10038": "How's that?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10039": "Oh. Gosh. I wish I was neglected.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10040": "No. My parents – quite dote on me. ",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10041": "Oh. Yes, thank you.  I just really wish I was neglected.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10042": "I suppose you're right. Scoring fifteen goals should certainly warrant a win in my book.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10043": "What would you have it be, then? If it wasn't ten points for a goal and a hundred and fifty for the Snitch.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10044": "Eleven. Eleven points for a goal.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10045": "Fifty. Fifty for a goal.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10046": "I see. You get three goals, and the other team catches the Snitch, and then you're even.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10047": "It – actually does seem fair to me. It is the nature of sport, isn't it? There has to be a winner – and a loser.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10048": "Anyway, I thought you'd never played Quidditch.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10049": "I remember you saying you had an inverted kneecap and could never get on the broom right?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10050": "I've seen you running up to the Astronomy Tower though. You're even first there sometimes.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10051": "You don't know a lot about Quidditch do you.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10052": "Don't be absurd. If it were any less funny it would be an Acromantula carcass.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10053": "It's a revolting trick.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10054": "That's an awful thought and I'm not sure I can ever forgive you for it.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10055": "Absolutely. If you slipped so much as a stale bun in the vicinity of the Headmaster you'd lose your head.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10056": "Because he was overly confident. The mere mention of Zonko's and he acts like a wild thing with his tales.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10057": "I agree. But that's third-years for you. More confident than when they started, but still trying to prove themselves.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10058": "I wouldn't have. I'd wager a six-inch essay on goblin rebellions that that boy's never spent a Knut at Zonko's.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10059": "That and he's terrified of getting detention. Told me straight to my face.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10060": "Been in detention for sneezing too loudly in the library. You'd have thought he'd been had by Dementors.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10061": "I didn't realise it was the exploding type.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10062": "I thought perhaps she'd picked some up from Steepley's. They have bonbons sometimes.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10063": "Funny? I should think a Jarvey would've had more composure. I thought my entire mouth was going to explode.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10064": "I'm sure I'd have found it funny if I was watching someone else nearly choke to death on an Exploding Bonbon.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10065": "I'd say more of a popping. With a bit of burning. Although that could've been the humiliation.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10066": "I should think I did look flushed. Perhaps she'll get some for you next time and we'll see how you fare.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10067": "I hurled them as far as I could.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10068": "What? First-years?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10069": "Yes. I suspect she has a new least favourite scent now. The rest was first-years.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10070": "Yes. And I got the girl who says the smell of Flobberworm Mucus is her 'least favourite scent'.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10071": "I don't think they'd been hit by Dungbombs before. They'd certainly never played Quidditch.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10072": "They ran straight off to Kogawa asking why Bludgers smelt so bad.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10073": "Obviously that's when everything changed.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10074": "I'd hardly say that the 'point' of history. It's not as if history's something one can avoid, is it?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10075": "But – when you look back at, say, something like the Statute, one could argue that 1692 was especially unique.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10076": "Oh, was that from the Three Broomsticks? I don't think she makes those for just anyone, you were lucky.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10077": "But back to my point.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10078": "Every day isn't the same as every other day. And the things that impact us the most are what forge our history.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10079": "Well – yes.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10080": "They call it chemistry.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10081": "I wonder how similar it is to Potions?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10082": "Oh, you've had a potion go horribly wrong, have you?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10083": "I see. Only you said – so I thought you might've.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10084": "Oh? And what happened?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10085": "Hallucinating?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10086": "And you consider this – nothing drastic?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10087": "I see. So you didn't get hurt at all?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10088": "Oh I remember that day. Yes. In Greenhouse Three.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10089": "Yes, I do recall now. And Professor Garlick knocked it over and we ran out.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10090": "Well I did say to distract her by asking how to handle Flesh-Eating Slugs.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10091": "Ah yes. Yes I do. The toadstools had more than proven their name and were hopping into the Mandrake pots.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10092": "You after making a Befuddlement Draught?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10093": "Well it's not you.  Oh, I see what you're saying. Yes, that's rotten to enchant your quill. How foul.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale1_10094": "Fair enough. I'll trade you sneezewort and scurvy-grass in exchange for letting bygones be bygones. Friends?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10000": "What's to say one family's more important than another? I mean, surely it's who has the most money?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10001": "Mm. I suppose you're right.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10002": "Except –",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10003": "Is there anything your father didn't nearly die of?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10004": "Nine lives.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10005": "I think Howin should be allowed to bring any beast she wants into class.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10006": "What? What would be the issue with a unicorn?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10007": "Oh! – Nifflers!",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10008": "Don't mind him, he's just scared of anything that has more than two legs.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10009": "What?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10010": "Since when do you know what goes on at Muggle schools?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10011": "Yes, you could've warned us there. Not sure I'll have a pleasant day, what with thinking about a 'dead canary'.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10012": "Oh yes, I've heard that too. Apparently, it started in the 1600s.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10013": "It was only <i>Accio</i>. I don't see what the fuss is about.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10014": "I'd only dropped my hat and I'm certain no one saw me. It's just it was blowing away and it's my favourite.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10015": "I know! And it was made by my grandmother. She enchanted it to keep my hair tidy.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10016": "I thought it was funny. You shouldn't be so serious all the time.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10017": "Oh, how horrible. Shouldn't you tell Weasley?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10018": "(giggling)",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10019": "I find the prices quite reasonable in Hogsmeade.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10020": "What's that supposed to mean?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10021": "Don't be silly, there's nothing to be gained from coming from money.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10022": "Oh, it is. It's incredibly difficult to keep it tidy.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10023": "Oh, stop. Tell you what, next time we go to Hogsmeade, I'll treat you to a Butterbeer.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10024": "Yes, of course.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10025": "Fine. Next time we're at the Three Broomsticks, remind me. Now enough of this, you're all making me feel very self-conscious.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10026": "Wasn't that first-year keeping one under her bed?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10027": "I don't see what the harm would be myself. As long as you promised not to break into anyone's trunk.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10028": "I like Thomas Brown. He always takes the time to show me where all the new books are.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10029": "Don't leave me out. I'm always up for a visit to that shop. He's a clever man, that Thomas Brown.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10030": "Oh, romance in the air.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10031": "Er – no, I suppose not, come to think of it. My parents are quite generous now that you mention.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10032": "What does tilling a field involve exactly?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10033": "I'll have you know I do very well in Herbology. Some even think I'm Garlick's favourite.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10034": "That was an accident and I blame Professor Garlick for not reminding me that the watering can was full.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10035": "I almost fell asleep the last time you started talking about what Binns had been teaching.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10036": "Don't worry, I shan't be borrowing that again. I think I lost a week of my life trying to get through chapter one.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10037": "What?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10038": "Thank you!",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10039": "Fine. I shall keep my techniques to myself since you find them so –",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10040": "Oh, you absolute scoundrel. Insult me, then ask for my help. Not a chance.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10041": "Lucky to have him alive, you mean?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10042": "Some of us enjoyed Quidditch.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10043": "I got one for simply saying hello. He called it 'an unwarranted approach'. He definitely hates me.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10044": "However, if his mission's to be the least popular headmaster Hogwarts ever had, then I'd say he's well on his way.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10045": "Prewett and Parkinson. That's what she said.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10046": "Why would she lie? They're her grandparents. I'm sure if she says they're both pure-bloods – ?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10047": "Because she's telling us. And they're her grandparents.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10048": "What? What point? How is randomly accusing someone of lying 'a point'?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10049": "Wait, now you're both getting carried away. Now you're the ones making up stories.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10050": "What does that have to do with anything?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10051": "What? Making what up?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10052": "He didn't agree.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10053": "Well. I think we can all agree that no one would make that up.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10054": "That's preposterous!",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10055": "Who in their right mind would brag that their grandfather's good with a septic tank?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10056": "Oh, for Merlin's sake.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10057": "Oh, I'm sure you're exaggerating.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10058": "I – find that thought rather unlikely since, well, things were more uncivilised back then. Superstition ran amok.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10059": "What? Cricket?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10060": "How cruel.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10061": "Oh! Oh I see.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10062": "Oh. Yes. Didn't mean to be rude. I'm very sorry.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10063": "Ugh. That is a horrible idea.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10064": "My friend told me they have different tongues.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10065": "W – what do you think it would be like then? Like – a snake?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10066": "Of a Muggle tongue? Looking like – a snake?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10067": "Yes. Tell us where you heard this 'fact'.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10068": "See like – a snake?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10069": "If Black doesn't reverse his decision, I'm afraid you'll never have the chance for revenge.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10070": "I like her, Astoria. Never had cross words with her, and she once helped me catch a Bowtruckle.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10071": "I'm fairly sure that charming the Quaffle is against the rules. That would definitely be considered a foul.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10072": "She simply says I'll grow into them.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10073": "I wish they'd lock him in the greenhouse with the Mandrakes.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10074": "They might be marvellous at it.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10075": "In all fairness, Muggles do make teas that can help one fall asleep more easily. They do use herbs too.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10076": "Well. I suppose we'll never know, will we?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10077": "I know.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10078": "I didn't mean for you to get wound up.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10079": "I take it you won't be coming with us for cherry trifle at my auntie's house.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10080": "The man's more obsessed with blood purity than the well-being of his students.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10081": "I overheard him talking with Kogawa the other day. She was pleading with him to bring Quidditch back.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10082": "You should've heard her. Promised to have impeccable safety regulations in place; Nurse Blainey on hand.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10083": "But would the man listen? No. All he kept on about was his reputation and how injured adolescents were a blight.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10084": "It's a wonder they don't do away with Slytherin altogether, the man's such an embarrassment to the house.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10085": "Oh. Well. I didn't mean you. I'm sure another house would take you in anyway.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10086": "Has Black even ever taught a class in his whole entire life?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10087": "Still. At least we have Garlick. She's lovely. A Professor Black antidote.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10088": "(sneaky giggling)",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10089": "Never hurts if it's in your family though.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10090": "Sporting prowess. I think some people are simply born with it.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10091": "Lucky though, aren't they?",

  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10093": "Practice is good though, isn't it?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10094": "It's a wonder you didn't collide with the ground.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10095": "We're doing it for your own good.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10096": "Not a bad idea that.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10097": "Yes tricky one that. There is that second-year. The Seeker who likes to hum a lot.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10098": "He sold me a second-rate one. I know it.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10099": "I think it was used.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10100": "Yes. I've a good mind to tell Madam Kogawa so that she doesn't recommend him anymore.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10101": "Dust. As soon as I had it outside in the light I could see it. Dust. All over.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10102": "But I paid full price. I feel Mr Weekes should take into consideration the dust and amend his sales price accordingly.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10103": "What?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10104": "Oh. You think I should ask? Tell him about the dust.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10105": "Mm, yes. I see your point. I need to tell him about the dust.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10106": "I suppose I could simply forget about it. It has been in the rain after all.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10107": "It did really.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10108": "No. I can't say it does. No.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10109": "Fair I suppose.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10110": "Yes, it's a good one that.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10111": "What about merely improving what skill you have; becoming better, without the purpose being to win or to lose?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10112": "I should think they'd be the same wouldn't they?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10113": "Wouldn't that make their legs stronger? From all the walking?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10114": "Oh. I see. Mm, makes sense then.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10115": "Where do they walk to?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10116": "Muggles. When they're walking. Where do they walk to?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10117": "Suppose they wouldn't be walking to a broom shop, would they?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale2_10118": "Oh, I am. Although I must say, I do like to walk.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale3_10000": "Ugh, and you’re both wrong anyway. It was Hesphaestus Gore.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale3_10001": "Stop it, Peeves! You’ll get us in trouble!",
  "T3StudentGryffindorFemale3_10002": "Peeves! Enough! You’ll get us all detention!",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10000": "Nobody likes a boring person.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10001": "My point is simply – I'm not sure that honour and bravery are even fashionable anymore.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10002": "Seems to me if you're in detention every day you're more likely to catch a wandering eye, if you know what I mean.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10003": "Ah! So the fact that he doesn't get detention – in your eyes – makes him more appealing!",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10004": "I'd go there any time. I don't see why people fuss so much about the forest.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10005": "What?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10006": "And what's a little danger ever done? –except drawn out the fire.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10007": "Has anyone ever told you – you're the perfect Ravenclaw.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10008": "It's the best feeling in the world.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10009": "That's one way to look at it, I suppose.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10010": "Sounds like you should've gone to a Muggle school instead.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10011": "Your face.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10012": "And nor am I. I can do without getting expelled just at the moment.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10013": "I can see we're going to have to be firm here. No. It's a no. And stop being such a bad influence.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10014": "Perhaps he'll sit next to you one day.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10015": "Especially if their name's Everett Clopton. I could tell him, you know?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10016": "That a Ravenclaw girl's sweet on him. Perfect, really. Keeping it in the same house and all.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10017": "Touched a nerve, I see. I'll have to let Everett know how much passion you have.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10018": "Who doesn't like heroics?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10019": "You're just jealous because you wouldn't come within a mile of a Horntail if the Triwizard Cup was in it for you.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10020": "And let me guess – you enjoy talking about – Astronomy?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10021": "Swoon?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10022": "I can't say I'm much interested, I'm afraid.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10023": "What sort of tasty potions? You mean, like – recipes?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10024": "Ugh! If there are, I'm definitely not going.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10025": "There's likely a reason it's called the restricted section. Probably there are potions that could be quite dangerous.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10026": "Yes, but in all fairness I did almost get flattened by a Streeler.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10027": "I can't believe the two of you. Who would make up such a thing?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10028": "I'm not making it up. If I wanted you to think I was brave, I'd – swap Black's beard balm for Flobberworm Mucus.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10029": "You two are moonminds. Literally moonminds.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10030": "I wouldn't be so foolish as to get caught flying away from school grounds.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10031": "Oh, well in that case, it was definitely me.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10032": "I most certainly do not. I was joking, clearly.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10033": "What? And why is that exactly?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10034": "You little pair of capeflappers.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10035": "I honestly don't mind, if you thought it would help?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10036": "Yes, she can sound quite stern sometimes, but she's actually got a good heart – when it comes to flying.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10037": "What's that?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10057": "Do their best though, don't they.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10058": "But that's what I mean, though; they do their best.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10059": "What choice do they have? Must be awful. Torn between two worlds.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10060": "I'm sure you wouldn't like it if everyone simply referred to you as 'that half-blood'.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10061": "What?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10062": "I heard my grandmother speak about it. She swore there was another.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10063": "Yes but there was another.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10064": "I'm being serious. It wasn't Scarecrow anyway.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10065": "Barnsandwich.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10066": "I'm serious.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10067": "You pair are hopeless.  Wish I'd never even said anything.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10068": "Oh, do please be quiet. Pair of you sound like you've been at the Alihotsy. ",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10069": "And a – a phoenix.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10070": "Understood. I just thought it was amusing when you said she had a Hippogriff under her bed.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10071": "Understood.  Well? Are you going to show us, then?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10072": "Yes, why not?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10073": "Oh, how exciting!",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10076": "No need to get upset about it. I'm not saying you wished you were Muggle-born.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10077": "I'm allowed to have my own personal opinion, and if I think Muggle-born wizards have more fun, I can say it.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10078": "Not much difference? Not much difference?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10079": "Well, obviously the first thing is, their parents don't do magic. What about that?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10080": "Imagine growing up and not having to be afraid of being turned into a Murtlap?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10081": "Well, mine didn't either. I'm simply using that as an example.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10082": "Never mind. Knew I shouldn't have brought it up. . I bet Muggles don't have to have discussions like this.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10083": "Any wizard can take you on a carriage ride through London; what are you on about?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10084": "Am I hearing this right? You're saying, you're both saying, that you'd take the hand of a Muggle?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10085": "But, what could a Muggle possibly offer that a wizard can't? It's absurd. Potty. Ludicrous.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10086": "Sounds to me as if you're more enthralled with the idea of someone toiling for you than marrying a Muggle?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10087": "My, pfft, hurt my feelings? Pfft, you're not hurting my feelings! Ha! Pfft! Now that's a funny thought.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10088": "B – but, I simply meant, ugh, what's the point. Don't lose your wand.  And enjoy your wilted flowers.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10089": "See what?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10090": "Take for example medicine. Muggles are tremendously creative in their efforts. Even use leeches.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10091": "No. They let them suck their blood.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10092": "It's true. Leeches are mostly carnivorous you see. Typically prey on small invertebrates.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10093": "There's really nothing to be afraid of. It's quite ingenious.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10094": "Ah, that is entirely possible. They do secrete an anticoagulant.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10095": "Anticoagulant. It thins your blood so they can drink it more easily.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10096": "They don’t eat you they exsanguinate you.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10097": "Oh please. Please let us hear your Parseltongue, I've always wanted to know what it's like.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10098": "Oh, I thought it was marvellous. Gosh, I do hope we don't get set upon by snakes.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10099": "Oh!  Perhaps she does have a phoenix under her bed after all!",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10100": "I saw a first-year with one the other day.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10101": "No, of course not. But they'll have scales on them if Black finds out.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10102": "With a broomstick? Besides, first-years are strictly forbidden from even having their own brooms in school!",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10103": "Yes, Mrs Clopton.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10104": "What kind of what?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10105": "Oh, of course. It was a Wind Wisp. New by the looks of it. I saw them at Spintwitches last time I was there.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10106": "Hmph. Must be nice to have a Wind Wisp. Mind you, the Yew Weaver's hard to beat. Like a whippet that one.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10107": "Clopton'll be lucky to have you as a wife. He can pinch all the knickknacks he wants and you'll think he's innocent.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10108": "I'm not taking my chances with unauthorised games. I've had enough  encounters with Skele-Gro, thank you.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10109": "I'm not scared of bewitched big toes. My injuries were serious, not for idle banter over cups of tea.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10110": "Well I will. I'm not hiding them. They're horrific. Too much for some to listen to.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10111": "A buzzing extremity is nothing to joke about.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10112": "No. No, it was only my elbow. It was very painful. Very painful.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10113": "Being on the forefront of danger isn't about the most 'entertaining' suffering. I didn't get wounded for laughs.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10114": "Bland? You two are ruthless. What is it you'd see happen to me – that would satisfy your need for amusement?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10115": "Ooh, now that would be gripping. Oh yes. A bit of death, now we're talking.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10116": "This friendship has expired. No more Christmas cards for Hufflepuff. Ravenclaw: you were never on the list.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10117": "Yes. I don't see the issue?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10118": "I don't understand. Who wouldn't be enthralled by that? There's no better feeling in the world.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10119": "Unnerving? Surely it invigorates you! Fires you up to prove yourself!",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10120": "You really should call it a Snitch.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10121": "Mm. Perhaps you should be one of them, then?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10122": "A banshee. You be the one screaming along with the crowd. After all, they're just as important as the players.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10123": "Well. Now that that's sorted. Shall we talk about who we think'll be picked for next year's Captain?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10124": "Your broom looks like it's done the rounds of every chimney in Hogsmeade.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10125": "What an abysmal sister.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10126": "But she'd already told him she'd buy him a new broom. That's an agreement. You can't go back on it for a whim.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10127": "Perhaps abysmal people don't have them.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10128": "Why would his sister's Patronus be a big fierce bear? You've never even met her, why would you possibly think that?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10129": "What?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10130": "Well. If she can muster the power to conjure a Patronus, I reckon the least she can do is repair your broom.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10131": "Scoundrel! My broom's in perfectly good shape.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10132": "It was 1473. I don't think a Sunday passed that my father didn't remind me.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10133": "Mm, I suppose so. What astounds me is that there was anyone left alive in that match.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10134": "Yes. How could any team withstand seven hundred fouls when some of them are outright deadly?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10135": "You're planning on working at the Ministry then?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10136": "Oh. Very good. You'll remember us all then, will you?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10137": "When we all get reported for breaking six hundred and ninety-nine Quidditch rules.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10138": "I for one was looking forward to winning the Cup this year.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10139": "How very encouraging of you.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10140": "Perhaps it's best Black cancelled it. I think I should be so distraught to play and then not win the thing.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10141": "It's the truth. I'd be happy if we had practice twice a day. And who was injured anyway? Not our fault.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10142": "Gryffindor was well set to take on Slytherin, I can tell you that much. Slaughtered them, we would've.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10143": "Ugh. Now you've really ruined my day bringing up History of Magic. Just thinking of Binns makes me need a lie down.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10144": "It's an absurd excuse though, isn't it?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10145": "Well I want to know how nasty.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10146": "Well, for one, it'd make me feel better if I knew it was particularly gruesome.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10147": "Exactly. Because if it's anything less than them being severed in half then it's absolutely not warranted.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10148": "No. There's Skele-Gro for that.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10149": "What? What was it? You might as well tell us now.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10150": "You're right. It wasn't a good idea.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10151": "He has an Order named after him. I should think that would be enough.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10152": "Oh, of course. I was just saying that I do think Merlin is the pinnacle of what it means to be a legend.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10153": "Yes. I could say I'm never eating Chocolate Frogs again, possibly the biggest decision of my lifetime.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10154": "Wouldn't make me a legend.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10155": "Huge.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10156": "Young for a shopkeeper though, isn't he?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10157": "At least old enough to be my father, I'd think.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10158": "What?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10159": "Oh. Yes. My mother's five years older than my father so that's even better.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10160": "It's about experience isn't it? How can Albie Weekes possibly know all that there is to know about brooms?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10161": "You never agree with me.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10162": "Obviously.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10163": "Everyone knows it.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10164": "Please could you recount the ways in which one becomes infamous.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10165": "Precisely.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10166": "Well, you have to do something really special don't you?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10167": "I swear she noticed.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10168": "We're lucky Black doesn't teach Herbology.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10169": "Has Black ever actually taught anything?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10170": "The man's so vain it's a wonder every portrait in the school hasn't been taken down and replaced with one of him.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10171": "Incredible. That someone could be appointed Headmaster without having ever taught a class.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10172": "Goodness, anyone'd think you'd hired the man yourself.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10173": "I reckon you only like her because she waves a blind eye to your Sugar Quills.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10174": "What? Ugh, I thought you had better taste than that. Besides, I thought you were sweet on Clopton?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10175": "What happened with Adelaide anyway?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10176": "I should be the one to do it.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10177": "You were all for it last week.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10178": "Oh I saw that, yes. Cricket wasn't even nearby. I think Howin was just after giving someone an earful.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10179": "Then let's make it Shah. I'm only talking about a little Trip Jinx. It's not as if I'm looking to transfigure someone.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10180": "You're a one to talk. Wasn't it you that did it last time?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10181": "Well, will you at least be our watch?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10182": "My grandmother did.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10183": "It's the best thing I've ever seen in my life. My grandfather was livid.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10184": "Yes, you know what they say about people who don't have a sense of humour.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10185": "I haven't heard that one either but if it helps get you on board with Nose-Biting Teacups I'm all for it.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10186": "No, she died. But her portrait's fantastic.  It's the most fun you can have without getting expelled.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10187": "Oh, she'd enjoy a visit from you at the house. Been years since she's seen someone bitten by one of those cups.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10188": "What did you get her? For her birthday?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10189": "I am not.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10190": "Couldn't have done better myself.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10191": "I made it up.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10192": "It was an experiment.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10193": "I thought if I said I'd put Frog Spawn Soap in the pea soup, well – that I'd become more popular.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10194": "What if I put Stink Pellets outside the Slytherin common room?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10195": "I'm celebrating today.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10196": "No. I didn't. As a matter of fact, I received quite good marks on my Charms test.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10197": "All but one. And Ronen told me that everyone put the wrong answer for that one.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10198": "I think I did.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10199": "Which is the one you're good at then?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10200": "I might possibly be inclined. What's in it for me?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10201": "Hm. Leech Juice. I'm not entirely enthused.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10202": "What about – you eat an Acid Pop?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10203": "Very well. I shall continue to practise the Summoning Charm on my own.  <i>Accio</i>.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10204": "It's just that I've been getting on quite well of late, so the thought of upsetting Scribner, well, it seems – foolish.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10205": "Tormenting first-years isn't fun anymore. Not since Nurse Blainey started reporting severe burns to Black.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10206": "Just because there's no scorch marks on someone doesn't mean you haven't hurt them.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10207": "I'm simply saying that I'm not in favour of this persecution of first-years anymore. Or of anyone for that matter.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10208": "No. Of course not.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10209": "I wasn't screaming.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10210": "Well Garlick was stood right in front of me and I was paying attention to her –",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10211": "What's that supposed to mean?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10212": "I'm not 'sweet on Garlick'. I like her style, that's all. She has an elegance about her. Anyway, I wasn't screaming.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10213": "Yes, but I wasn't to know that was I? And there I was cursing – straight at Garlick's face!",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10214": "Yes, well we'll see how well you fare when a giant lethal plant brushes its spikes against you!",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10215": "Of what? Mimbulus mimbletonia? Did it ages ago. You haven't still not done yours, have you?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10216": "Oh, very considerate of you. No, I quite enjoyed it. Except for the boils. That part made me feel a bit sick.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10217": "Oh stop. And if you ever come near me with Stinksap I shall scream.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10218": "It wouldn't have been a Common Welsh Green, I can tell you that much.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10219": "His fault for being a first-year, isn't it?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10220": "That the one about the dragon fire? 'Distinguishing dragons by their flame?'",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10221": "I did mine ages ago, as soon as she assigned it. Not sure if I did it right though.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10222": "I put a lot in about the roar.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10223": "No, the roar of Howin – yes of course the roar of the dragons.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10224": "Yes well I know that. But I also added in that it has a melodious roar, with almost a musicality to it.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10225": "Hiccough sweets always do the trick.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10226": "Can't go wrong with Hiccough sweets. Quick jaunt to Zonko's and you'll be set.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10227": "What, playing a trick? I'm always up for a trick! Who's it on?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10228": "Then I am definitely in.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10249": "Your brain doesn't fill up.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10250": "Shockingly, I'm struggling to find the connection there.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10251": "Or has your grandmother also graced us with her clearly-expert opinion on the subject of memory?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10252": "Staggering that your grandmother isn't making headlines in the <i>Prophet</i> .",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10253": "You're not actually taking this ludicrous theory seriously are you?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10254": "I say we give up schooling altogether; head to your grandmother's. Evidently she is the true font of knowledge.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10255": "Oh for heaven's sake. Perhaps I'll simply have a skive instead. Why take such a perilous chance.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10256": "What? You can't be serious. Who on earth would be such a moonmind as to count their heartbeats? Preposterous.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10257": "Precisely. The entire notion is absurd.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10258": "What? No.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10259": "Oh for Merlin's sake. Fine. My brain's full. Which will explain why I have no recollection of how much I owe you.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10260": "For those Butterbeers you bought last week in Hogsmeade. That I have no recollection of. What a shame.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10261": "I don't feel well.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10262": "Not a chance. Last time I was in there she'd spilled a bottle of Skele-Gro and I swear I saw her topping it up!",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10263": "I don't know. Water or something.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10264": "Ah, but what if she did? And what if that Skele-Gro doesn't work properly now?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10265": "Well, what if, for instance, it only grew a half a bone? Or they grew in a funny shape? What about that?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10266": "I was feeling a bit anxious. So she gave me a tonic of some sort. Had a bit of crocodile heart in it I do believe.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10267": "What, the tonic? Yes. Yes, helped quite a bit, I'd say.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10268": "Well that's the thing. I'm thinking she mixed them up or something. And some Skele-Gro went in my tonic.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10269": "I think I'm growing an extra toe.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10270": "I already have the wormwood.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10271": "No, I do! I have everything!",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10272": "Haven't decided yet. I don't want to get in trouble and I think it's only supposed to be brewed in sixth year.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10273": "Of the elixir? Yes of course!",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10274": "It's called Elixir to Induce Euphoria.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10275": "My cousin told me it feels like Christmas.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10276": "Very likely. Course – I'll have to charge you.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10277": "To a dance?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10278": "Why? Because you don't have to ask someone?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10279": "Was only asking.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10280": "Yes that is a good point. I'd rather that than being left standing about like an abandoned Erumpent.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10281": "What? Yes, of course I am. And I don't feel like an abandoned Erumpent. Just that I could feel like one. At a dance.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10282": "Three of us? Oh yes, I much prefer that idea, yes. Any dances you've heard about coming up?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10283": "Oh Merlin's, what a relief.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10284": "I did say I was sorry.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10285": "I won't tell anyone again. Promise.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10286": "Yes it was definitely a good drawing there. You got a good likeness of him.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10287": "By whom?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10295": "I doubt Scribner would stand for that.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10296": "Not that one who makes things up?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10297": "Say no more.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10298": "You could have a hundred good reasons. None of them'll work with Scribner. Time to give up, I'd say.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10299": "Oh that part I completely understand. That's why you do those drawings of Black, isn't it? To go against the rules.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10300": "Not my point at all.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10301": "There. You learned something about yourself. Something that might have just saved you from being expelled.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10302": "Oh, well in that case I give up. Get caught for all I care.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10303": "I'd prefer they not be allowed to attend.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10304": "I heard one talking about sewing a sock the other day. How utterly revolting.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10305": "Oh really? Hmph.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10306": "I do like a few of their carols. Although they get all the facts wrong and clearly think any sort of 'vision' is an angel.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10307": "A recipe book?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10308": "Not sure why she'd fuss so much. It was only one page in a book.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10309": "What a fun game.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10310": "Finding folded down corners of books in the library. Ones that Scribner missed.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10311": "Well, no point discussing because I've already found a fatal flaw in our plan.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10312": "It involves risking unplanned encounters with Scribner. I say we play a round of Gobstones instead.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10313": "I could test you?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10314": "You already know the dates of every goblin rebellion that hasn't even happened yet.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10315": "Then I shall test you both. At the same time.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10316": "What? Why?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10317": "You're saying I need to take time to test each of you on the dates of goblin rebellions – separately?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10318": "What? Why?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale1_10319": "How utterly odd.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10000": "And that would be ridiculous.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10001": " Perhaps he's an Animagus.  And he's a cat – and he's got –",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10002": " Anyone got any Chocolate Frogs? I could just fancy one.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10003": "I'm surprised they're allowed to bring them into class though.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10004": "A unicorn? Are you a moonmind?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10005": "I don't believe you two. You'd have us overrun with Nifflers if it was up to you.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10006": "Listen to the pair of you – you're completely potty.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10007": "I – it – the horn! – obviously, its horn – which it could stab us with – ?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10008": "Nuzzle? It wouldn't just 'nuzzle' me; it'd impale me. Ugh. I can see I can't get anywhere with you two.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10009": "Am not. ",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10010": "Besides, what if it vanished in the middle of the lesson?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10011": "Don't you mean, they know our recipe for pancakes?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10012": "What – pancakes?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10013": "Ooh, this is getting a bit grim. Do you think we can get back to pancakes?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10014": "Do you think a horse can go faster than a broom?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10015": "A broom's better though, isn't it?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10016": "What'd be fun?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10017": "I already asked Kogawa. She said no.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10018": "I was only curious.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10019": "Yes, especially if they're faster than brooms.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10020": "Yes, I suppose I'd keep that one 'under my hat' if I were you.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10021": "I'd keep that one 'under my hat' if I were you.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10022": "I wish I came from money.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10023": "Except being able to buy whatever you want in Hogsmeade.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10024": "Oh, can I get one too?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10025": "I still don't get it.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10026": "I like Ronen's jokes. I find him very witty.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10027": "Don't listen to them. I think you're at least as funny as Peeves.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10028": "It was terrifying.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10029": "It wasn't 'a' Puffskein – it was a 'herd' of them, or whatever you call them when there's a lot of them. A lot.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10030": "You weren't there – in my dream –",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10031": "Their little tongues were all around my face, dabbing at me –",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10032": "Yes. Dabbing.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10033": "No. It was definitely dabbing. And I shan't be comfortable going to sleep again now after that awful nightmare.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10034": "Oh, that'd be good. Yes, that's what I need; a soothing draught.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10035": "Mine would be the Kneazle that lurks about our back garden at home.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10036": "Definitely.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10037": "I didn't say cat, I said Kneazle.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10038": "Oh, well that's very comforting, isn't it? And what if this attacking Kneazle deems my mere presence untoward?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10039": " I knew I shouldn't have told you.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10040": "Sharp didn't think much of it at all.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10041": "He wrote on it, 'I don't think much of this at all.'",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10042": "Yes. Except I was looking at the wrong line so I got them all out of order.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10043": "Yes.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10044": "Well, I will, won't I. Doesn't matter anyway. Not like Sharp thinks much of anybody's work.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10045": "I knew he hated me.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10046": "The man's a monster. I swear he'd prefer running this school if it had no one in it. I'm sure that he hates me.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10047": "Not to mention, he gives out an absurd amount of detentions.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10048": "He gave me five for leaning my hands on the desk while he was speaking.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10049": "But he wasn't even talking to me.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10050": "If Black's mission is to gain respect – I'd say it's impossible.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10051": "He was having a go at Weasley. Telling her she needs to be more firm with her students.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10052": "I'd say.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10053": "I hear his residence is charming. Grimmauld Place. Perhaps you can take a trip and they'll let you have tea in his chair.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10054": "My grandfather's a plumber.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10055": "I'm not fibbing. Why would I fib? He's a Squib, ended up working at a Muggle factory. Does well, he does.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10056": "Does all that newfangled plumbing. They say he's marvellous with a septic tank.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10057": "I'm not making it up!",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10058": "I mean – it's only what I heard.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10059": "Oh, I've always wanted to play cricket. Brilliant game. They play with a bat.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10060": "No! It's a wooden one.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10061": "I'm listening. Was just wondering about the bat, the wood – doesn't matter.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10062": "We playing then?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10063": "Ah. Well. That'd be why we don't play cricket.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10064": "Clever though, secrecy, isn't it? Good what they did, coming up with that Statute.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10065": "Shame though about the cricket. And the thing is, they might like to use a real bat.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10066": "She's definitely my favourite.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10067": "What do you mean?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10068": "I thought she was. Yes, I remember now.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10069": "Oh, I remember that. Yes, that was funny. Smashed some dishes apparently, with the cries.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10070": "– not really good to have Mandrakes in a kitchen, is it. When you think about it.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10071": "The thing is –",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10072": "Oh, you can mark my words I shall have my revenge. I don't care if Quidditch never comes back; it will happen.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10073": "Bothered about? I should think I'm betrayed, wounded to the core; my trust in my brethren forever broken.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10074": "Wha –  no. No. This isn't about ink, or the phlegm of magical worms! This is about being wronged.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10075": "This is about being crossed, beyond repair. Friendship forsaken and left to burn in the pyre of a phoenix.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10076": "Do? They didn't do anything. It's what they said. That's what has sparked this inferno of scorn.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10077": "Said I – fly like a Diricawl.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10078": "What? No.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10079": "Well, if ever our buffoon of a headmaster comes to his senses and we play again, I shall charm the Quaffle.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10080": "To attack him. We'll see who flies like a Diricawl.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10081": "And it was in front of Astoria Crickett so it was especially humiliating.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10082": "I shall face the wrath of the Department of Magical Games and Sports if I have to, to reclaim my honour.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10083": "Well – don't I need to, I don't know, avenge myself? Just in case – Astoria noticed.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10084": "Really. Well that's far less likely to get me expelled.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10085": "Er, yes. I think it is.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10086": "I suppose she's not wrong.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10087": "That confounded man.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10088": "I wish he'd get dragon pox.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10089": "What's that?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10090": "I don't think they'd last through one game.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10091": "That and his precious beard.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10092": "True. Except what we need is a Professor Black poison.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10093": "If what's in your family?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10094": "Who? Who's lucky?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10095": "Yes of course practice is good. I must say your philosophies on sport seem somewhat – fickle.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10096": "I'd say the Bludgers were practically avoiding you for fear of embarrassment.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10097": "Yes. We don't mean to offend you in any way.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10098": "I was just trying to think of someone who was a worse player than you.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10099": "I would've cast <i>Glacius</i>.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10100": "On their brooms. Make them hard to hold onto.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10101": "So that I'm clear, a rat was in your Wellington boot?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10102": "Oh. Niffler's better than a rat I suppose.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10103": "I reckon he'd have an orchestra if they'd let him.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10104": "Oh dear. How awful.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10105": "What happened? To his son?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10106": "Why would he think his son dead?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10107": "Yes. I should think I have a new respect for him.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10108": "I never have, right from when I was a child. I couldn't even stand on the landing without feeling dizzy.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10109": "What? Why would you do that?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10110": "I didn't. But what choice did I have? I was too afraid to tell my father. He was a star Seeker in his day.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10111": "But – why? As long as I fly and do my part, why should they care?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10112": "It is in my family. You won't tell anyone will you?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10113": "Wish I'd never said anything now.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10114": "Bu – you can't tell on me. Kogawa might stop me from playing. And then my father would find out.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10115": "Why did you even tell me this? This doesn't support the suggestion at all that I tell my father.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale2_10116": "Oh? And how did that go?",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale3_10000": "Miss Peck from Brood and Peck said a customer lost a Diricawl round here.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale3_10001": "I know we're not supposed to go down there – I just thought –",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale3_10002": "Very sorry father. Only she said I might earn a reward. Instead I just wasted our time.",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale3_10003": "There you are! Ha! Finally, I'll have enough for that Wind Wisp!",
  "T3StudentGryffindorMale3_10004": "Ah. Well. Not meant to be.  Also, I may have knocked over a dustbin back there.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10000": "I thought your mother was nice?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10001": "Apology accepted. But why would your mother send you a Howler? Seems rather – extreme?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10002": "Your sister sounds charming.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10003": "Oh – Horklumps can be quite nasty. They spread quickly too, can ruin a garden almost overnight –",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10004": "You can call me 'Professor'.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10005": "People were talking about it in the girls' lavatory so it must've been – memorable.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10006": "I'm sure Garlick would have a suggestion for you? At least it's just Horklumps –",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10007": "Well – I'm just saying. My auntie once had an infestation of Bundimuns in her floorboards. Oh, now that's a stench.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10008": "Rotten to have Horklumps, I'm sure, but you'd be getting more than a Howler if it was, say, a Venomous Tentacula.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10009": " Quite a logical outcome really; excess of earthworms – completely plausible to attract Hork –",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10015": "Well, perhaps it's because I work harder. Your Mandrake did nearly die.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10016": "That's absurd. I don't think she even knows I'm there.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10017": "All I'm saying is, I exhibited far more knowledge of Devil's Snare and it didn't seem to count for anything.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10018": "Potty? What do you mean, potty?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10019": "Yes?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10020": "Oh. Oh, I see. I suppose that is rather different then, isn't it? – do you think I could borrow your homework?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10021": " See?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10022": "When my mother was here, it was a different professor. Apparently, nowhere near as nice as Weasley.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10023": "I don't know why you'd be scared. It's not as if anything can happen while the teacher's around.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10024": "Although there was that one time that Hilda turned Astoria Cricket into a worm.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10025": "Oh, it wasn't serious.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10026": "I don't know why you're so worried. Just don't sit next to Hilda. Simple as that.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10027": "Oh wait – or Grace –",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10028": "Never mind.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10029": "How can they not? If I'd grown up with a sister who was a player, I'm sure my skills on the pitch would be better.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10030": "What do you mean?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10031": "Mm, yes. I suppose you're right.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10032": "Bad habits?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10033": "Yes. Yes, I suppose you're right. Not really a need for accuracy on the moors is there?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10034": "Gosh, I didn't think I'd feel so relieved. But you're right. I have absolutely no skill whatsoever. What a good job.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10035": "Oof. I'm so glad I don't have a sister.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10036": "Beg your pardon?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10037": "Oh, that's right. And Swivenhodge. That used a pig's bladder! We've a nerve to complain then, haven't we?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10038": "Oh, that's a secret. The Department of Magical Games and Sports doesn't want us 'getting ideas'.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10039": "1538 wasn't it? When they banned using them against the other team?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10040": "Apparently they'd set fire to an opponent's broom tail, and attack it with a club! Barbarians, we were!",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10041": "If you think it's boring, next time we play I'd be happy to attack you with an axe.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10042": "Then I fully concur. It's beyond boring. Next time I play I shall fly with the intent to collide.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10043": "(giggling)",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10044": "I dream of being as good as Eunice Murray. I never could be though.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10045": "Gosh, can you imagine?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10046": "That's nice of you to say. I think it's what she said that intimidates me.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10047": "Eunice. Eunice Murray.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10048": "Yes. That's precisely what I'm referring to. Can you imagine? – someone thinking the Snitch too slow?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10049": "What do you mean?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10050": "You think it's about the broom then?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10051": "You really think the Magpies would take me one day?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10052": "You're not a bad chap for a Slytherin, are you?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10053": "I knew I could smell a rat. But thank you. Really.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10054": "I could just imagine Black dipping his toes into a hot foot bath and finding a bar of Frog Spawn Soap.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10055": "I think it's funny.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10056": "I think he made it up though, don't you?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10057": "I wonder why he chose to say it was Black?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10058": "Silly of him though, to say he'd put the Frog Spawn Soap in Black's foot bath.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10059": "If he'd told us he'd played a trick on someone – less notorious, well, we might have believed him.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10060": "Why do you say that? You think his talk's bigger than his walk?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10061": "Really? Now that I think of it, I did see him last week looking a bit distraught. Had he done something awful?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10062": "I thought your sister was well-behaved?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10063": "Surely one Stink Pellet couldn't bring about such change?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10064": "Oh dear. It sounds dreadful.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10065": "Why does your mother keep buying her the Stink Pellets?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10066": "That does sound rather absurd. Can't you buy her something else green? What about a frog?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10067": "Although –",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10068": "There is the chance that she'll take to the frog and still want to keep using Stink Pellets for the green smoke.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10069": "Or you could simply wait until she grows out of it.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10070": "A few years. No point living in a vile cesspit of stink. I'd simply stay away.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10071": "For Merlin's sake stop going on about this. Learn the Bubble-Head Charm and have done with it.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10072": "It's an obvious solution. When you go home you can live a perfectly normal life.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10073": "Perhaps cast it when you're near me so I won't be able to hear any more about this horrendously naughty sister.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10074": "I'll take an odorous projectile any day.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10075": "I dropped two outside the library last week.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10076": "Yes. It was fantastic. Scribner was red as a Chinese Fireball.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10077": "The smoke was so thick I reckon I could've sneaked into the Restricted Section.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10078": "No. Doesn't interest me. If I'm going to get detention I'd rather it involve something that came from Zonko's.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10079": "No. I truly only want to make horribly bad smells. Mainly in the vicinity of nuisance first-years.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10080": "Exactly. I like most of the professors. Especially Garlick. I try to be the most considerate towards her.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10081": "Of course.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10082": "That's absurd. You could pick any point in history and say that's when everything changed.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10083": "Because things are changing all the time. That's the point of history.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10084": "Yes, and I had a cheese sandwich yesterday that was the best one I've ever had. It was especially unique.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10085": "Yes well I'm not just 'anyone' am I?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10086": "Yes, we must get back to your point.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10087": "Like my cheese sandwich.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10088": "I did twenty-six hours of homework last week.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10089": "How did you know?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10090": "That's far too much responsibility for one person to bear. Besides, I'm sure you're warming his heart.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10091": "When you stood up and answered his question on the Werewolf Code of Conduct, I swear he shed a tear.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10092": "Howin doesn't mean anyone any harm. What are you talking about?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10093": "Do you think she's still annoyed that you answered her back that day? Over the Puffskein food?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10094": "I was a bit surprised. Answering Garlick back'd be one thing, but Howin? You're lucky you made it out alive.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10095": "You'll simply have to be more polite to teachers in future.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10096": "There was literally one thing she said about it; how could you not note it down?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10097": "In Herbology? Fine. But be forewarned; I mainly drew a picture of a bush.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10098": "If Weasley had seen them, they'd soon be out.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10099": "Yes, I've seen you cast <i>Glacius</i>. It's as if a snowman has the hiccups.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10100": "No need to be like that. Anyway, he was only practising with matches.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10101": "I'm sure you didn't simply Transfigure a hedgehog your first try.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10102": "You'd have been had if she didn't know your mother.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10103": "I think you'd do well with a little stall. I can see you now with your troves of Honking Daffodils.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10104": "How very gentlemanly of you. I'm sure you'll have the girls and boys swooning.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale1_10105": "Handsome chap like you won't be shy of suitors. Shall you still charge me more?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10009": "Oh, wouldn't that be marvellous.  Imagine if she brought in a unicorn.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10010": "Yes. What on earth could be bad about bringing a unicorn to class?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10011": "(gasp) Can you imagine? I think we should ask Professor Howin if we can bring them in.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10012": "Don't be silly; it'd just nuzzle you.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10013": "I'm sure the teacher wouldn't present it in class if she thought it would disappear.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10014": "Oh – that's horrible.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10015": "If the Muggles were able to use Diricawls in their mines, well – it'd simply disappear. No death needed.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10016": "Yes, well it likely would be. Unless you were an impatient sort, I suppose.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10017": "Oh, I don't know. Horses can go quite fast, I've heard. They race them in some parts.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10018": "Oh, that'd be fun.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10019": "If we could enchant a horse – so we could fly on it. Oh, how fun.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10020": "Oh, I can't believe she said no. I think my mother knows a friend of hers. I shan't let this drop.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10021": "I'm sure the prefects would have found her out if she was.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10022": "Oh dear.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10023": "Oh, I'd find it quite thrilling. I think they're fantastic little creatures.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10024": "You're all extremely boring. Next time I'm planning something festive, I'll shall be sure to not invite any of you.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10025": "Please do. I shall look forward to it.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10026": "Oh, I bought one from him recently. Excellent, it was. Beautiful illustrations of beasts.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10027": "Well, there's an entire chapter on the Hippocampus. Did you know they have transparent eggs?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10028": "Oh, let me know and I'll come with you.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10029": "Good. If you need any assistance with Beasts, I can always help you. I love that class.  Despite Howin.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10030": "Oh stop. I'm already taken if you must know.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10031": "I met someone at Steepley's if you must know and I don't mind saying, they're rather delightful.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10032": "But did you ever not get what you wanted? On your birthday, for example.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10033": "That's absurd. You almost drowned your own Mandrake.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10034": "Yes, she was a bit lax there, I'd say. Too much racket no doubt; I don't know how she thinks with those things going.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10035": "Don't worry, it wasn't that funny.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10036": "Stop being so mean. You're just jealous because you need a field of Alihotsy to get someone to even crack a smile.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10037": "We don't think you're very sharp-witted either.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10038": "I can imagine.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10039": "Don't get yourself worked up, now. It was only a nightmare.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10040": "I'm sure Nurse Blainey could give you some sort of draught – to help soothe you.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10041": "How very – unusual. I'm quite partial to Kneazles myself.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10042": "Oh, mine? Definitely Black. The man terrifies me.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10043": "You don't need to fear them, you know. They'll only attack if they think you're up to something untoward.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10044": "Er – oh, I don't think that would happen. You'd have to look, I don't know, scary or something.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10045": "Don't mind him. He told me once his Boggart's an imp with a custard pie.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10046": "I found a flower on my composition book once.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10047": "Yes!",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10048": "What? – oh.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10049": "Oh. Well, it's fine, it doesn't matter. I don't care. It was just a flower.  A rose. A red rose.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10050": "Oh. Oh, goodness. I wouldn't want one. I mean – depending upon who it was from of course.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10051": "Oh, don't be silly. Who has notes from Potions?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10052": "You're so mean.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10053": "What – I mean, I don't mean to rude but – what did this person say, exactly?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10054": "It's not my business, but it seems a little – excessive. Why make him so important as to take such risk?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10055": "No. Not at all. I should think Astoria would be thrilled if you simply invited her for a Butterbeer.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10056": "It's just the same for me. My sister wore her uniform till it was threadbare and my mother still passed it on to me.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10057": "I wouldn't mind if it was only my normal school uniform, but for Quidditch it certainly helps if it fits.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10058": "I wish he'd simply change his mind.  I suppose there is one good thing.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10059": "By the time Quidditch comes back we'll all have grown into our uniforms.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10060": "They ride horses.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10061": "I'm simply saying that if Muggles have the wherewithal to ride horses, they might possibly do well in Quidditch.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10062": "I believe she's agreeing with you.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10063": "What do you mean? How is a brand-new Wind Wisp second-rate?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10064": "Oh. Second-rate and second-hand.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10065": "How do you know it's used anyway?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10066": "Did you ask him?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10067": "About his sales price. Perhaps he could have made a concession for you; in light of the dust.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10068": "How else can he have the chance to adjust the price?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10069": "The Wind Wisp? Did the rain give it a good wash then?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10070": "Yes. I feel they're fair.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10071": "He must be the youngest shopkeeper in Hogsmeade, I think.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10072": "So much effort and for what end?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10073": "But Quidditch is a tradition isn't it? People will probably play it for thousands of years.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10074": "Not just about getting some air in your lungs then?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10075": "On what?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10076": "We shall hold you to that when Black brings it back. If Black brings it back.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10077": "Why? What are you offering in return?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10078": "Very clever.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10079": "He could've chewed through the soles if I hadn't caught him in time.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10080": "Rats are highly intelligent, almost as clever as us I'd say.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10081": "Not really. Surprise is more like it. My own fault for not putting my Wellingtons away after the walk.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10082": "I had put my good shoes on near the greenhouse, ready to come back into school, and forgot my boots. Silly me.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10083": "I'd thought it to be a rat; a large one. But when it climbed out of my boot it was a Niffler.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10084": "Well, I do keep a lucky Knut in my boot.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10085": "Well – whenever I have my lucky Knut, I always find something useful.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10086": "Yes. I found some Fluxweed seed. A little paper bag filled with them.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10087": "Yes, that's what I thought too. I shall keep it, in case I hear of someone who lost some.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10088": "I shall see. But that's the sort of thing that happens when I have my lucky Knut.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10089": "Yes of course you can borrow it. Any time you like.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10090": "Oh, you can borrow it too if you like.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10091": "Oh, I don't think it works like that.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10092": "I did nothing of the sort.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10093": "That was for an assignment from Sharp.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10094": "Oh shut up. Sharp likely sees you can barely keep a cauldron upright.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10095": "Good.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10096": "Of course I didn't. I didn't need to; he was clearly taken by me.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10097": "Oh do shut up.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10098": "Because – he doesn't think the Chudley Cannons are a good team.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10099": "Exactly.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10100": "Now you see my dilemma.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10101": "Really?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10102": "Oh good. That's a relief. In the meantime, should I simply ignore the other one?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10103": "But I don't understand. How could you ever think you'd do well on a broom if you're afraid of heights?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10104": "No of course not.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10105": "I think you should tell your father. Stand up for yourself. You might be surprised anyway. Perhaps he'll be fine.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale2_10106": "Yes I hadn't really thought about it that way.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale6_10000": "Oh no! – Sir Fitzroy! – my toad! He’s left me!",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale6_10001": "There he is!",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale6_10002": "Er – nothing, Professor Weasley –",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale6_10003": "You telltale, it was not!",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale6_10004": "Oh Fitzroy, you naughty boy –",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale6_10005": "Argh! What in Merlin's – ? What a stupid thing to do!",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffFemale6_10006": "It's the most stupid thing anyone has ever done! Urgh!",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10000": "She is – but it's my baby sister – caused all this fuss. I hate sisters – sorry.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10001": "Exactly!  It's my little sister. She likes to play with earthworms. So last time I was home I found some for her –",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10002": "She's the worst sister ever. I get her the earthworms and next thing you know we've got Horklumps. My mum's livid.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10003": "Yes, all right 'Professor'. That's exactly what happened. They ruined the garden almost overnight.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10004": "Very funny. You don't know how embarrassing it was to have a Howler show up in front of everyone.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10005": "Oh, that's very helpful to know; thank you for that.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10006": "'Just – Horklumps'?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10007": "If my leg was chopped off, would you tell me I'm lucky to still have my head? Just curious?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10008": "Remind me never to bring up my problems when I'm talking to you. ",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10009": "Yes, all right. We know some of us like Herbology. ",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10010": "What didn't shrink?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10011": "(chuckles) I'll say. That's not going to help you much around thieves, is it?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10012": "(chuckles) Don't worry. I once bought a pair of 'sturdy trousers' from Gladrags. Made of leather, or so I thought –",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10013": "'Ah,' I said, 'these'll be exceptional to protect my legs from all the bramble in the forest!'",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10014": "Turns out the trousers were Moke skin. Oh deary me, I can tell you – nothing in those trousers was protected. Ugh.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10015": "Absolutely. Course, it doesn't hurt if you've got a Yew Weaver.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10016": "Yes. Parents bought it for me for my birthday. To make up for the neglect.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10017": "Oh, don't sound worried. Trust me, it's a good thing.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10018": "Ever since my baby sister was born, they've been completely occupied with her.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10019": "They make up for it by buying me practically anything I ask for. It's really quite grand.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10020": "Are you not then?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10021": "Mm. That's a shame.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10022": "Well, if Spintwitches does any sort of promotion, on the Yew Weaver, I can let you know?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10023": "I'm just grateful we don't have to play with a dragon's bladder.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10024": "Quidditch. Used to be played with a dragon's bladder. In Germany at least. Stichstock the game was called.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10025": "I might complain that it's slightly hard to work out what the seven hundred ways to foul are.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10026": "At least we get to take our wands on the pitch; that's somewhat comforting. Not that you can use them.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10027": "Oh, can you imagine the fun they had using them on the opposition!",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10028": "Makes us seem very civilised now, doesn't it? Almost boring.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10029": "A likely plan. They banned that too!",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10030": "That's the spirit.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10031": "(chuckling)",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10032": "You didn't.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10033": "Surely that wouldn't be at all comparable to an iron Bludger?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10034": "You made your own Bludger out of scarab beetles and dung?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10035": "How can dung and dead beetles possibly be better than a real Bludger?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10036": "You actually played with this unsanitary piece of sporting gear?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10037": "I'm not sure I've seen you play on the pitch; the actual Hogwarts pitch. I've seen you pottering about the moors.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10038": "N – no.  Can't say I have.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10039": "Mm – I don't think I saw other students on the moors. Not flying. It was only you. That's why I remember it.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10040": "Do you not feel I'm confident?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10041": "Oh. I see. I suppose if you're offering to let me use your dung Bludger –",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10042": "Your beetle Bludger. I'd like to borrow it then please. I could do with a bit more confidence now that I think of it.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10054": "She'd come back from Zonko's. What sort were you expecting?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10055": "I don't know why you're so bothered. I found the whole thing rather funny.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10056": "Then they're aptly named, aren't they?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10057": "Was it a burning sensation would you say? Or more of a popping?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10058": "Yes, you did look rather flushed now that I think of it.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10059": "I think not. I'm more of a Fizzing Whizzbees sort of chap.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10060": "She was. Until my mother bought her a Stink Pellet. Now she's become this – delirious monster.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10061": "It's serious. I think it's the green smoke. It's her favourite colour. I can't believe my mother didn't think of that.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10062": "It is. Every time I'm at home it's as though we're living in a swamp. A vile green cesspit of a swamp.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10063": "Because she spoils her. My mother's happy to wear a scarf around her face to block the smell, it's ridiculous.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10064": "A frog? – a frog! You're a genius. A bright green spectacular frog! That's a brilliant idea!",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10065": "What? What is it? 'Although' what?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10066": "Ugh. That would be terrible. Awful. An ordeal beyond compare. No. It's off. The frog's off.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10067": "Grows out of it? How long would that take?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10068": "Seems rather – extreme. Not to go home.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10069": "The Bubble-Head Charm.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10070": "I can have a normal life. I can walk about as though I have a fish bowl on my head, living a perfectly normal life.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10071": "Yes, I'm aware. Muggles have a lot of different words for things. They might as well be French.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10072": "I'm sure it's nothing like it in the least. With the exception that it can go horribly wrong.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10073": "What? No. No, of course not.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10074": "Well they do go wrong though, don't they? Sometimes.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10075": "I'm not saying it was my fault that I forgot the spine of lionfish. Just that I was focused more on the belladonna.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10076": "Oh, I mean, nothing serious. I'd forgotten that belladonna was the one that was also called Deadly Nightshade.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10077": "It appears I had the entirely wrong recipe and I ended up hallucinating.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10078": "Nothing drastic. I was suddenly at Durmstrang and started to tell off the teachers for using Dark Magic.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10079": "Then a Bulgarian boy set a Cockatrice on me. Vicious beak they've got, those things.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10080": "Ah, well I can see why you'd say that. But the thing is, it was only a hallucination.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10081": "Oh no, I had scrapes all over me! From fighting the Cockatrice. In my mind.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10082": "Come to think of it, I'd imagine Muggle chemistry is a lot safer.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10083": "Let me guess. Catching up on History of Magic?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10084": "By the disappointed look on Binns's face every time he sees you. I think you're breaking his heart.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10085": "I don't mind Binns if I'm honest. People moan about him, but he doesn't mean anyone any harm. Not like Howin.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10086": "She certainly means me harm. It's a wonder she hasn't put a Basilisk under my desk.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10087": "She's never been the same since.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10088": "Yes, lesson officially learned. Oh, meant to ask: can I copy your Herbology notes about privet?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale1_10089": "I was working on History of Magic.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10000": "I highly doubt she's after being turned into that.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10001": "You worry far too much. I'm a Hufflepuff and I shan't be letting anyone turn me into a Venomous Tentacula.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10002": "You're worrying far too much. Now, if you play up in class, get on Weasley's bad side, well you might deserve to be turned into a plant.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10003": "Stop. As you say, Hufflepuffs are inclined towards plants. If you get turned into one I'll be sure to prune you.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10004": "I'm not saying you have to be boring. But surely people admire someone who's kind – and loyal – ?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10005": "Yes, we all know who you admire. I'm sure Everett Clopton's ears are burning.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10006": "How can you say that? Of course they are. It's what all of us strive to be.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10007": "Ugh, that's such a lie.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10009": "I'm literally going to be sick.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10010": "Bravo Gryffindor. Willing to risk your life at a moment's notice.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10011": "Drawn out the lion, don't you mean?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10012": "Nearly dying, you mean?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10013": "You do know you're a wizard.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10014": "Oh, hello Madam Kogawa.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10015": " 'Oh hello Madam Kogawa.'",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10016": "I'm not encouraging you.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10017": "Yes, well she might expel me.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10018": "Speak for yourself. I've seen a rat in our common room and it could be rather handy to have a light at night.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10019": "Well, I might have come with you – but now you've got me thinking how useful it would be to turn a rat into a lamp.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10020": "He never shuts up about you.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10021": "Fine. I'm making it all up.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10022": "I swear, I can't win around here. Next time I shall keep Clopton's musings to myself.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10023": "My lips are sealed.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10024": "I can't say I find it too distracting myself.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10025": "It's a very quiet whisper though. I think you're making a bit of a fuss.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10026": "Point well taken.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10027": "But to be clear, you feel the library's an acceptable place for a Tongue-Tying Hex?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10028": "Nobody saw me. I don't see the harm.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10029": "I just thought he'd like to get out of his cage for a bit.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10030": "You don't know him. Balthazar's very sensitive. Very partial to the library.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10031": "I wouldn't mind. Balthazar's quite partial to detention.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10032": "Who says I was trying to impress anyone. I don't see why you're making a fuss – ?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10033": "But – the fact we're having this conversation is – fuss.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10034": "Yes, I heard her. Stop. Just stop – making a fuss. ",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10035": "I'm happy to let you know, but I'm not sure it's as exciting as you might think.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10036": "Oh, how – thrilling.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10037": "Next time – ?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10038": "You're not hopeless. Just not very good.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10039": "Thanks for that.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10040": "(sigh) Thanks for that.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10041": "Tell on them, did you?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10042": "(laughing)",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10043": "What kind was it anyway?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10044": "Broom! You need a Remembrall you do.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10045": "Well, they won't be having that for long. Kogawa can spot an unauthorised broom a mile away.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10046": "Perhaps you should tell on them. Then it'll get confiscated and you can go and steal it from Black's cupboard.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10047": "Don't tell me one little arm break and you're already out? It was only an experimental manoeuvre, that was all.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10048": "That is true. Fascinating tales she's got. You want to get her telling you about bewitched big toes. Ugh, it's chilling.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10049": "Tell us about your injuries then? Go on.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10050": "Funny that. Last I heard you'd been bitten by an enchanted bee and had a buzzing elbow for a week.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10051": "I beg to differ. It is my belief that a buzzing anything is in fact ripe for callous, unfettered mockery.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10052": "Ha, yes. A buzzing nose. That would've been a good one.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10053": "Obviously not.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10054": "No! We just meant, if you were a bit dead, we'd probably be more excited than if you were just a bit – buzzy.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10055": "Oh. You don't want that then. Not when you're fifty feet in the air.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10056": "Have you not had good experiences with Quidditch then? With Snitches?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10059": "And some. My sister was going to buy me a new one but then she took up a new hobby and that was that.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10060": "She was enchanting quills to write the essays. Going through ink like a Crup at a water bowl.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10061": "Writing essays on Patronuses.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10062": "When I reminded her about the new broom she simply said she'd run out of money from buying all the ink.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10063": "No, she's right.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10064": "It's literally that: a big fierce bear.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10065": "I've sent her an owl with a drawing of your decrepit thing. I reckon that'll give her the hint.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10066": "If the shape you're after's a chimney. ",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10067": "No good playing on an empty stomach.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10068": "Yes. It does. If you've had too many Cauldron Cakes, then you're bearing down on a Quaffle, Snitch in sight –",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10069": "Yes. That's what I was saying – when you interrupted.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10070": "As I was saying, that concentration; you're watching the Snitch, minding the Bludgers, and in a split second –",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10071": "What?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10072": "What are you talking about, 'stomach rumbles'?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10073": "Yes. As I was saying. That being the pertinent phrase of the moment.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10074": "As I was saying, you're leaning in, so hard you think your broom's going to snap, and then –",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10075": "I give up. I might as well head out into the world and try to have a conversation with a Jarvey.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10076": "You can't believe a word she says.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10077": "And one minute she's saying her uncle invented cricket and the next she's saying she's a pure-blood.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10078": "I'm very sorry, but you can't be both. I'd like to see a pure-blood have anything to do with cricket.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10079": "What?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10080": "Good job there's no Slytherins about hearing you say that. How should I know who invented cricket?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10081": "Well that's not much good then, is it.  Do you want to know any other things?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10082": "Muggle sports.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10083": "What? N – no, no, it doesn't. I'm not interested in Muggle sports. Not at all. Why are we talking about this?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10084": "It shouldn't be allowed.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10085": "I mean no offence whatsoever, but what would a housekeeper know about our cancelled Quidditch?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10086": "Well? Have you heard anything from this housekeeper?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10087": "All I know is that for a school of such renown as Hogwarts – to cancel Quidditch – warrants looking into.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10088": "It's nothing to jest about.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10089": "You don't have a father who's been declaring you next in line for the Quidditch Cup since you were three.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10090": "How's that?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10091": "What's the worst that could happen?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10092": "Well. Besides that.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10093": "I still think it'd be worth it.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10094": "We deserve to play – and play we should!",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10095": "You haven't heard the complete idea yet so how can you judge it to be absurd?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10096": "Just – hear me out: we meet at midnight, at the pitch.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10097": "We play! We practise! What harm are we doing to chase about our brooms in the dead of night? What harm?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10098": "That's not fair! You'd already decided you were going to say that before I even said anything.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10099": "Yes. It is a mutiny. And so it should be.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10100": "What right does one man have to cancel the most beloved part of our entire school year? It's an outrage.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10101": "And I want it on record that that man is going to be the least popular headmaster that Hogwarts ever has.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10102": "Yes. That'd be fine. Don't forget it's your turn to pay.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10103": "It was only my opinion. Should've heard them. You'd think I'd said we should play wearing blindfolds.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10104": "Might be silly to you but you're more adept on a broom than I am.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10105": "Thank you. I shall remember that next time your cauldron overflows in Potions. Shan't stand in front next time.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10106": "I suppose we should be thankful we don't have to fly on uprooted trees. That's how they used to do it.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10107": "And imagine soaring through the air with a pile of branches in your face.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10108": "Oh good. That would've been a shame. Wonder if it was robins?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10110": "Do you really reckon starling eggs are better than blackbirds'? I find the brown spots rather ornate myself.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10111": "I'd still like to see it played with a Snidget – without a Repelling Charm.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10112": "It could escape, I don't care. In fact it would escape with no Repelling Spells to keep it to the confines of the arena.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10113": "You should be glad of Bowman Wright of Godric’s Hollow. He's the man behind the Golden Snitch.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10114": "Clever man, our Bowman Wright, clever, clever man.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10128": "I find her quite terrifying.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10129": "She's in detention more time than she's in class.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10130": "Oh heavens no. I have to sit two desks away from her in Charms and I make sure I never even look at her.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10131": "Misinterpret it? Misinterpret what?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10132": "A sign?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10133": "Oh gosh. I wouldn't want that. For her to think I was being defiant.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10134": "Hex me?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10135": "Oh goodness. Now I'm worried about even going to Charms.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10136": "What do you mean, that's that?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10137": "Oh dear. He's in raptures when she gives me the Hiccough sweets. Oh dear, oh dear – what am I to do?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10138": "Really? You're not frightened of her?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10139": "Yes, I'll do your Charms homework for you. Whatever you need. Thank you.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10140": "What? I'm not that good in Charms.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10141": "That's how nice she is. She saw us and pretended not to see.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10142": "What, because she lets us eat Sugar Quills in class and pretends not to see?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10143": "Ha, there aren't enough mirrors in the class for that.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10144": "Are we certain there's not a portrait of you hanging in Black's office? Not related to him are you?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10145": "In Black's case, being a Muggle-hating charmgrinder seemed to do the trick.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10146": "She is the prettiest professor, I'll give you that. As pretty as Sharp is handsome.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10147": "That was last term.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10148": "Oh I remember that. You didn't stop blushing for weeks.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10149": "Oh, so you can make a mess of it and turn his legs into feathers instead.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10150": "I say we let him be the one to cast the Trip Jinx on Sharp.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10151": "What? Your grandmother bought Nose-Biting Teacups?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10152": "All right, Headmaster, keep your drawers on.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10153": "That they're fine pickings for Dementors.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10154": "Is she still alive, your grandmother?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10155": "Wasn't it your grandmother's birthday a few days ago?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10156": "No I did not. You're always making things up.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10157": "There. I shan't have my pristine reputation as a below average wizard smeared.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10158": "Oh, you absolute traitor.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10159": "Well in that case, yes. It was definitely me.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10160": "My fee is one inch for Charms and a Butterbeer.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10161": "That's why you don't use normal ones silly.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10162": "What, a normal teacup?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10163": "Yes but, why would you do that when you can get the actual enchanted ones at Zonko's? And for a good price.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10164": "That's a ridiculous idea. What if the enchantment goes wrong and you actually seriously hurt someone?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10165": "That's what I've been trying to say for the last half an hour. Get the Nose-Biting Teacups from Zonko's.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10166": "You little Crupmite, I knew it.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10167": "I couldn't decide between the Frog Spawn Soap and the Dungbombs.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10168": "I can imagine.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10169": "Thrilled to bits! Says my brother's never been so well behaved since the day he had that bath.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10170": "Be thankful I wasn't aiming it at you.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10171": "You're lucky he wasn't hungry.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10172": "They're not revolting. Puffskeins are brilliant. I'd have a poffle of them if I could.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10173": "Be rude all you want; I shall have the last laugh when I've saved up my Galleons from all the hair.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10174": "Puffskein hair. I've got bags of the stuff. And one day I shall sell it and then you'll be crying.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10175": "For potions.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10176": "See?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10177": "I'm happy to share. As long as I can sit with you both, at the dinner table – since no one ever wants to sit by me.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10178": "He's under my bed. And I've told you, his name's Balthazar.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10179": "No one's trying to impress anyone.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10180": "I honestly don't care.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10181": "Why must you keep insisting that I'm out to impress her. I did it for fun, not to impress her, nor you.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10182": "What?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10183": "Oh, oh well – thank you. Thank you very much. I confess I was secretly hoping you'd like it.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10184": "I thought it was 'Wealth and loyalty'.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10185": "Hmph. Like a code, isn't it.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10186": "Words. And how people say them differently, depending on where they're from. It's like a code.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10187": "What? No! I – well, I tried a draught someone had made.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10188": "A first-year. She seemed really nice.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10189": "No. Not that one. The one who scratches her head a lot and says it's wasp bites.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10190": "Why? Why wouldn't you trust her?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10191": "Have I been – Concocted?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10192": "So you've said.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10193": "So you've said.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10194": "Anyway, I had a new one didn't I? Wind Wisp. I'd have it now if someone hadn't cast the Disillusionment Charm on it.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10195": "It's true. There's a boy in our common room. Had his eye on it the second I got it.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10196": "He told me.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10197": "H – how did you know? Yes, it was him.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10198": "(sigh)",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10199": "Was anyone with you?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10200": "I wish we could see the Lake from our common room. And was she beautiful?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10201": "Mm, Selkies have nasty teeth. That's what I've heard. Were you afraid?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10202": "Did you feel that it – the mermaid – was trying to communicate with you?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10203": "Really! What do you think it – she – was trying to say?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10204": "Astounding. Got any Pepper Imps?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10300": "I didn't hear anything.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10301": "Speaking of Peeves, I heard he drenched that poor boy again. You know the one. Hufflepuff. Winks a lot.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10302": "What do you mean? Like what?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10303": "You wouldn't catch me keeping one.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10304": "I'm sure lots of people are happy to write their every thought down on paper and have someone find it!",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10305": "I'm not sure I care what I did in the past. Shouldn't I perhaps be writing down what I hope to do in the future?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10306": "– instead of what we have or haven't already achieved.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10307": "I might even do that too. Yes. I think I shall. And I believe there would be more power in not telling anyone.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10308": "I believe there's a power in secrecy. It's its own form of magic.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10309": "You're entitled to your opinion. Doesn't mean I'm obliged to agree.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10310": "That's what I'm saying. My grandmother says that you only have so many heartbeats in your lifetime. Same thing.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10311": "Yes. She says you only have so many heartbeats and only so much room in your head, and when it's full it's full.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10312": "You can mock, but when you wake up one day in his class and can't remember your name, you'll be sorry.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10313": "Suppose you haven't been counting your heartbeats either?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10314": "Can you remember the date Binns said Emeric the Evil was slaughtered?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10315": "Oh dear.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10316": "I'm afraid it might be.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10317": "Owe me? What for?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10318": "Why don't you go and see Nurse Blainey?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10319": "Topping it up with what?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10320": "I'm afraid I'm going to have to disagree with you on this one. Nurse Blainey would never do anything like that.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10321": "And did it help?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10322": "What about the Shrivelfigs?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10323": "When are you going to try it then?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10324": "Are we likely to feel miserable afterwards?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10325": "No, but I mean afterwards. Won't we feel some degree of magnified sadness after being so – euphoric?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10326": "Better, I'd imagine!",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10327": "Well, I for one can't wait to tap into this wonderful joyfulness. I suspect it'll bring us closer as friends too.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10328": "I'd rather go alone.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10329": "I suppose there are some advantages to not going to a dance on your own.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10330": "An obvious one would be that you know you'll have a dance partner.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10331": "I don't believe so. I think he was simply presenting how one might feel. Or specifically how he might feel.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10332": "What? What's settled?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10333": "I think he was hungry.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10334": "Balthazar loves me. I'm his best friend.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10335": "But I've had him since he was tiny. He doesn't know anyone else. I'm his friend.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10336": "As I said, he must've been hungry. And I might've forgot to leave him some pellets.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10337": "No. Balthazar did nothing wrong. It was completely my fault. And now I just want you all to stop talking about it.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10338": "No he wasn't! I – would imagine.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10339": "Pfft, no. Of course not. I told you. It was Balthazar.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10340": "Yes. Precisely.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10341": "Third.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10342": "I hope you know that it isn't true.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10343": "I swear. She was only itchy because of a Stinging Jinx that the other girl put on her. It was not a bite from a flea.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10344": "And you should've seen her face. It was horrific!",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10345": "Thank you. Glad someone finally believes me.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10346": "What? Oh, nothing. Scratched myself with a quill.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10347": " Well just don't tell anyone, will you? He got them from one of Howin's Kneazles, I'm sure of it.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10348": "Not on your life.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10349": "All too well.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10350": "It was a spontaneous outing. We had intended to study, but then I really fancied something sweet.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10351": "Oh. We did get you a Cauldron Cake.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10352": "Goodness. I didn't know that was even possible.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10353": "Oh. What was that called?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10354": "Ah. Mm, yes. Very clear then, what to expect with that one.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10355": "What sort of wood was it? On the walls?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale2_10356": "No reason really. Just trying to get the image of entrails out of my head.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale3_10000": "Hand what back, sir? We’ve not took a thing!",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale3_10001": "I swear it was just those ones, sir!",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale3_10002": "That was a bit harsh.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale3_10003": "It's George! I'm sure of it!",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale3_10004": "That! That is George!",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale3_10005": "He was trying to become an Animagus – and we were in a field – full of sheep!",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale3_10006": "No! It's George!",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale3_10007": "What? Er –",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale3_10008": "A what moth?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale3_10009": "All I know is he said, 'A Tomato Animagus'.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale3_10010": "Oh George! I know his voice.",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale3_10011": "George, stop it! Look! – he knows his name!",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale3_10012": "George?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale3_10013": "I was sure it was you!",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale4_10000": "Argh!",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale4_10001": "Oh, not again -",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale4_10002": "Please, Peeves – you'll make me late!",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale4_10003": " I'll get you for this!",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale7_10000": "What you doing with a sheep? You can't bring a sheep into school?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale7_10001": "I look nothing like a sheep?",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale7_10002": "Why did you buy me a second pair? I hate these socks!",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale7_10003": "I'd rather have no socks than be dancing like this!",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale7_10004": "See? And you'd said the charm'd come out in the wash, but it hasn't!",
  "T3StudentHufflepuffMale7_10005": "Urgh! Oh please can't we take these socks back to Mr Hill and get me some normal ones?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10000": "I was not.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10001": "Not!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10002": "I was looking out the window. That's all – I swear.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10003": "I – why are you pressing me? You're the one who's scrawled Isaac Cooper all over your notebook.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10004": "It's true! I saw your Herbology notes. You have his name written all around your drawing of a Devil's Snare.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10005": "Why aren't you asking me to draw your Devil's Snare? What's wrong with mine?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10006": " I'm an excellent drawer.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10007": "You're just both jealous because Everett Clopton's sweet on me. ",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10008": "I admire someone with a brilliant mind.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10009": "Oh, shut up.  Honestly.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10010": "Everett never gets detention.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10011": "Well – that and the fact that he's simply divine.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10012": "Stop. I have no concern of who he sits next to.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10013": "Oh, the pair of you are simply impossible. Anyone can sit next to me, any time they so desire.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10014": "Tell him what?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10015": "I shall absolutely Obliviate you if you ever do such a thing. Or send you to the hospital wing.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10016": "(gasp) You'll do no such thing.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10017": "Oh – please don't do that.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10018": "I prefer interesting conversation than someone trying to slay a Horntail.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10019": "My point, as I was trying to make, is that it's nice to simply talk to someone; get to know them a little.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10020": "Oh, stop it. If I hear one more reference to Everett Clopton, I shall simply –",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10021": "You are incorrigible. But, if you must know – yes.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10022": "I'm a little bit interested.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10023": "Would there be love potions do you think?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10032": "Liar. I know you're lying! Aren't you! You're making it all up.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10033": "But he is, isn't he. He's making it all up, all of it, nonsense.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10034": "Oh, I absolutely hate you. I hate you.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10035": " So he did say something about me!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10036": "I cannot believe how much I hate you. You'd better watch yourself next time I'm near a Mandrake.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10037": "What? Just the sound of those girls nattering is enough to put you off your studies altogether.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10038": "Making a bit of a fuss? You wouldn't be saying that if it was disrupting Beasts.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10039": "Yes. That'll show them. The library's a place for serious studies. Not frantic, juvenile whispering.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10040": "Point well taken.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10041": "We saw you. And I'm sure we weren't the only ones.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10042": "Balthazar! You're truly the silliest person I know.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10043": "He's marvellous at Astronomy. One day I'll get up the nerve to ask him to show me his favourite star.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10044": "I bet it is.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10045": "Oh, no. Of course no one cares about how good you are.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10046": "You're only saying that because you're not very good at it.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10047": "Well, since Quidditch is cancelled – what would be another way to get attention?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10048": "What? Sorry – what did you say?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10072": "If you can call rabbiting on about Ollivanders 'their best'?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10073": "I swear, if I hear 'My uncle was a Shacklebolt' one more time –",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10074": "Oh, don't be so dramatic.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10075": "It's their own fault.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10076": "They'd have done better to keep quiet about it. Keep people guessing, I say.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10077": "Shut up. Just shut up. You and your big mouth.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10078": "What do you mean?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10079": "How could there be? Everyone knows there are only so many sacred bloodlines, and we know them all.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10080": "Yes, I suppose you would. 'My name's Belinda and I'm a pure-blood.' 'Oh, yes. And what's your surname dear?'",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10081": "'Scarecrow. Belinda Scarecrow.'",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10082": "Oh? And pray tell what was it?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10083": "What?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10084": "'And then there was Potter, Gaunt, Longbottom, and finally Barnsandwich.' ",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10085": " Barnsandwich!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10086": "I believe you. And I'm sure you have a Hippogriff under your bed as well.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10087": "That, that's not funny. Don't try to be funny.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10088": "Yes. It was amusing. Just because I say something amusing doesn't mean you have to say something amusing.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10089": "Yes. Show us. Let's hear this Parseltongue.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10090": "Why not?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10091": "Snakes? Wanting to talk to you? You're not short of confidence, are you?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10109": "Some of it's boring but sometimes it's interesting.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10110": "Aah. That's sad",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10111": "No. That bit you said about the Crup. I love Crups.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10112": "Did your Crup die, then?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10113": "Oh. That's good then.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10114": "Shame about the Crup, though, isn't it?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10115": "I do think you're being a little harsh.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10116": "I'm fairly sure that's not true.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10117": "No, of course not.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10118": "You're taking hearsay and assuming it to be correct. And it's quite cruel hearsay if I'm to be honest.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10119": "Ah, well that makes more sense then, doesn't it?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10120": "And – have you ever actually had dinner with one?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10121": "Oh do stop going on about it. I don't know why you're making such a fuss.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10122": "That seems extremely harsh.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10123": "Oh! Did we come up with meringue?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10124": "That's absurd. Why would you let some old grievance interfere with eating a food that you love?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10125": "Oh! Did you have something nice to eat?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10126": "That's rubbish.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10127": "I despair. I absolutely despair.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10128": "Perhaps they were trying to impress someone?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10129": "People do surprising things when they're seeking the attention of others.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10130": "Stop it! And don't be so silly!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10131": "You're both completely devious. For all you know they were simply carrying it for someone else.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10132": "Oh stop it. You're deluded moonminds, the both of you. Besides. the Wind Wisp'll beat a Yew Weaver any day.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10133": " Mine too. 'Every single one of them, broken in the first World Cup.'",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10134": "What? That we both have fathers obsessed with Quidditch fouls?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10135": "In the first World Cup?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10136": "For goodness's sake don't let my father know; I'll be collecting cobwebs at the Ministry before he shuts up about it.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10137": "Yes. Department of Magical Games and Sports. Feels a natural path for me.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10138": "What do you mean?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10139": " I promise I'll remember you. You remember that next time I ask for help in Transfiguration.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10140": "The Quidditch Cup? That's rather confident for someone who fell off their broom last week in Flying.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10141": "Nor me. I'd say the closest you'll come to the Quidditch Cup is polishing it.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10142": "Not saying you don't stand a chance at the House Cup of course.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10143": "That doesn't sound very sporting.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10144": "That's easy to say since now you won't have the chance to play Slytherin.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10145": "Well – it depends how serious the injury was.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10146": "Why? What on earth difference does it make?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10147": "Now you're the one being absurd.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10148": "Bit extreme, don't you think?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10149": "Oh! I know! What if – oh. Never mind, it wasn't a good idea.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10150": "What if they all got stuck in a goal hoop?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10151": "Or one that's too full.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10152": "That was my point exactly. A heavy stomach is not an advantage in a game.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10153": "Oh, I thought you'd finished. Please, carry on.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10154": "Your stomach rumbles!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10155": "When you've had too much cake and there's the Snitch, and the Bludger and – what you were saying.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10156": "Oh, did I interrupt again? Please, carry on. Go on, then.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10157": "The broom snaps.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10158": "It's true. It's a wonder she's not claiming the Muggle Prime Minister's her relative.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10159": "Pfft. Let alone claim they're related to the person who invented it. No. I'm afraid she's a proper little liar.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10160": "I know a little about Muggle sports.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10161": "But I don't know who invented cricket.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10162": "Oh! That makes three of us!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10163": "Bet you don't know who invented cricket. Personally, I think there's a chance it was her uncle.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10164": "I'm shocked the Ministry allowed it.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10165": "Aah, how can you not like a centaur? Majestic creatures, centaurs.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10166": "What are you hoping for? That Black goes to Azkaban?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10167": "Such heroics on the field run in my family. I have a distant ancestor in a book: The Noble Sport of Warlocks.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10168": "Oh? Very nice.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10169": "Or both. I used to enjoy a good romp about the field before Black cancelled everything. Grand fun, Quidditch.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10170": "But then I'd be just as enthralled to be in the library. Especially if Scribner's in a good mood.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10171": "Oh? Did she come up with a good Healing Potion then?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10172": "Oh? Work, did it?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10173": "Oh. Very nice.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10174": "It's all she talks about though.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10175": "It's a shame she doesn't Wigtown Wander off!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10176": "Yes. And I only know this because she will not shut up about them. I simply can't stand it.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10177": "Yes. Walter Parkin his name was, the father. ",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10178": "And an emblem of a silver butcher's knife on the chest. What a morbid spirit to bring to the field.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10179": "She'll be at it tomorrow no doubt. Right after Potions she starts up.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10180": "Still. I suppose it is a bit interesting.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10181": "However they would have managed before, I don't know.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10182": "Oh yes, I forgot about the strap.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10183": "Ha. I bet the players used to moan about it at first.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10184": "It's the same with any new invention isn't it. People grumble. People don't like change.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10185": "Some perhaps. But I'd bet most were staunchly opposed to the use of 'new charms'.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10186": "Likely caused quite a stir. I'd have liked to have been a fly on a goal hoop in 1875.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10187": "Yes! I'd be game for that!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10188": "When Black stops being such a miserable sod, then we'll try it! And I bet it's bloody fantastic!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10189": "If I grow up to be a professor I think I'd like to be like Garlick.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10190": "Yes. That's how kind she is. I'm sure it was only a few years ago that she was having a crafty Sugar Quill in class.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10191": "I don't think so, no.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10192": "I'm sure he's qualified in something. Likely something so clever they don't even teach it, because it's so hard.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10193": "Oh stop. I'm simply saying that there must be some skills one needs to become Headmaster.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10194": "Well, I shan't dwell on such things. Not when there's my beloved professor Garlick to think about.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10195": "That's part of it. But I like everything about her. I think she's beautiful.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10196": "Yes, that was ages ago. That was when I had my carriage ride with Adelaide Oakes in Hogsmeade.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10197": "She told on me for eating Sugar Quills in Beasts. We haven't spoken since.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10198": "What?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10199": "But I already told my best friend. Now she'll think I'm a fibber.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10200": "An experiment? In what? How to humiliate us?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10201": "Yes, well, you would've. Had it been true.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10202": "That's not the same at all.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10203": "And instead, she's going to think I'm a great big fibber. And if there's something I am, it's truthful.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10204": "What?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10205": "Oh, you, I was, I don't know why I said that. You're definitely my best friend.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10206": "Absolutely.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10207": "Oh? Is it your birthday?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10208": "You didn't, did you? Get them all right?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10209": "You must have come top of the class.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10210": "That's rubbish. How can you be a wizard and not be good at Charms?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10211": "What a surprise.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10212": "Oh. I could teach you Aguamenti if that would be helpful?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10213": "And you only have to eat five Acid Pops.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10214": "Think of the knowledge to be gained. There could be curses we've never even heard of!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10215": "I bet there's some incredible curses we could be using on first-years.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10216": "What do you mean? You're not being caring again are you?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10217": "Ugh, you're so boring. I hope your spurning of torment doesn't include Pepper Imps.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10218": "Well of course I knew that. Obviously. Urgh.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10219": "Convenience, for one. Not all of us are happy to skive off our studies to visit a joke shop.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10220": "And what if one hasn't enough pocket money for said Nose-Biting Teacups?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10221": "It is a hard decision that. Depends how much bathing might be involved.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10222": "They didn't!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10223": "And what about your mother? Was she livid?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10224": "As if you'd dare aim that thing at us.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10225": "That's mean. Funny, but mean.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10226": "What do you mean, 'all the hair.'?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10227": "He's right. I've heard it used in Zygmunt Budge's variations of Laughing Potion. Handfuls of the stuff.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10228": "You know it was Peeves.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10229": "As if I'm going to put Flobberworm Mucus on the eyepiece of a telescope. It was obviously Peeves.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10230": "Very good idea. Wish I'd thought of it.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10231": "Oh. leave her alone.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10232": "What, you're going to get yourself in trouble with Shah just to be a room with Amit?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10233": "Oh yes true. Well worth it.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10234": "It was only a Trip Jinx.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10235": "Oh please. If you bring up that blasted statute one more time –",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10236": "What, tripping up Muggles? I don't think so. More like Muggles burning us at the stake. At least do your research.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10237": "I should think we could play tricks on them till the end of eternity and still not end up even.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10238": "Of course I have a point. Can't even let loose a Bowtruckle without getting in trouble, thanks to that blasted clause.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10239": "Yes, know-it-all. We know you're a Muggle-lover.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10240": "Yes, but it was funny though, wasn't it! Seeing her jam tarts roll all about the floor like hatched ducklings.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10241": "That's absurd. Cruel is causing someone pain. Or tormenting them. Bullying is cruel. Hiding cakes is fun.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10242": "Why?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10243": "Well tell people not to eat them so quickly. Then you can have a sneaky practise of a Disillusionment Charm.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10244": "What? A Disillusionment Charm? I don't think so.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10245": "What?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10246": "As a matter of fact I can say for certain because I've done it on cakes that I've made.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10247": "What?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10248": "What an atrociously Muggle thing to say. I'm honestly not sure how to respond.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10249": "You're incredibly rude, even for a Slytherin. I don't recall seeing you turn down my cakes last time I made them?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10250": "I shall remember that.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10260": "I should say a Binns class fills up your brain.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10261": "I reckon the rate Binns is going we'll all be out of memory before our hearts give out.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10262": "Might be true. I'd rather remember what my Crup looks like that what year a goblin lost his coat button.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10263": "What would be the point in counting them? Unless you knew the final number?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10264": "What? Is it too late for him? Is his brain – full?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10265": "And you also went on to do the exact same thing.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10266": "Well I'd appreciate it not happening again.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10267": "Not anyone. Anyone at all.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10268": "Oh. Well, thank you.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10269": "Well, I have been told I have some talent as an artist.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10270": "No need to sound so shocked.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10271": "Yes. Most likely. And the one I pasted on the Quidditch stand.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10272": "You said it was a good drawing a mere moment ago!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10273": "Well, I shan't be drawing your double-ended newt next time you ask.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10274": "Yes. I stuck one on the chalkboard when I was in detention.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10282": "But if I said it was for an essay for History of Magic, how could she refuse?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10283": "Yes I think we get it. It's just that I heard that fourth-year saying she'd had a peek in there the other day –",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10284": "No not that one. Her friend.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10285": "If I could just have a good reason to look in the Restricted Section. Just a look. Not even to take a book out.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10286": "The signature of someone famous on a book, I don't know. Perhaps I just want to go where I'm not allowed.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10287": "I suppose I'd never thought about it until now. But yes, I think you might be onto something.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10288": "Why? I still want to go in there. Your great revelation hasn't changed that.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10289": "She was humming again.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10290": "Of course I was bothered.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10291": "It's enough trying to memorise dates for Binns without being pounded by a horrid tune that Peeves likely made up.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10292": "Well I for one would appreciate people simply behaving in an orderly manner. Without humming. Or winking.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10293": "I have a younger sister who looks up to me. I can't be going home for holidays without something for her to aspire to.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10294": "Some sort of, I don't know, special recognition. An 'exemplary student' and all that.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10295": "I'm not so sure. Last time I was home she'd left a Horklump in my bed. Can't say that's a sign of respect.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10296": "Really? Oh gosh. That would be very much appreciated. I'm not one for confrontations. Thank you.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10297": "Oh, of course. Wouldn't expect you to. Unless you could perhaps teach him a better tune?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10298": "Understood. Understood.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10299": "Why not? I think it's nice to be able to look back on old diaries and see what you were doing in the past.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10300": "There. See, I'm not the only one.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10301": "Oh well of course you keep it in a safe place. Somewhere secret where no one would look. And you don't tell anyone.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10302": "In my trunk.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10303": "Hmph. What an interesting idea.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10304": "I think it's a fine idea. In fact tonight I shall make a list in my diary, of things I hope to achieve, in the future.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10305": "My personal and private ambitions.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10306": "Not telling people what you're writing down? What your ambitions actually are?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10307": "It shall be done tonight. The ink will be dry before my head touches the pillow. And I shan't tell a soul.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10308": "Oh yes, of course.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10309": "More like he doesn't like you.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10310": "Well how is it you had a bloody nose from this supposedly adoring Puffskein?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10311": "Oh, well no wonder he went at you like Doxys to Billywigs. Poor thing must've been starving.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10312": "No. What happened?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10313": "I see. Because of course we all know that if you were in a scuffle, they'd never stand a chance.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10314": " What year was he in? The boy who hit him?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10315": "It doesn't matter.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10316": "I simply said that it was unusual for a Ravenclaw to have such little wit. Nothing offensive at all.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10317": "No. I shall answer your question.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10318": "I caught her outside the boys' lavatory singing a song with Peeves.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10319": "Marvellous. I shall see you both outside the boys' toilets for a recital.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10320": "Even more marvellous. That's it, decided. I shall align myself with Slytherin.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10321": "Of course it is.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10322": "Thank you.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10323": "What else were they supposed to do with it? It's a crow. I'm sure your parents would've done the same thing.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10324": "The harm? They say the bird's walking across their front path twenty times a day. They're at their wits' end.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10325": "You know very well that my mother is Muggle-born. She has different beliefs than us.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10326": "That's it's waiting for newly departed souls – to leave the house. She's afraid to step out the front door.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10327": "That's a good idea. I'll tell her that.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10328": "Oh she's far worse than Ronen.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10329": "Good. I'm sure they likely hadn't heard the house called, that's all.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10330": "Now why would you say that? Just to be cruel.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10331": "Would you stop revisiting every sliver of this incident? I mean, sorting.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10332": "Wh – but, why then? Why did no one clap when you were sorted?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10333": "Yes?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10334": "What?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10335": "We all do stupid things at one time or another. I bet you feel better after getting it off your chest.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale1_10336": "Is not.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10000": "You were too.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10001": "Swear on your life?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10002": " You little liar.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10003": "Because you're not a good drawer.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10004": "More lies.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10005": "You are such a moonmind  not to mention a proper little liar.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10006": "Well, I don't think it's clever at all.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10007": "Bragging about how you'd 'go into the forest any time'. Everyone knows how dangerous it is.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10008": "All I'm saying is why would anyone put themselves in harm's way when they can simply read about the forest in the library.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10009": "Wait. Is that why you never want me to sit next to you?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10010": "Well. I shall be sitting next you and that will sort this whole thing.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10011": "What if he's not making it up?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10012": "That is rather cruel and unusual punishment, I must say. I might hate you too.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10013": "It was a ridiculous thing to do. I'm not impressed in the least.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10014": "No one's making a fuss. That's just it. It's not fuss-worthy.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10015": "No one cares that you took a Puffskein into the library.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10016": "Who's making a fuss? I'm not making a fuss.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10017": "I once snuck into the boys' lavatory.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10018": "Oh, I didn't think. Very sorry. I promise to let you know next time.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10019": "Surely it must be Venus?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10020": "But we're lucky we get to use brooms. Muggles can't do that.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10021": "Well, we know what to buy you for your birthday.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10027": "Nothing worse than one of them desperately trying to draw attention to the good half of their blood.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10028": "Ugh. 'My neighbour was a Yaxley.' 'My father's best friend was a Flint.' It's beyond pathetic.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10029": "Yes, you sound worse than a pauper. 'I've only crumbs to eat.'",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10030": "The only reason anyone even knows they're a half-blood is because they keep claiming some vague allegiance to a pure wizarding bloodline.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10031": "Don't let your secrets out. Like you. You keep that well under your hat.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10032": "I think it's always boring.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10033": "I suppose you're right. The thing is, it's all in the past now. I'm not sure why we have to keep learning about it.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10034": "Why? Why do we need to keep it alive? If it's old and stuffy and boring, why can't we simply let it die, like an old Crup?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10035": "What? Letting tradition die off to make way for new and more practical activities?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10036": "What? N – No. No. I've not owned a Crup.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10037": "Well, now you're being silly. Obviously we need to be sorted by the Sorting Hat.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10038": "I think I should be quite interested to have dinner with a Muggle.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10039": "I think what she means is that, perhaps it's a rumour you've heard. And we all know how much stock to put in those.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10040": "What sort of place was it anyway? The place that the Muggles lived in?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10041": "A farm? With pigs? Well, of course there's going to be some muck around.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10042": "What do you mean?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10043": "Oh! Perhaps collecting them. Someone has to go around gathering all the things that go into our potions.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10044": "Crouch?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10045": "Potter. Hm. I quite like it myself. Perhaps they'll surprise us yet, and do something – amazing.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10046": "So you say.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10047": "You, perhaps?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10048": "Yes, exactly. If it were true that you were almost flattened by a Streeler, that could be construed as bravery.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10049": "Oh, would you?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10050": "They say the person matched exactly your description.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10051": "Aha. So, you confess.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10052": "Oh, goodness, this is exciting. Now, let's see. What other rumours can we start?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10053": "I've never really thought about it.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10054": "Well? Go on, then. What is this grand theory of yours that Muggle-borns have it better than us?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10055": "He has a point. What about that?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10056": "A Murtlap? My parents never turned me into a Murtlap.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10057": "Awful example.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10058": "Don't be too mean to him. It's not his fault he's not a Muggle-born.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10059": "I'd be thrilled if one of them asked me.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10060": "Oh, but it wouldn't be the same.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10061": " Oh, the mere thought of it; makes me feel as if I've been stung by a Billywig.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10062": "Oh, the thought!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10063": "Well, for starters, you'd know he truly loved you because he'd have to work hard to keep a nice home.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10064": "I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10065": "Ahhh. You see?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10066": "A Muggle boy would never say that.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10067": "Don't trust him. He only tries to get everyone injured because he likes having a chat with Nurse Blainey.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10068": "I think I'd have to agree there. Did anything else get bitten by the enchanted bee? What about your nose?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10069": "A buzzing nose would have been good.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10070": "No. The buzzing elbow, it's a bit bland really.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10071": "Well you could be – mortally wounded?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10072": "We didn't mean to offend you.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10073": "That's all. Nothing offensive. Just know, if something untoward should happen, we'll be there to make fun of you.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10074": "Hard to believe though, isn't it?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10075": "No. That there are seven hundred ways to foul.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10076": "Mmm, you're right. Perhaps they cheated and used Protection Charms?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10077": "(giggling)",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10078": "I'd say so.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10079": "I think it's more than a big decision.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10080": "Enormous. Can't imagine anything bigger.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10081": "How old should a shopkeeper be?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10082": "Why can't a shopkeeper be young?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10083": "But why does he have to? Do you see my point? We all have to start somewhere – with no experience.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10084": "Isn't it just, 'eat until you're full.'? Does it have to be such a scientific calculation?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10085": "Oh that's not good is it.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10086": "Oh, what a shame. And all because you ate too many Cauldron Cakes.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10087": "A conversation with a Jarvey? You'll want a good meal for that.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10088": "We could be expelled.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10089": "If you ask me, nothing is worth disobeying our headmaster's specific orders.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10090": "Yes. Finish this apparently 'non-absurd' idea to bring about a revolt in the school.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10091": " Yes? Then what?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10092": "I for one am not going to risk my entire wizarding career upon nothing less than a mutiny.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10093": "I would say the fact that he's our headmaster is all the right that he needs.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10094": "And not everyone hates him. Only most people.  No – I suppose everyone does hate him.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10095": "Shall we just get a Butterbeer tomorrow then?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10096": "I completely agree with you. I would have never had only one.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10097": "Oh don't be such a sulk. I also think the idea of one Seeker is due for revision. Let's face it: the game's too hard.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10098": "It's true. There must've been soil falling all over the spectators.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10099": "I once read that a Chaser in the Middle Ages had a bird's nest fall out – right in his face apparently. Shame.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10100": "No. No I don't think so.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10101": "Why are you talking about birds' eggs? I said, I don't think there were eggs in the nest. Stop talking about birds' eggs.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10102": "Yes I know what sort of eggs, I – I had only meant it was a shame the Chaser was distracted.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10103": "Eh – never mind. Let's all simply accept that a Quidditch team has one Seeker.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10104": "That's remarkable. Our neighbour once got a mention in the <i>Daily Prophet</i> for a tea that was good for boils.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10105": "Oh! Our neighbour once got a mention in a book that's in the library. One about Healing Potions.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10106": "No. She fell over and got ever such a scrape – so they tested one out on her. A Healing Potion.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10107": "No. Very septic it went. She had to go to St Mungo's but she was so pleased to get a mention in that book.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10108": "It's enough to send you to the infirmary just listening to her.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10109": "She'll send me to an early grave. They'll have to write on my tombstone, 'Heard too much about the Wigtown Wanderers'.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10110": "I swear I never want to hear another word about them as long as I live. And what about the uniforms?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10111": "Fascinating. Truly fascinating.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10112": "Lucky he didn't hit you.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10113": "Ooh! What would that move be called?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10114": "I'm not sure I want to encourage this.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10115": "Yes but that was before I saw Astoria Cricket almost get detention when Professor Howin tripped up.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10116": "Sharp's a horrid choice. We might hurt him more than he already is.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10117": "Well I don't want to have anything to do with it. It's enough that I won't tell on you both.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10118": "Yes. And I felt awful afterwards. I can't even look Kogawa in the eye.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10119": "Oh yes of course.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10120": "You made up – the whole story?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10121": "Her best friend thinks that the next time we have soup there's going to be frogs. Lots and lots of frogs. Tiny frogs!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10122": "By the way,  why aren't I your best friend?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10123": "You spend more time with me than you do her. Why aren't I your best friend?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10124": "Really? Do you really mean that?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10125": "I heard you with my own ears!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10126": "I've heard Mandrakes quieter than you. It's a wonder Garlick didn't stick you in a pot!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10127": "And not one tethered by a Ramora. More like a Jarvey.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10128": "We'll have to let Garlick know how sensitive you are. Mind you don't encounter any Stinksap.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10129": "A Hebridean Black then. The point is, you told him his homework was had by a dragon.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10130": "I wonder if I could tell Howin that's what happened to my homework?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10131": "How so? What do you mean?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10132": "Yes, like how the Common Welsh Green has fire that bursts out in thin jets.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10133": "Oh, yes. I see. Yes, very true about the melodious roar. But for this task, no, that's definitely wrong.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10134": "I suppose you could always enchant a normal one.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10135": "Yes. One you already have. In your kitchen.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10136": "Well in that instance I'd suggest Zonko's.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10137": "Well I just use his.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10138": "I was impressed by how fast you did it but that's about it.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10139": "That's a relief, because it certainly didn't impress me.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10140": "What?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10141": "No, no. He has a point. It was swift. That much I can give you. A quick hex.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10142": "I did like the canary bit.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10143": "When he ate the fruit pie you'd hexed and he turned into a canary. I did like that bit.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10144": "Mm. I was disappointed about the moult though. Thought there'd be much more plumage. Feathers.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10145": "I think it'd be most appropriate.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10146": "Yes. It's called language. Were you Confunded recently?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10147": "Not that one who pretends she can't hear?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10148": "Sounds like the second-year's the one with the future as a potioneer. The uncle'd better watch out.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10149": "And just to be clear, we're not talking about the one who pretends she can't hear.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10150": "How do I know it wasn't you?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10151": "Good idea though, isn't it?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10152": "Why would you do that?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10153": "I would never get Amit in trouble.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10154": "Unless of course we were in detention together.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10155": "You did with Everett Clopton.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10156": "Yes but it still didn't feel – right.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10157": "She's right. The entire Statute of Secrecy was brought about for this very reason.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10158": "Mm. I suppose you do have a point.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10159": "What, Clause 73?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10160": "It was funny, I can't lie.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10161": "My idea's much better.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10162": "That wasn't its permanent name.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10163": "Yes.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10164": "No.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10165": "Yes, we'll come with you.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10166": "Are you sure? Nurse Blainey is highly regarded. I can't see her doing anything – untoward.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10167": "What are you getting at? Go on. Spit it out.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10168": "What were you in for anyway? When you saw Nurse Blainey last time?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10169": "Yet, simply because you saw her spill a bit of Skele-Gro on the floor, you're afraid to go back?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10170": "And why on earth would you think that?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10171": "I wouldn't think Black would mind someone telling on someone. Seems it'd be his cup of tea.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10172": "It was a good drawing though. Made me laugh.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10173": "Were they saying that based on your illustration of Black? The one you stuck underneath the sink in the lavatory?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10174": "Hmph. How – peculiar.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10175": "Yes I know. Thought you did a good job of his beard, that's all. But nothing that would warrant use of the word – artist.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10176": "Oh don't be like that. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. Besides, isn't there still a third one of your creations about?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10177": "Couldn't agree more. Not to mention, it exposes us to their backward way of thinking.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10178": "Yes. And how they shouldn't be allowed at Hogwarts.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10179": "Completely barbaric.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10180": "Pfft. How absurd. As if anyone hailing from a Muggle could write the first thing about magic. The sheer audacity.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10181": "Oh hmm.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10182": "Suppose I don't mind the odd Cornish pasty. Seen some unusual cats in that region too.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10183": "I should hope not. They can't be trusted. Except with Cornish pasties I suppose.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10184": "Shan't be going there again.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10185": "Hmph. Do you think they'd have one for the pasty?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10186": "I'd never fold down a corner in a book. I'd make a fuss too if I were her.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10187": "Oh I think she goes about repairing them when we're not about. If you look you'll see there actually aren't many.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10188": "What? What's a fun game?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10189": "Oh that does sound rather fun.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10190": "What? What on earth makes you say that?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10191": "We're looking for folded pages, not ferrets.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10192": "Oh? What's that?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10193": "I keep a diary.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10194": "Where do you keep yours?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10195": "Oh me too.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10196": "Yes that is rather intriguing. We would write what we aspire to do –",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10197": "Oh, you'll still tell me won't you?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10198": "She did say that.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10199": "Well of course you're going to say that.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10200": "She did say it was quite fierce. Which doesn't sound too much like a flea bite.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10201": "Well then. It's clear the girl was mistaken and your Puffskein is innocent. Or should I say – clean.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10202": "I had mentioned.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10203": "Yes. And to see Sirona.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10204": "Monster.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10205": "It matters to me.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10206": "I should say one who doesn't find that offensive is clearly lacking intelligence. Also unusual for a Ravenclaw.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10207": "Ugh, she'll never apologise so let's please put the matter behind us.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10208": "N – no. Perhaps don't. Please?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10209": "(sigh)",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10210": "I – what if I did? Peeves has wit. Lots of it. Besides, this is none of anyone's business. I like singing.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10211": "She's right.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10212": "Yes. I'm sure they didn't expect it to become – tame.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10213": "Dreadful.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10214": "Awful.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10215": "Oh, that wouldn't be good.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10216": "What?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10217": "I am not. I'm simply feeling sorry for the crow.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10218": "I think I'll miss you.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10219": "Oh stop. I'm trying to be serious for once.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10220": "I might even miss you.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10221": "Crupmite.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10222": "Well. I know it's not something we need to prepare for just yet –",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10223": "No! For goodness' sake, I take it back. I shan't miss you.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10224": "I simply wanted you to know, both of you, but mainly you – that it's been an honour to be your friend.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10225": "No! And that wherever our paths may lead – I shan't forget you. Both of you. But especially you.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10226": "(giggling)",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale2_10227": "Ha! Brilliant.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale3_10000": "Urgh! If Black hadn't cancelled it, we wouldn't be looking for the blasted thing in the first place!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale3_10001": "You're saying it wrong! Urgh! Re-vea-lio!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale3_10002": "Oh shut up. Wait - <i>Accio!</i>",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale3_10003": "(effort)",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale3_10004": "He's ruined my entire school year! I hope a Puffskein goes up his nose and snatches his brain.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale3_10005": "What sort of headmaster doesn't allow sports? Deserves to be in Azkaban. That'd suit him.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale3_10006": "Truer words were never spoken.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale4_10000": "- and then the werewolves joined the goblins in the uprising -",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale4_10001": "- and by the end of it the Minister for Magic was Albert Boot.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale4_10002": "I’m not telling lies, Peeves. It was Albert Boot.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale4_10003": "If only.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale4_10004": "Get away!  All of you!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale4_10005": "No!  And none of your business!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale4_10006": "I know –",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale4_10007": "Yes!  I mean - shut up!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale4_10008": "What, me?  Use a broom? Not to fly?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale4_10009": "Urgh!  Feel like a Muggle.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawFemale4_10010": "Oh shut up.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10000": "I'm still waiting for the reason you think a unicorn is a bad idea.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10001": "I would say the fuss is about if a Muggle had seen you.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10002": "Well, you'd be in big trouble with the Ministry if anyone saw you.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10003": "Oh, Merlin's beard, if someone does a pun I'm leaving.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10004": "You'd be serious if you had someone in your common room practising the Body-Bind Curse on you every night.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10005": "It's all right. It's giving me the motivation I need to practise <i>Protego</i>. It's quite rewarding.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10006": "That doesn't even make any sense. You do know that?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10007": "It's true. I bet your closet's brimming with the best Gladrags has to offer.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10008": "Er – since everyone's basically becoming one of your wards, I wouldn't mind a refresher myself.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10009": "I'd imagine it could be quite useful to have a Bowtruckle stashed under one's bed.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10010": "Mm, perhaps not so useful after all. Last thing I need are detentions.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10011": "I think it would make people uncomfortable.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10012": "Fantastic for finding yourself in Black's office.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10013": "Well, how very courteous of you.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10014": "Oh? What sort of beasts?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10015": "Yes, I remember Howin mentioned it one time. I've never seen one though.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10016": "Yes, I think so too. He once spent an hour telling me all about Jamaica. Quite the life he's had.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10017": "Well, thank you very much. I shall remember that next time you ask to borrow Sites of Historical Sorcery.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10018": "Ah you should've stuck it out to chapter three; goblin rebellions of the eighteenth century – riveting.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10019": "Ugh – quite the charmer, aren't you.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10020": "Oh, even I get a bit faint trying to understand that one.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10021": "You're making an excuse for him.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10022": "Oof, right to my heart.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10023": "Need I say more.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10024": "That is unnecessarily cruel.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10025": "What is this? Some sort of ambush? The lot of you sound like you've been put under the Imperius Curse by Black.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10026": "Well – I see. Well, it's good I have my sharp wits then, isn't it?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10027": "Ugh, good grief, this is worse than I'd thought.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10028": "I can't. I don't think it's even physically possible to be suffocated by a Puffskein.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10029": "I'm not sure a dream about Puffskeins constitutes a nightmare – ?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10030": "Thank goodness.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10031": "Sure you don't mean – 'tickling'?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10032": "More like someone to remove the Confundus Charm.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10033": "What? Your homework?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10034": "Oh. Oh, I see. Not up for speculation then, is it.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10035": "I'll say. I'd be keeping quiet about that if I were you.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10036": "I got a 'moderately sufficient'.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10037": "At least he focuses on schooling the mind rather than turning us all into barbarians.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10038": "We're questioning whether that first-year was fibbing when they said their grandparents were pure-bloods.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10039": "I suppose he has a point.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10040": "I'm simply saying, we could all make up stories about our relatives, couldn't we.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10041": "What?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10042": "You could be making that up.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10043": "And I'm saying. What if you're fibbing that your grandfather's a plumber?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10044": "He could be.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10045": "Tricky thing, septic tanks.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10046": "That's ridiculous.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10047": "You're not being serious are you? Not actually serious?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10048": "Don't you two understand that by your mere pondering of what Muggles might be like, you're fostering – untruths.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10049": "But that's just it. You never have actual facts. Just last week it was, 'Muggles go blind on Sundays.' And I –",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10050": "– I don't think that's true.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10051": "But heard it from where? What source?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10052": "Wait till the day comes where people are making up things about you. Then see how you like it.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10053": "Certainly she's the friendliest of the lot.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10054": "I think it just came up naturally. I don't think there was any sort of plot afoot.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10055": "Yes, she mentioned it a while ago. When that Mandrake went missing and they found it in the kitchen.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10056": "Oh, is this the thing about the Flobberworm Mucus? Because he spilled some, in your inkwell?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10057": "What is it you're bothered about again?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10058": "Oh I see.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10059": "Sounds rather serious. What did the person do to you, exactly?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10060": "Oh. Oh I see.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10061": "Oh. Oh I see. You're sweet on her then, are you? Astoria Crickett?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10062": "Anyway, what is this vile retribution that you seek?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10063": "To do what?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10064": "But a Diricawl doesn't fly. Oh, oh I see.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10065": "What isn't considered a foul? There are seven hundred of them.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10066": "Is the revenge off then?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10067": "Oh. I was looking forward to that.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10068": "I saw him catch himself in a mirror the other day. I swear he was there for half an hour.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10069": "Charming.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10070": "Not sure about that.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10071": "Only being honest.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10072": "The only class that man could teach is one in arrogance. ",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10073": "Yes I would agree. And I'm not one of them.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10074": "I rest my case.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10075": "Then there's definitely no hope for me. I'd rather listen to Binns than have to keep an eye on that blasted Snitch.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10076": "Mm, you're probably right. That girl could catch a Snitch with a Puffskein up her nose.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10077": "Don't answer that. I prefer to think that Imelda Reyes was born exceptional; then I don't feel so awfully lazy.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10078": "It's not as if there's really anywhere else to buy brooms nearby.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10079": "I don't wish to interfere with what is clearly a highly detailed operation – but, can't you simply wipe the thing?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10080": "(defeated sigh)",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10081": "Does it actually have any of this most sinister dust remaining on its 'broomly' corpus?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10082": "Tell you what, I ever open a broom shop, you're not coming through my doors.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10083": "Especially when you consider that he has to have them brought from all over. They're not all made locally.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10084": "Who? Albie Weekes? Hmph. Never thought about it. You might be right.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10085": "I concur. You exude confidence with your Silver Arrow. Till you get on the thing.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10086": "Let's hope when you get that Yew Weaver you'll stay on a bit longer.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10087": "Don't know about casting <i>Glacius</i> on your opponents' brooms; I should think you'd want to cast it at Black.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10088": "What, and get us all expelled?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10089": "I beg your pardon; we absolutely should not engage in such untoward coercion.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10090": "What? Bu – how is that fair? I should be punished for trying to save your backs from expulsion?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10091": "Scoundrels. The lot of you.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10092": "Of course they're not the same. Muggles have spindly legs. Like spiders. It's all the walking.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10093": "No. Because they don't go very far.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10094": "Ronen would likely turn the entire match into something theatrical.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10095": "Why did I hear you asking about pearl dust the other day then?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10096": "So we're to believe that you used no sort of Love Potion during these exchanges?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10097": "They're one of the best teams out there.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10098": "Yes. He told us this in confidence. That's rotten of you to threaten to tell.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10099": "I'm sure your father would've understood. Fear of heights isn't entirely uncommon.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10100": "Mm. Suppose not.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10101": "Yes. I once told my mother that I didn't actually enjoy her cabbage omelettes.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10102": "Awful. She made me scrub down every ornament in the garden. Happened on one that was a real gnome. Terrible.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10103": "Mm, I suppose that is a point.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10104": "Yes I told you: you're very clever!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10105": "Fine. A genius. Happy now?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10106": "I'm just trying to – Invisiblus! – no, that's not it, er – What if I do –",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10107": "Success! Haha, you're right! It's superb!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10108": "Abandoned potions of the Middle Ages as compared to the Black Plague?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale1_10109": "Oh. Well you'll do well on that one then.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10000": "I find the whole concept of hurling one's body around on a broom highly disturbing.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10001": "Truth be told, I'd be quite happy if I never had to sit on a broom again.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10002": "What? Oh, er hello – oh, very funny. Aren't we the jester. They should stick you in with the Jarveys.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10003": "Oh shut up. The both of you.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10004": "I agree. There's only so much one can take of 'dragon scale tales'.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10005": "That is completely correct. What's your point?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10006": "It does seem a little strange that only you were there at the time.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10007": "Perhaps you want people to think you're brave?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10008": "Well, that's very kind of you. I know I'm a bit of a lost cause on a broom.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10009": "You're very kind – both of you. Really though, I'm sure I'll be fine.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10010": "Well, I can't say no to you then, can I.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10011": "They'll never do it when the librarian's about though. You watch; they only start their chit-chat when she leaves.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10012": "Well, I think we should simply whip up a Tongue-Tying Curse the next time they get up to their whispering.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10013": "Hear that? She's not impressed in the least.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10014": "Hear that? She says it's not fuss-worthy.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10015": "Hear that? She –",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10016": "(sniff) No one's making a fuss. No one's impressed either.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10017": "She doesn't like me, and I don't blame her. I'm hopeless at flying.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10018": "Thanks for that.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10019": "I think so too. Especially if you're a really good flier.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10020": "Does anyone care how good I am with a telescope? Or is it only Clopton that warrants an assessment.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10021": "Charming.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10022": "Well, I for one am relieved Quidditch is cancelled.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10023": "What? What is?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10024": "Oh, not another one fawning all over Isaac Cooper. What is this school coming to?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10025": "Oh, I think I'm just going to go and get eaten by a Peruvian Vipertooth. Would either of you even notice? Anyone?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10026": "I think Muggles have it better, not having to fuss about with brooms.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10027": "No. But I'm just saying, it's a lot of pressure, flying. Not to mention the expense of buying a broom.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10028": "No. Of course not. I can admire them for riding horses can't I?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10029": "Oh, not a horse. Don't get me a horse. Or a broom.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10037": "You'd be rather unfortunate to have that bloodline, wouldn't you?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10038": "Well. To be in a bloodline that didn't quite make the cut.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10039": "Scarecrow.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10040": "Barnsandwich? Is your grandmother a moonmind?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10041": " Barnsandwich. That's a good one.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10042": " Barnsandwich.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10043": " Barnsandwich.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10044": "Since we're speaking on the matter, I didn't think there was much difference.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10045": "Yes, Merlin knows we'll not be able to live our lives without this great revelation.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10046": "Exactly. What about that?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10047": "What sort of parents turn a child into a Murtlap?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10048": "Abysmal. Try again. As of now my sympathies go to anyone who had the miserable lot of raising the likes of you.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10049": "No, I would imagine they don't since it's highly unlikely they even know the meaning of the word Murtlap!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10050": "Oh, not you as well? I give up. I literally give up.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10051": "Ugh. What for? To eat?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10052": "You can't be serious.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10053": "And what's that got to do with the price of tea? All the more reason to keep them well away.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10054": "Oh! Well! That's fine then, isn't it? I don't know why I was so worried. It only sucks your blood!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10055": "Ingenious? And what if one is besieged by these leeches and, oh, I don't know, bleeds to death?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10056": "A what-a-moagliant?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10057": "Oh well! Why didn't you say that in the first place? We're set then, aren't we?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10058": "If woe should befall us in the presence of a Muggle, we can know, at least we won't have a messy death.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10059": "They'll simply let us be tidily eaten alive by blood sucking slugs.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10060": "I despair. Whatever happened to good old-fashioned being eaten by vampires.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10061": "I think it's mostly interesting but sometimes boring.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10062": "Well, it's tradition, isn't it? That's the thing about tradition; you want to keep it alive.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10063": "But things wouldn't be the same without tradition. No one would have a sense of where they came from.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10064": "I'm sure a professor could arrange for us to be sorted; but it wouldn't be the same without the Sorting Hat, would it?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10065": "And you see? That's tradition. And you're clearly showing a preference for it. I feel I have proven my point.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10066": "They what-a-guinatate – ugh, never mind. Just never mind.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10067": "Yes, you are rather going on about it.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10068": "I'm not fully sure we came up with pancakes.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10069": "I hope so. I'd hate to be a traitor but I won't stop eating meringue.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10070": "Well, yes, I have all of those. Doesn't mean I'm willing to give up meringue.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10071": "Oh, why didn't you say? Last time I have one of those.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10072": "Oh, no no. Nothing like that. Just that, one time, my parents took me to Nice for a holiday –",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10073": "And some wood nymphs sang me a song for my birthday. Never been so embarrassed in my life.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10074": "Cornish pasty.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10075": "A person's surname does convey their blood status – if they're a pure-blood.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10076": "I'm not sure I see your point?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10077": "Go on.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10078": "Involved with slugs?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10079": "Goblin pure-bloods?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10080": "And this theory covers all wizarding bloodlines, does it? Greengrass?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10081": "And Potter? Crafting urns?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10082": "Now that would be impressive.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10083": "It's all anyone can talk about.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10084": "Not everyone is enthralled with flying through three little hoops while people scream like banshees.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10085": "I for one find it quite – unnerving.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10086": "No. It does none of that. Nothing of the sort. What it does give is a queasy tummy.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10087": "Precisely. It's simply too much. All that screaming, I can't hear myself think, let alone keep track of a tiny golden speck.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10088": "Fine. A Snitch, that looks like a speck let out of a balloon that can't keep a straight line if its life depended on it.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10089": "No I have not. Last game I played, the Snitch crashed into my pocket and I was dragged about like a Niffler's stash.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10090": "One of what? What do you mean?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10091": "Really? Never thought about it that way. Yes. You may be right. Ha! I think I'd make a rather good banshee!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10092": "I give up.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10093": "I can't say I'd be placing any wagers on Gryffindor.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10094": "No, it's not really, is it?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10095": "Yes. I could say if Shah taught History of Magic I'd be top of the class. It's a pointless statement.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10096": "I suppose that is rather 'legendish'.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10097": "Mind you, all of the founders of Hogwarts are legends if you think about it.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10098": "I suppose you have to make a big decision don't you, to be a legend.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10099": "That would be a big decision though wouldn't it?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10100": "To some.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10101": "Almost everyone.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10102": "Of course. One: You get a sweet named after you. Or a food. Some sort of pie.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10103": "Two: There's a plaque somewhere with your name on it.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10104": "And three: you died horribly or achieved a record amount of points in Quidditch. That is how you become infamous.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10105": "What I don't understand is, if you're so interested in Muggle sporting activities why on earth come here?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10106": "Who did invent cricket then?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10107": "Who invented cricket? I'm curious.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10108": "Oh?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10109": "About what?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10110": "Oh, you're interested in them too then?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10111": "We would shame our families and no one would want to be friends with us.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10112": "If we get expelled, there'll be no pitch to play on anyway. This is an absurd idea. Absurd.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10113": "Very well. Go on then.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10114": "And I want it on record that I believe the remains of this idea shall continue to be absurd.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10115": "I can't believe we're even willing to listen to talk of such rebelliousness.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10116": "Absurd.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10117": "Yes, I'm afraid I'd agree. Let's face it, Black can do whatever he wants. He doesn't even seem to care if he's hated.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10118": "Oh, that's cruel using a real bird.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10119": "Ha. Yes, you wouldn't see that today. What a barbaric lot we were. Glad we're a civilised society now.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10120": "Metal-charmer. My mother used to praise him to no end. 'Mimicked the behaviour of flight patterns, he did.'",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10121": "Sport of Warlocks. The sport of Warlocks should be exercising the mind. Not showing off.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10122": "The thing would've slid straight out of your fingers.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10123": "Ah, the strap. Yes. Stopped it falling out of your hand.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10124": "How do you mean?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10125": "Mm, yes I see what you mean now. Gripping Charms weren't part of Quidditch tradition.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10126": "I can hear my grandfather now, 'Gripping Charms is for those what don't belong on the pitch!'",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10127": "The worst decision made by any headmaster in the history of this school.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10128": "I wish I could use a Gripping Charm around his neck.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10129": "Aimed right at my nose he did. Everyone saw it.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10130": "Ah well he wouldn't, would he? He did it deliberately! Struck at my face but managed to avoid hitting me.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10131": "I should think not. Rotten thing to do. I thought I was about to lose my head!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10132": "Well I should imagine it caused quite a stir.  And I thought the Parkin's Pincer was bad.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10133": "Well, I should think so. Given that it's named after them.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10134": "I tell you, if someone tries to pretend hit me in the face again I shall 'not pretend' hit them back!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10135": "Er – I should imagine the Hogwarts Reverse Transylvanian Tackle.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10136": "What's clever about playing a trick on someone with a Nose-Biting Teacup? I find the matter entirely juvenile.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10137": "What? What do they say?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10138": "That's absurd. I've never heard that.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10139": "I should like to meet her, your grandmother. Her portrait I mean.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10140": "I see. Well, perhaps I shall pass on the invitation, should it come around.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10141": "Yes. Yes it was. Eighty-four she turned.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10142": "Exploding Bonbons and an Acid Pop. She says they help her digestion.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10143": " More likely he didn't get detention.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10144": "Oh? Did you get them all right then?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10145": "My mother told me Charms is the least important subject. She says the only one that matters is Potions.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10146": "Potions.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10147": "Since you're so good at Charms perhaps you could help me with the Summoning Charm. I'm a tad rusty.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10148": "My mother bought me an excess of Leech Juice. I'd be happy to give you some.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10149": "They rarely have it at Pippin's. I'd take the offer if I were you.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10150": "Ugh. Those things are deplorable. Out of the question.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10151": "Fine. I shall eat an Acid Pop. But I'd better come top of the class next time Ronen sets up a challenge.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10152": "You'd do that? Yes, that would be marvellous.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10153": "You're absolute swine, the pair of you.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10154": "And I heard you from the other side of the greenhouse.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10155": "I'm sure you were.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10156": "Everyone knows you're sweet on Garlick.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10157": "It's not as if she'd have let that Venomous Tentacula actually bite you.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10158": "That was some choice language I must say. Anyone would think you'd grown up on a ship.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10159": "Have you drawn your diagram yet?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10160": "No. 'Course I've done it. Was simply asking. Didn't want you to get in trouble.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10161": "Really? I mean, it's not as if I want it to be painful.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10162": "Yes. Just a bit embarrassing is all.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10163": "Oh, that's grand that is, thank you. Do you think you might like to be a part of it?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10164": "Sharp.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10165": "Yes, that's the one.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10166": "I use both for that. Bathing. Put Frog Spawn Soap and a Dungbomb in my brother's bath once. It was fantastic.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10167": "You could hear the screams all down our street. Someone even called the authorities.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10168": "Yes, a lady came to the door. Said she had ways of detecting underage magic and that we should mind ourselves.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10169": "Hear that? You'll never impress her.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10170": "Except for the speed.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10171": "The speed. You said you were impressed by how fast he did it.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10172": "There you are! She says it was a quick hex. So you did impress her. On that front.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10173": "I knew it. Well, a real victory then, isn't it? She's finally impressed!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10174": "I'm good with splinters.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10175": "Well. Useful thing, isn't it? Being good with splinters.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10176": "My broom's not that bad.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10177": "A likely story.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10178": "Oh. Quite the mystery then I see. Glad you 'got to the bottom' of that one.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10179": "If he does it again we should say it's Amit Thakkar.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10180": "To get him in trouble of course.  Chap's so clever he could use some strikes against him.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10181": "Oh, here we go.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10182": "Cruel though, isn't it?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10183": "But you can't say for certain.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10184": "That it wouldn't change the taste. Making the cakes invisible.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10185": "I still think it's cruel to hide cakes. Now if it were beets, well then that's a different story.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10186": "Burn Books?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10187": "Have you perfected it yet?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10188": "Bet you don't have the Porcupine Quills.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10189": "Can we have some?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10190": "I don't know if I've ever been euphoric? Is it like coming top of the class?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10191": "Oh, how exciting!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10199": "Talking about Muggle-borns again?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10200": "Some are quite clever you know. A few quite talented authors. A couple even write books on magic.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10201": "They're very good with Christmas decorations.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10202": "Saw one tear his coat in London once. Muggle that is. Felt awful to not be able to help him with a Mending Charm.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10203": "Not that I would've of course.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10204": "Thomas Brown has some books by Muggles.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10205": "Saw a recipe book last time I was there. At Tomes and Scrolls.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10206": "Oh, that's why you were so bothered.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10207": "Oh I knew I'd heard it somewhere. That's where it's from. Yes, it is a horrid tune. Very strange melody.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10208": "Oh yes. Apparently his father works in a spring carnival. Perhaps winking's part of the trade?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10209": "I'm fairly certain your little sister already looks up to you. Just as you are.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10210": "Next time you hear the humming offender in the library, alert me and I'll sort her out.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10211": "Afraid I can't do anything about Peeves though.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10212": "Now you're pushing it.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10213": "Oh that would be incredible. If you're sure.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10214": "Oh that is a point.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10215": "Mm. 'Tis a bit. I feel more confident knowing I'll be tested, anyway. Who's Barnabas Deverill?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10216": "I thought she did.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10217": "You are such a fibber. Our family has a Crup and last summer he picked up fleas. I know a fleabite when I see it.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10218": "And shall you be telling Howin of this school – negligence?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10219": "What's that red spot on your hand?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10220": "He said it was a creature-induced injury but I don't think so. Reckon he was still trying to levitate himself without magic.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10221": "It's not.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10222": "Said they took him to a ward that felt as though it belonged in a lodge. Lots of wood on the walls, he said.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10223": "Oh, and that there was a portrait of a gruesome looking fellow. Rackharrow, I think he said. Yes, that was it.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10224": "No. Invented a curse. One that expels entrails.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10225": "The Entrail-Expelling Curse.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10226": "What on earth for?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10227": "You mean one where it wouldn't immediately kill you.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10228": "Oh, well that's perfectly fine then, isn't it?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10229": "Oak I think he said. Why?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10230": "Oh. You sound offended. What did I miss?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10231": "Oh. I see.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10232": "Mm, it is rather harsh. What was it made you say that?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10233": "I am curious. Not in the spirit of spreading rumours you understand. Just  – wondering about the wit.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10234": "No! You didn't, did you? Sing a song with Peeves?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10235": "Oh I like singing too.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10236": "Peeves does have some clever lyrics though, doesn't he? Made me laugh a few times.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10237": "It didn't bother me, I swear.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10238": "I – wouldn't have even noticed had someone not mentioned.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10239": "No. She's right. No one did clap. But I know why.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10240": "It's because,  just before the Sorting Ceremony –",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10241": "I'd done a foolish thing. It's my own fault.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10242": "I'd spent time trying to mingle with as many other people as possible and, I moaned about each of the houses.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10243": "So that no one thought I wanted to be in their house. In case I didn't get picked for it. It was stupid, I know.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10244": "Pride. Stupid pride. But I forgot that obviously I'd be sorted into one of the houses. And so everyone was offended.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10245": "No one wanted me in their house. And rightfully so.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10246": "I think I do. Feel a bit better.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10247": "Really?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10248": "Let her finish. There might be a compliment in there somewhere for me.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10249": "I don't – know what to say, but, I feel I should tell you, that I feel – the same. Except about you.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10251": "Come on, where are you?  Re-veal-ius!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10252": "Much better!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10253": "It'd poison the poor beast.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10254": "Ugh, if Black was in Azkaban I should pity the Dementors. The man has no soul to take.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10255": "Besides. Azkaban wouldn't suit Black. Not enough mirrors. ",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10256": "Clever? How offensive. Next!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10257": "Passably. But I'll allow your limp vocabulary.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10258": "Ow! Mind where you're going! You could've killed –",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10259": "This Disillusionment Charm is superb! I'm stealthy as a Demiguise! I'm invincible!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10260": "It's not stupid, how dare –",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10261": "Well if you'd look where you're going instead of barging about!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale2_10262": "Wha – what are you doing? No! –that's –",

  "T3StudentRavenclawMale3_10000": "There’s nothing to give, sir! It was only the one!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale3_10001": "Er, that’s all of them sir, honestly. I swear –",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale3_10002": "We promise, sir. We'd never take more than those –",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale3_10003": "No it wasn’t.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale3_10004": "No it wasn’t. It was Basil Flack.",

  "T3StudentRavenclawMale5_10002": "Sir, I can ex –",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale5_10003": "What?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale5_10004": "You think!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale5_10005": "A week? – I – I don't feel well.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale5_10006": "Wha – ? – don't leave me here!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale5_10007": "Where are you going? You can't leave me here!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale5_10008": "Tomorrow? Argh!",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale5_10009": "Are you all right?  Look like you've seen a ghost.",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale5_10010": "Are they from the Restricted Section?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale5_10011": "They are from the Restricted Section?",
  "T3StudentRavenclawMale5_10012": "I got a look at one of them!  Saw something about the Cruciatus Curse.  I did!",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10003": "– but my father worked at the Ministry so obviously we're an important family.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10004": "What? That's absurd.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10005": "Well – some of them do amass quite a bit of wealth on their own you know?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10006": "Nine lives.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10007": "I suppose if we were Muggles we'd be talking about a canary.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10008": "I'm saying that, if we were in a Muggle school, they'd probably use a canary.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10009": "I read a lot about Muggles I'll have you know. I even know their recipe for pancakes.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10010": "They use them in the mines, you know.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10011": "No, silly. Canaries. They're sensitive to the air, and if it goes bad, they die.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10012": "He's right. You can't throw a Gobstone without bumping into a Muggle in London.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10013": "Oh, the one with the embroidery of the Jobberknolls? Such a pretty shade of blue, that one.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10014": "Oh, how useful.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10015": "(giggling)",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10016": "Oh, I know who you're talking about. That was last year and she got caught. Spent a week in detention.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10017": "I agree. I wouldn't want to sleep next to someone who had a Bowtruckle under their bed.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10018": "I shall be sure to set my Bowtruckle on you.  If I ever get it.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10019": "It's just the same with Muggles. They can be born into money and never have to work for it either.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10020": "Oh, that's not true at all. In fact, I'd say they work harder than magical folk. They can't just wave a wand.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10021": "I'm not 'sticking up for them', I'm simply stating the truth. I bet you've never had to till a field.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10022": "I rest my case.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10023": "Well, fortunately for everyone, no one in their right mind would want to work for you anyway.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10024": "I don't find them that boring.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10025": "Although I did vow never to ask you about Defence Against the Dark Arts since you tried to explain the Boggart-Banishing Spell.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10026": "No she's not. Your jokes are never funny. You're as bad as Ronen.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10027": "It's true. I didn't want to say anything but since they brought it up –",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10028": "Sadly, not. We're under our own steam I'm afraid and it's time you learned the truth. You're not amusing in the least.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10029": "A Kneazle? Your Boggart would be – a Kneazle?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10030": "How do you know? What did he say?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10031": "Oh, he does. He wrote on mine! 'Adequate'.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10032": "Is that when you were writing in the library?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10033": "Oh. I put that there.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10034": "I didn't mean to get your hopes up; I'd picked it in the greenhouse – Garlick said I could –",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10035": "– and then I put it down on your book while I went to look up something on magical theory. Must've forgot it.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10036": "Anyone else feel completely invisible right now?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10037": "Don't be a moonmind. That would defeat the purpose of the canary: they see the dead bird and know they need to leave.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10038": "Lucky to have him, I say.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10039": "If you're referring to Quidditch, I couldn't agree more. Sport is for Neanderthals. And Muggles.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10040": "Oh, well that was rude of you.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10041": "A headmaster is supposed to be firm; steer the ship, command respect. It's a mission not many would take on.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10042": "Don't talk such nonsense. Black will be remembered as the man who lifted the school to greatness. Strict and striving.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10043": "Stop it. Don't be so silly. No wonder Black hates you.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10044": "I'm sure he doesn't hate you.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10045": "Rubbish.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10046": "They'd still be burning us.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10047": "Burned you'd be. If you so much as petted a cat. Burned.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10048": "Why do you think we're not in cricket?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10049": "Is anyone listening to me?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10050": "What? No. No we're not playing cricket! As I was saying, we were banned from participating in Muggle sports.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10051": "Give me strength.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10052": "I – that's – what I'm saying. That Statute of Secrecy has saved the lives of millions in the wizarding world.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10053": " Somebody please Obliviate me?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10054": "S'pose they might, mightn't they?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10055": "The conceit of the whole thing was – brilliant. A true landmark in our history.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10056": "And that's what they'd do to us now if they could. Burn us.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10057": "Hmph. Wouldn't doubt it.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10058": "No it's not. There are many ways that Muggles differ from us. It's completely plausible that they have different tongues.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10059": "Mm, most likely, yes. Would suit their treachery.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10060": "How so? We're simply stating the facts. Or at least things we believe might possibly be facts.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10061": "But I heard it.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10062": "Well –",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10063": "What? Yes, well, I – fine. I didn't actually hear it from someone. But I do believe it to be true. What's wrong with that?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10064": "I mean – they might be able to see – a bit.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10065": "Oh, I don't know. Hard to top Ronen.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10066": "Mmm. You know her mother is a Muggle?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10067": "Hardly any point in worrying though, is there? Not as if we'll actually be playing.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10068": "I've never seen someone so infuriatingly obstinate. He doesn't even listen to the other professors.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10069": "Hmph. Just my luck to be here when we have this wretched man governing over us. Not to mention that he's Slytherin.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10070": "That's a bit harsh.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10071": "Oh, well this is all very reassuring. Glad to know I'm amongst friends.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10072": "I could hardly watch.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10073": "No. You're just – awful. Shamefully. If I were a vengeful girl I'd say you should be sent to play for Durmstrang.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10074": "I wouldn't upset yourself. You're good at so many other things.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10075": "It's been blustery of late. Could simply be dust blown in from the street. I wouldn't worry about it.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10076": "Yes, if we rule out Spintwitches I'd say we're rather out of luck for brooms.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10077": "Wipe it? She shouldn't have to wipe it if she's paid full price. No, I say tell the man. He needs to know about this dust.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10078": "One has to wonder.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10079": "A cup. Granted a very nice and highly sought after one.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10080": "That's precisely my point. You work hard. Train. Practise. Exhaust yourself. And unless you win – it's pointless.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10081": "Well I shan't be encouraging my children to play. Not unless I feel very confident they can win at it.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10082": "Yes. Don't you?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10083": "Quidditch is about clawing your way to the top.  The glint of the wing of that Golden Snitch before you grasp it –",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10084": "And then being lauded by your peers as a champion. That – is the point of Quidditch.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10085": "No.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10086": "What absolute drivel.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10087": "We should plan something. Some sort of trick – to punish Black.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10088": "Better yet, get a runny-nosed first-year to do it. Entice them with some spell they wouldn't learn till the sixth year.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10089": "Fine. Next round of Butterbeers is on you.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10090": "I'm only teasing. Don't worry. I already have three snotty-nosed first-years begging to buy me a Butterbeer.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10091": "I told them that one of the Mandrakes in Garlick's class is especially deadly. Said I'd tell them which one.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10092": "We walk too, silly.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10093": "One could argue that our legs are weaker because we use brooms. There. How's that for an idea?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10094": "Well then. You're open to the notion that I'm presenting?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10095": "Didn't it scare you? Finding it in your boot like that?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10096": "You were too busy talking about having seen a flock of butterflies as I recall.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10097": "Strange, a Niffler in your Wellington. I thought they only went after shiny things?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10098": "Oh, how exciting! Did you find something on the walk? The other day?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10099": "I bet someone dropped it, likely on their way from Dogweed and Deathcap.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10100": "Would you let me borrow it one day? Just for a little while?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10101": "Oh I can't wait. I wonder what I shall find?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10102": "Oh don't be such a spoil sport. You're only jealous.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10103": "And rose thorns.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10104": "Then I don't understand. Why would you not wish to sit with him in the Great Hall when we have dinner?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10105": "But that's absurd.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10106": "Well. If it were me, I wouldn't so much as lend him some ink.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10107": "Don't you worry. There's at least five in Slytherin placing wagers on the Cannons as we speak.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10108": "You'll not be short of kindred spirits when it comes to rallying for the Chudley Cannons. Not in our house.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10109": "Can you imagine? At the very least it would be entertaining.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10110": "What do you mean?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10111": "Sorrowful past?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10112": "Poor Professor Ronen. I never would've thought – he always seems in such good spirits.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10113": "One day what?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10114": "Goodness gracious.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale1_10115": "He'd still be hysterical playing Quidditch though, wouldn't he? ",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10000": "Yes you were. You were staring right at Everett Clopton. I saw it too.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10001": "Yes! Swear on your life.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10002": "Ooh! Can you draw my Devil's Snare for me next time? I'm horrible at those – they always look like my grandmother's hands.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10003": "Oh, er –",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10004": "It's true. It's a wonder Garlick can even tell your homework's for her class.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10005": "Ooh, you little Snidget.  You're getting married, you're getting married – ",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10006": "But it's only Transfiguration. And you know Weasley would never expel you.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10007": "I bet we could learn more exploring the Highlands than watching a rat turn into an oil lamp.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10008": "Oh, come on, you know we'd have fun. How is missing one class going to impair your academic career?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10009": " Ugh.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10010": "Good, because I'm imagining there are some tasty potions we could find.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10011": "No, silly. Potions that we won't be taught in class. Forbidden potions.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10012": "Oh, there's probably everything. And as long as the librarian isn't about I'm sure it's not that hard to get in.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10013": "Oh, you're so boring. It's a wonder Gryffindor hasn't cast you out. Fine. Let's just do our homework.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10014": "And they were quite competent on a broom.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10015": "Well – I think you should fly outside of school bounds.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10016": "Because then the rumours would be true.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10017": "You probably just haven't found the right broom yet.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10018": "I'm sure Kogawa would spend extra time with you.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10019": "There's just one problem.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10020": "Who said you were any good at flying?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10021": "I don't think a Puffskein yearns to be around a pile of dusty old books.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10022": "You're lucky the librarian didn't see you. You and Balthazar would both be in detention.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10023": "All I'm saying is to please let me know next time. That's all.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10024": "Oh, any sort of sneaking is most definitely exciting. I shan't be left out again.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10025": "Hmph. I wasn't told about that.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10026": "Kogawa doesn't seem to like a lot of us, but I bet she does really.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10027": "As a matter of fact, I think she quite likes me. And I'm even more horrible at flying than you.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10028": "It's a good way to get attention, that is.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10029": "Being good at Quidditch.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10030": "What? Did you say something?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10031": "Muggles have it – better? Have you ever tried to ride a horse?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10032": "You're not a Muggle-born are you?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10037": "It's true.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10038": "Well, I'm not going to just do it right here, am I?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10039": "Why not? Because I might attract the attention of snakes wishing to converse!",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10040": "Very well. Ahem.  Shhhhh. Hashaaaah –",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10041": "Imagine. A carriage ride through London.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10042": "Not the same at all. The excitement would be how he might ask for your hand.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10043": "Ugh, I dream about it.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10044": "And he'd have to go down to the shop to buy you some flowers. He couldn't just conjure them up.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10045": "Mm. That did it for me. My mind's made up.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10046": "Ugh. That's revolting.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10047": "Oh, I think I did hear something about this. Yes. They don't actually bite, yet somehow manage to suck your blood.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10048": "Ah. That's nice.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10049": "Very clever.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10050": "You wouldn't be saying that if you'd spent an hour having dinner with one.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10051": "For starters, they don't wash.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10052": "Are you saying I'm a liar?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10053": "Don't believe me, I don't care. Our neighbour has a housekeeper who once cleaned the house of a Muggle.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10054": "And she said it was filthy. Said they lived like animals.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10055": "Not that it matters, but I believe it was a farm. With farm animals. Filthy she said it was.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10056": "I might have expected you'd make excuses for them. I feel I'm wasting my breath.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10057": "No. What's your point?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10058": "Very clever.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10059": "Very clever.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10060": "And so I should be going on about it. She's a traitor, and not a thing less!",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10061": "She ate a Cornish pasty. That is not wizarding food. You tell me one wizard you've seen eating a Cornish pasty.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10062": "Go on! I can forgive her the pancakes because I'm fairly sure we came up with those, but a Cornish pasty? No.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10063": "Do either of you have any sense of loyalty to your kind? Dignity? Self-respect?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10064": "Besides, it was the French who came up with that.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10065": "Because now he's showing some integrity. Obviously he experienced something untoward.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10066": "Someone from Beauxbatons, was it?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10067": "It's an interesting theory though, isn't it? That it's all in the name?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10068": "That a person's surname conveys everything you need to know about them, including their blood status.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10069": "Precisely.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10070": "My point is, what if you can tell what line of work they're in as well? Or at least something about them.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10071": "I'm simply theorising that, for example, the name Slughorn could stem from ancestors who were involved with slugs.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10072": "And Shacklebolt. Likely a heritage of working with metals.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10073": "Don't be silly.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10075": "Obviously herbologists.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10076": "Likely one of them had a very bad back.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10077": "Oh, no. They didn't do much. Likely we won't hear about them for much longer. Common name, that one.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10078": "Ha. Not a chance.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10079": "Oh? What sort of hobby?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10080": "How do Patronus essays interfere with buying you a broom?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10081": "She's not an abysmal sister at all. She's entitled to follow her own passions and not be beholden to others.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10082": "What's to say broom flying isn't a whim? What's her Patronus, anyway?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10083": "Oh, stop it. Well? I bet it's a big fierce bear.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10084": "I knew it!",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10085": "A hard knock from a Bludger would do it I'm sure. Likely it was quite nasty, whatever it was.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10086": "I think I know what he means. You'd like to know that the injury was on a par with the impact of cancelling Quidditch.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10087": "What about if they broke every bone in their body? Would that do it?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10088": "Or mother.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10089": "Old enough to be your mother. The shopkeeper. Of Spintwitches Sporting Needs.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10090": "Well, few of us are experienced in that regard.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10091": "I didn't know that. I'm not fully sure I agree either.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10092": "Well I didn't.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10093": "Yes?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10094": "Yes?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10095": "Oh, I see.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10096": "And how does one get a sweet named after them? Or – some sort of pie?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10097": "My mother's friend's housekeeper works at the Ministry. Cleans there on Fridays. Perhaps she has some details?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10098": "Oh, housekeepers know all the secrets. Works for Spavin himself on a Friday.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10099": "Only that's he's not fond of centaurs.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10100": "By the looks of his face I'd say he's already had a run in with the Dementors.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10101": "No need to be so serious.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10102": "I'd say you were lucky it was cancelled then.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10103": "You haven't got a Niffler's chance of winning the Quidditch Cup.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10104": "If there were more than one Seeker then it would be a completely different game though, wouldn't it? Silly idea.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10105": "True. You are rather like a balloon that someone's let the air out of.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10106": "What a pair of little babies you two are. I've never heard such waffling. The game should be hard. That's the point.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10107": "Shame? Shame about what?  Oh, you mean there were birds' eggs in there.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10108": "Starling I reckon. Lovely eggs, Starlings. Much better than blackbirds.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10109": "Well, you had said 'Shame.' so I think we were thinking that perhaps there were eggs in the nest. Birds' eggs.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10110": "Well you should've said, shouldn't you.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10111": "Hmph. 'Bout the only thing interesting to ever come out of Godric's Hollow, I can tell you that much.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10112": "'I would've been in the Wigtown Wanderers. Would've suited me perfectly.'",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10113": "Wasn't that the club started by a butcher? Used to stand at the sides with his butcher's knife, didn't he?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10114": "He had seven children didn't he, the founder? Four boys and three girls.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10115": "That's right, blood red robes they wear, to honour that he was a butcher.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10116": "'Why couldn't I have been born in their time, and played alongside those sisters?'",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10117": "It really is most intriguing.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10118": "Although I suppose they did have the strap.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10119": "Still. Marvellous discovery, the Gripping Charms.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10120": "You don't think the teams would have been thrilled to bits to not have to hold onto a little strap?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10121": "We should try it. Playing Quidditch without using Gripping Charms.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10122": "Oh, except, for one tiny moment I forgot – Black cancelled Quidditch. Urgh!",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10123": "Ah, the Transylvanian Tackle. Don't see that much.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10124": "Yes, it's a cunning little move. The first time someone used it was at the World Cup of 1473.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10125": "I wonder if they do it a lot in Transylvania? The Transylvanian Tackle?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10126": "Mm yes, yes.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10127": "Oh. Well that's easy enough.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10135": "As a matter of fact you are.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10136": "However – in this particular instance I may have to side with my fine colleague here.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10137": "It was a very good hex though.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10138": "I didn't think toenails could get any uglier. Will you teach me that?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10139": "You drive a hard bargain.  When can we start?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10140": "And likely for good reason.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10141": "Oh, that does sound fun.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10142": "That's why we need new ways to torment them. Ones that don't leave marks.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10143": "And that the only thing left of it was his name signed on the front.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10144": "Have you not done it yet? Thought you'd be eager for that one.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10145": "Should be extinguishing dragons if you ask me.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10146": "The roar? You mean the roar of the dragons?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10147": "But the assignment was to write about the flame and the differences between how it comes out.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10148": "No, of course not. Just humiliating.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10149": "Sharp? As in Professor Aesop Sharp. The most crotchety Potions teacher anyone's ever met?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10150": "No doubt the dusty thing feasted up your snout all night. Ugh. Revolting.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10151": "Your nose is big enough. I'm sure you could sustain an army of the things.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10152": "I'm not exactly sure we'll be crying at your modicum of dubious wealth –",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10153": "– but what on earth makes you think anyone would want bags of your flea-ridden old Puffskein hair?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10154": "Oh. Well you'd better start sharing it with us then. I like the sound of this.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10155": "Fine. Consider us your best friends. Now, where is our charming little ferret?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10156": "'Strength through loyalty'.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10157": "No silly. That wouldn't be very appropriate for a bank.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10158": "What? What's a code?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10159": "What? What draught? Who made?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10160": "Oh, now I know who you're talking about. Yes, she's a bit of a busybody that one. Wouldn't trust her an inch.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10161": "She told me her uncle fancies himself a bit of a potioneer. Apparently, he's given her all sorts of concoctions.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10162": "What? Th – that's not a thing. Yes I reckon he's definitely been Confunded.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10163": "No.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10164": "Only if your broom looks like a doomed branch that's been trampled by a mountain troll. Possibly then it's useful.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10165": "And what makes you think he used an Invisibility Spell? Those are quite hard, aren't they?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10166": "I bet I know who it was. It was that boy from Newark-on-Trent wasn't it? Third-year.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10167": "Saw him going over Hogsmeade on it. Lovely broom the Wind Wisp. Really good sprint to it. And a sharp turn.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10168": "Anyway. At least you're good with splinters.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10169": "Not to mention the Statute.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10170": "Oh, that's right. 'Should any creature cause harm to, or draw the notice of, the Muggle community – '",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10171": "Paragraph C of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery. You could be expelled.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10172": "I am not! But Muggles are just so – defenceless. They're like lambs. And you did trip that lady three times.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10173": "I just – hate wasting food.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10174": "My father does all the baking in our house. I would try hiding them but there's never time.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10175": "Because they're eaten so quickly.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10176": "Mm – no. They're far too good for that. It might change the taste.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10177": "But your cakes are horrible.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10178": "They taste like someone dug up a dead terrier.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10179": "You wouldn't know if it changed the taste of your cakes, because it would simply be a different degree of foul.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10180": "I was being polite.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10181": "That the one where someone opens a book and it catches fire?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10182": "Good name then, really.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10183": "Why not? In fact, I think they should insist that we go alone. Imagine how much simpler that would be.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10184": "No, because you don't have to worry about dragon pox. Yes of course so you don't have to ask someone.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10185": "Oh? Please proceed.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10186": "Who abandons Erumpents? I haven't heard of that, is it a thing?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10187": "Sure you're all right?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10188": "How very tragic. I'd never thought of you in that light. Abandoned. Well it's settled then.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10189": "Should such an instance arise as to require us to attend a dance – we shall all go together.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10190": "No.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10191": "She would say: No. That's how she could do it. Only sounding much more terrifying. Like an angry Kneazle.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10192": "Or a Thestral that hurt its hoof. Or perhaps a Manticore that'd lost a cub.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10193": "What is it you imagine you'll find in there? In the Restricted Section?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10194": "Ah, the truth comes out! So this fixation isn't so much about secret spells as it is about breaking the rules.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10195": "Is there a rule against drawing Black? I wasn't aware.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10196": "Oh yes. No. Of course.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10197": "There are so many old books in the library I'd say you'd be hard pressed to find one without a turned page.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10198": "I'd win.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10199": "I have sharp eyes. Like a Hippogriff my mother says.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10200": "Oh yes, I'm good at that! Delicate hand. Like a Bowtruckle my mother says.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10201": "I'll be tested too.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10202": "Good to stay in top form!",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10203": "That won't work.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10204": "Because we shall hear each other. Then we'll know the answers.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10205": "Yes. And if it involves warlocks I shall need extra time.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10206": "I struggle to recall details regarding warlocks. Unless it's Barnabas Deverill. Then it's fine.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10207": "I would think a Puffskein's best friend would be – another Puffskein.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10208": "It wasn't his fault at all then. For causing the nosebleed.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10209": "Happy to. Any of you hear about the incident in the courtyard?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10210": "Apparently a little scuffle. One boy hit another in the face. They said that the one that was hit was quite a coward.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10211": "How would you know? Wait – was that you? That was hit?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10212": "You know I hate being left out.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10213": "And you know I like a good Cauldron Cake. Rascals, going without me.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10214": "That's even worse. I've found you out.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10215": "And did you go to Steepley's?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10216": "Scoundrels. Both of you. I shall remember this next time you ask me about Clabberts.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10217": "And Chizpurfles. You're on your own with Howin now.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10218": "Well why didn't you say that in the first place? Consider the matter closed, and – all is forgiven.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10219": "Did he say what it was like at St Mungo's?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10220": "Interesting.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10221": "Oh. A founder of the hospital do you think?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10222": "I've never been to St Mungo's. Always wanted to go.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10223": "I thought I might be lucky and get to see a werewolf, in a civilised environment.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10224": "Oh, I would only go up close if it was in a public ward. And of course I'd mind it wasn't a full moon.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10225": "Well it's their own fault for saving it. And then letting it grow fond of them.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10226": "Anyway, I don't see the concern. They have a friendly crow that won't leave them alone. What's the harm?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10227": "What's so dire about at a barrage of omens? They might be good ones.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10228": "Oh? And what's her belief about the crow?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10229": "Absurd. Surely they can lure it away with a few earthworms.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10230": "Not got an irrational fear of earthworms, has she?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10231": "Are you always this dramatic about everything?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10232": "As bad as Ronen with your theatrics.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10233": "Or – they did.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10234": "Not at all. But admit, it is rather unusual for no one to clap when the house is called at the Sorting Ceremony. No one.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10235": "But then even when you walked to the table, to sit with them – not a one of them clapped.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10236": "What? What did you do?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10237": "But why would you do that?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10238": "What a moonmind!",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10239": "Not for long. You can forget it if you think I'm going to let you live this down.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10240": "I shan't miss you.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10241": "Suit yourself.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10242": "Liar.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10243": "Highly unlikely.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10244": "Are you talking about death?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10245": "Hmph.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10246": "Did you give her Alihotsy?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale2_10247": "Charming. I despise you both. Now when are we getting those Butterbeers?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale3_10000": "Because I told you: I can transfigure one!",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale3_10001": "Soon get us a Snitch!  Non-verbal spells are very difficult.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale3_10002": "Yes, Madam Kogawa.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale3_10003": "It was only a toad in the fountain –",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale3_10004": "It was only her toad, Professor.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale3_10005": "See. I told you.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale4_10000": "Why are you doing this? It’s cruel -",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale4_10001": "Now look what you’ve done.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale4_10002": "We’re very sorry, Headmaster.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale4_10003": "I told you, but you wouldn’t listen.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale4_10004": "I’ve seen her do it, it’s true!",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale4_10005": "And risky! You could never do one!",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale4_10006": "Of course, ma’am.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale4_10007": "I told you she was good, didn’t I? You should see her with a cookpot!",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale4_10008": "What if he sticks like this?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale4_10009": "It didn't before. That other boy was like it for a week.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale4_10010": " I've just realised –",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale4_10011": "I have an essay I need to finish for Binns. Two inches.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale4_10012": "Did you memorise the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale4_10013": "I – I think I heard one.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale6_10000": "It's only her toad, silly.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale6_10001": "If it’d been my toad, it'd still –",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale6_10002": "Don't be silly, it'll wear off in a few hours. I think.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale6_10003": "Oh, stop fretting, we'll have you with Nurse Blainey in no time.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale6_10004": "What? What is it?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale6_10005": "Merlin's, I haven't done mine either! Er –",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale6_10006": "Not yet, no.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinFemale6_10007": "You'll be fine! I'll check on you tomorrow.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10000": "My father once nearly died in the fire of a Streeler so I'd say that beats working at the Ministry any day.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10001": "You can't possibly think that? That would mean any half-blood with wealth is more important than a pure-blood.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10002": "Except what? You've not got another one of your notions about some heroic Muggle, have you?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10003": "So do Nifflers. Doesn't mean we should round them up and give them a vault at Gringotts.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10004": "My father once nearly died of a Niffler scratch. Went very septic, it did.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10005": "Nine lives.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10009": "Yes, well I'm sure riding a horse would be just as good as riding a broom.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10010": "Don't be absurd. Of course it can't.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10011": "Obviously a broom is better – because you can fly on it. I don't recall ever seeing a person flying a horse.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10012": "What?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10013": "Not again.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10014": "You asked Kogawa – if we could enchant a horse?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10015": "(sigh) I literally wonder why I bother sometimes.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10016": "Well you would, wouldn't you?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10017": "Everyone knows you come from money.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10018": "Can you hear yourself. My heart bleeds for you. 'So many things and nowhere to put them'.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10019": "You're on.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10020": "I'll have to stop into Tomes and Scrolls by the sound of it. I'm a bit behind in Beasts.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10021": "Consider it on my list. As long as I get to see a Hippocampus egg, I'm in.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10022": "I'll likely take you up on that, thank you.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10023": "What? I mean – oh, really.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10024": "Oh. Well, that's – bravo. Bravo.  Well, I – look forward to seeing that transparent egg.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10025": "Oh, I should think most of them are like that. My father says Muggles don't know what hard work is.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10026": "Mm, I might have known you'd stick up for them.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10027": "I most certainly have not.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10028": "Ugh, as if we could expect you to know about anything involving soil.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10029": "All I know is, if I had to hire someone to work for me, it wouldn't be a Muggle.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10030": "Oh, you little Crupmite.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10031": "I hope you both know how magnificently boring you both sound.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10032": "I thought Binns was bad enough but listening to you pair, I think there's new talent on the mantle.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10033": "I'm not saying I wouldn't take a bit of help with my homework, you understand.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10034": "Fair enough. In that case, you're still undeniably boring.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10035": "'Dabbing' at you – ?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10036": "What's your Boggart, then?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10037": "That's more like it. That's a fear with a bit of logic behind it. Not like a cat.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10038": "Then he's definitely a goner.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10039": "Oh, you little Snidget. I trusted you with that.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10040": "Just a minute – isn't that the test you copied off me?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10041": "So, to be clear; you're complaining – about getting poor marks – on a test – that you cheated on.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10042": "Well. That takes some beating, doesn't it.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10043": "I'm sure someone'd give you a red rose.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10044": "It's just that – I think she's telling a lie.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10045": "Yes, but, how would we know?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10046": "Precisely. I'm glad someone sees some sense.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10047": "That's exactly what I'm saying. Glad you agree.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10048": "I rest my case. That first-year has Muggle grandparents and I know it.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10049": "No, she's right. Killed in droves we were in medieval times. Terrible persecution it was for magical folk.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10050": "Yes, it's not a real bat. Not one of our bats.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10051": "Well I saw a picture in a book.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10052": "Not entirely. Although if you squinted your eyes a bit –",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10053": "Yes, I heard it too.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10054": "Well, I – I heard it from you.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10055": "Don't confuse friendliness for foolishness. Ronen's nothing more than a clown sometimes.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10056": "Besides. Don't you think it's uncomfortable when she mentions her mother?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10057": "The other day, she's explaining how valuable dittany is in magical draughts –",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10058": "– next thing you know, she's going on about her mother in Gloucester. I don't think Black'd like it.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10059": "The thing is, why does she have to bring it up, I say.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10060": "We're here to learn about Herbology, not hear details of her filthy heritage.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10061": "What does that have to do with it?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10062": "With that line of thinking am I to assume that because they drink tea they can brew a Sleeping Draught?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10063": "What is this, some sort of Muggle march? The notion that Muggles might be marvellous at Quidditch is absurd.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10064": "It's the same as saying that if I journey on a train, I'd likely be a marvellous duellist. It's not at all related.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10065": "Or, or – if I was eating an egg sandwich that I'd make a marvellous chef. It's completely nonsensical.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10066": "Oh. Good. Because if you weren't agreeing with me then we should stand to fall out. And I wouldn't want that.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10067": "Well. I always appreciate your insights into the realm of our non-magical kin. Perhaps on an annual basis.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10068": "I didn't say that.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10069": "Oh I wouldn't say that. You weren't entirely abysmal the last time you played.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10070": "I'm not sure I agree with that theory myself. Hard work is where true prowess is forged.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10071": "Yes, make up your mind. Are we born with it or do we have to actually get on our confounded brooms and work at it?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10072": "May I say that I feel you're being a tad harsh?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10073": "Do be quiet. Please. I think you're all being rather melodramatic. I'm an, at least, moderately adequate player.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10074": "Don't look at me like that. Why are you all looking at me like that? I am. What? Surely there are worse players than me?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10075": "Why are you all being silent? It's as if someone's cast the Confundus Charm on you all.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10076": "You can't be serious. I've seen that boy and he has more hope of catching dragon pox than the Golden Snitch.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10077": "Oh? Like what?  What? Oh don't tell me you can't think of one thing? You're an abysmal lot, all of you.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10078": "Should think I'd get more encouragement from a Hungarian Horntail.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10079": "'Second-year who hums a lot'. How atrociously offensive.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10080": "I'm after the Yew Weaver. That's what I'm saving my Sickles for.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10081": "It's an important thing a broom. Can give you a lot of confidence, the right broom. Even if you're not a good flier.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10082": "That's not true at all. I'm a fine flier.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10083": "Let's hope.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10084": "And then it's over.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10085": "You feel the sport only has value if you win at it?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10086": "I'd honestly never thought about it before. Not until you mentioned.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10087": "Not as much as Muggles. We have brooms like a civilised society.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10088": "I'm not looking for an argument.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10089": "I'm not going to debate the implausible theory that Muggles have stronger legs than ours, if that's what you mean.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10090": "What?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10091": "They walk anywhere. Wherever they want. 'Where do they walk?'; what a preposterous question.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10092": "You know I really have to question sometimes whether you are actually a witch.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10093": "Rats should be killed. Vile things.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10094": "Nonsense. Unless you're talking about that second-year who's always covered in feathers, in which case then I'd agree.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10095": "A lucky Knut? And what, pray tell, constitutes a lucky Knut?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10096": "I'd keep it. Why not? Their own fault for being careless.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10097": "Oh don't say you're being lured into this superstitious fantasy?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10098": "Your common sense if you're lucky.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10099": "Pfft. I don't think so. I mean, I daresay I could let it sit on my desk in Potions one day. Keep Sharp at bay.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10100": "I wasn't being serious. It's nonsense. Should think the Knut could stand some luck to escape from your boot.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10101": "A lot of laughter from a man with such tragedy.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10102": "Hides a sorrowful past. That's what I've heard.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10103": "Had a son who died. So I'm told.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10104": "Got in with a bad lot. Apparently severed himself from his own family. And then one day –",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10105": "Well. The way I heard it was that Ronen went to collect some of his son's things, no doubt expecting him to be dead –",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10106": "I suppose on account it had been so long. Anyway, he arrives to get the things – and meets his son's ghost.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10107": "You have to admire the man. Having such a loss and going about the way he does.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10108": "Funny, I'm in your class and I never received this assignment.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10109": "I take offence to that.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10110": "Humility is such a virtue.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10111": "What?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10112": "They've won the League Cup, goodness, must be twenty times by now!",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10113": "It's almost – traitorous.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10114": "Emphatically yes. The boy's clearly an ogre. Point him out to me and he'll have a Trip Jinx coming his way.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10115": "I will.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10116": "You'll know better next time.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10117": "All I know is, if I was flying about in a match, the last thing I'd want was someone fainting and dropping on me.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale1_10118": "In the event that Quidditch is one day restored to the premises of this school, your teammates deserve to know.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10004": "Oh? What was it?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10005": "Well, even if you had it, half the school would've been after it. You'd have had to have had a griffin to guard it.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10006": "And what happened – with the hourglass? Why wasn't it yours in the end?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10007": "Mm. No, I suppose not. Although – if we're talking about Sharp's class –",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10008": "I don't care if Weasley is nice, I find everything about Transfiguration utterly unnerving.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10009": "Mm, I suppose so.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10010": "What?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10011": "Wasn't serious?  Oh dear. I'm never going back to that class.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10012": "What?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10013": "And she's a Hufflepuff. Probably wants to be turned into a Venomous Tentacula.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10014": "You haven't heard the way she talks. She almost jokes about it, 'What's the harm in becoming flora?' I'm serious.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10015": "Well, I'm just saying. And if it ever happens when I'm in class, she can get help off someone else.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10016": "What? Oh dear. I think I'm already on her bad side. Oh dear.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10017": "Very funny. Very funny indeed.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10018": "Weasley would never transfigure a student. That girl is potty, keep asking if she can be turned into something.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10019": "That's rather presumptuous. How can you possibly think you're more pure than me?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10020": "That's rubbish. I saw you in a Muggle inn on Carnaby Street the last time I was in London.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10021": "All I know is you had at least two steak and kidney pies in the time that I was watching.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10022": "It's not the same trifle at all. Theirs is horrible, and don't even get me started on that sludge they call custard.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10023": "Someone who can spot a Muggle lover a mile away. And you had a Muggle pudding.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10024": "I want you to do my Herbology homework.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10025": "It's an essay. Three inches. Serves you right for lowering yourself to frequent a Muggle pub.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10026": "Thank you. And if the essay gets good marks, your dirty little secret can stay just between us.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10027": "And be sure to pay keen attention to the history of Horklumps as they pertain to the evolution of farming.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10028": "Wouldn't want to disappoint Garlick now, would we.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10029": "That's what I'm saying. You could be in prime form, your team's fourteen goals to one, they catch the Snitch, and you're even!",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10030": "It's an outrage if you ask me.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10031": "Well. I'd have it at least be eleven.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10032": "Now that I think of it, if it were up to me, I could go up to fifty.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10033": "Yes. Yes. That's what I think's fair.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10034": "Hm. Now I'm hearing it, still sounds unfair. Hmph. There's no way of making that game fair and that's the trouble.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10035": "Ugh. You're a cold one, aren't you?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10036": "What?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10037": "Ah well. Yes, that's the thing. Shame really, that I can't play.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10038": "Well, they're funny things kneecaps. It's when you're on an incline, it's not so painful. Just the broom, mainly it hurts.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10039": "No. Really a Herbology person if I'm honest.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10040": "Apparently she was a marvellous Seeker.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10041": "Why not? What's to say the Magpies won't take you one day?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10042": "I'm serious. I've seen you play. You're nothing to sniff at.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10043": "What who said?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10044": "Oh. Yes, yes of course. What, do you mean about the Snitch not being fast enough?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10045": "It's all relative though, isn't it?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10046": "I mean: if you're flaming through the air on an Albie Weekes special, the Snitch is likely well in your grasp.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10047": "Of course not. But it's a combination, isn't it? Sharp broom. Sharp player.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10048": "You have to believe it. How else will you stand a chance?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10049": "Ha! Don't worry. I only want you in the Magpies so I know I have a good opponent to beat.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10050": "I made my own.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10051": "Wasn't hard. Had some dung and a few dead scarab beetles. Worked very well.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10052": "That's what I said.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10053": "No. It wasn't. It was better.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10054": "Simple. If you practise with something that can't kill you it makes you take chances; push yourself.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10055": "Of course. Added a bit of glue, enchanted it to chase me. How else do you think I built up such confidence on the pitch?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10056": "And do you remember seeing other students practising their craft on the moors?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10057": "No. Because they weren't confident. But I evidently was worthy of remembering.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10058": "Well, if you ever want to borrow my beetle Bludger you only need ask. It'll bring your confidence out.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10059": "No.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10060": "Beetle Bludger. It's more beetle than dung.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10061": "Very well. I shall equip you with the beetle Bludger tomorrow. You'll be beaming with confidence in no time!",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10062": "But don't break it. You're awful with a club. Like an Erumpent in a blindfold. It's a wonder you broom doesn't flee.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10063": "How many did you hit?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10064": "Oh! The one who performs the Bubble-Head Charm on herself before Potions?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10065": "Yes. Did you get that one who keeps the spider behind his ear?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10066": " Victory.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10067": "Oh? What makes you say that?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10068": "They're a bargain if you ask me. I never feel anxious about using up a Stink Pellet.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10069": "Stink Pellets?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10070": "Ugh. Think I'd rather take my chances with the Fireball than with Scribner.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10071": "No! You wouldn't.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10072": "You wouldn't fancy reading up on a secret spell? Or a forbidden charm?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10073": "Mm, I understand. Why stir the pot with professors when there's oblivious first-years to torment?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10074": "Mm, I like her too. We still on for putting Exploding Bonbons in the greenhouse then?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10075": "I'm shocked Black hasn't got rid of her yet.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10076": "Well she'd better not do it again.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10077": "Of course, we mustn't let on that we're scared of her.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10078": "I don't blame you. She could misinterpret it.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10079": "You looking at her. She might take it as a sign.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10080": "Yes. Some sort of sign of defiance.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10081": "I don't blame you. She could hex you.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10082": "Yes. For being defiant.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10083": "I'm only saying – if she thinks you're being defiant – and then hexes you, well, that's that isn't it?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10084": "Well. She'll keep giving you those Hiccough sweets, won't she? And you know how much Ronen enjoys that.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10085": "Well. If you do my Charms homework, I'll have a word with her for you.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10086": "Course I am. But I'm more scared of getting bad marks in Charms.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10087": "Naturally I'll need to come top in the class.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10088": "Oh. Well in that case it's off. I hope she does hex you. Sounds most entertaining.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10089": "Yes. You'd hidden a bucket of leaping toadstools over at the far end.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10090": "I got told off for that.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10091": "Well I was mildly distracted by the shuffling of the Mandrakes, I do believe. Do you recall that part too?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10092": "Tell you what, I'll forget the whole thing if you can spot me some sneezewort and scurvy-grass.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10093": "Yes. There's a third-year who keeps enchanting my quill to go up my nose. Time he learned who's in charge here.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10094": "Plus it's an old quill. Clearly has feathers of some horrible bird that had no pride. Very painful up a nostril, I can tell you.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10095": "Always. And don't be stingy on the sneezewort.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10096": "Could've started a fire. And I'm afraid I'm not a natural at the Freezing Spell.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10097": "Thank you. I've seen your Slowing Charm and the victim could outpace a Thestral.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10098": "Er, hence the aforementioned threat of fire!",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10099": "No. I tried though. Made some sort of sitting pillow. At least that's what I told Weasley when she sat on it.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10100": "Don't I know it. Received a Howler from my mother the very next day. Almost took me out of school altogether.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10101": "Said if I so much as looked at a hedgehog again she'd put me to work on a flower stall in Covent Garden.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10102": "Don't get too excited. I wouldn't be offering any special pricing. I might even charge more for you.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10103": "I should be so lucky.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10104": "No. I'd say you're in with the stall owner now.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10105": "I did see one though.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10106": "No. I was by myself.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10107": "She had big eyes. I wasn't particularly keen on the skin. Was a dead colour. I'd imagine sirens are a bit more appealing.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10108": "Not at all. That glass has stood 900 years without a crack. I'm sure it'll last till I leave here.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10109": "Most certainly.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10110": "I think she was hungry. Or that she liked my hair.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale2_10111": "No need to fear. Your secret's safe with me – on one condition.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale3_10000": "I don’t know why you don’t just get a Snitch from inside?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale3_10001": "I didn’t do anything, Madam –",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale5_10000": "Can’t see this being much good to a half-blood.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale5_10001": "What about you? What do you think?",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale5_10002": "<i>Incendio</i>.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale5_10003": "He’s a half-blood, sir.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale5_10004": "If you hadn’t being distracting me.",
  "T3StudentSlytherinMale6_10000": " Argh!",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10001": "Wait till you see the print; it's simply divine.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10002": "No. I didn't go with that one in the end. It's the one with the Occamy eggs. Hand-stitched with silver thread.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10003": "No. I went with the periwinkle. The red made me look too flushed. As if I'd been in an argument.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10004": "No. It quite drains me. As it turns out, I'd have done better to go with the red.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10005": "I'm simply saying I thought it was too much of a fuss.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10006": "A word of compassion would have sufficed. No need for your joining her wailing like a banshee.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10007": "What – is that supposed to mean?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10008": "Well. You're a one to talk. It's a wonder there was any Firewhisky left in the place. And we had spoken about that.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10009": "I should think your respects would have been more sincere had you not fallen into the trifle.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10010": "No one noticed? It's a wonder her father didn't follow the sound of the cacophony and find his way back.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10011": "Very partial to Muggle publications, I know that much.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10012": "Yes. Likely his experiences in Jamaica. From a Muggle town apparently, southeast of Kingston.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10013": "Yes, that's what I'd heard. And then his family took over Tomes and Scrolls when they came to Hogsmeade.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10015": "I'm simply saying I thought the display a little drab.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10016": "Precisely. Which is why I mentioned in passing that his shopfront wasn't entirely – enticing.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10017": "My expectations? I have no expectations of Ceridwen's Cauldrons other than they look mildly appealing.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10018": "I'm merely suggesting that perhaps the shopkeeper might spend a little time in dressing up their presentation.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10019": "Well. At least place a bit more foliage about them.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10020": "Wouldn't hurt him to have a few sprigs of aconite about the place, don't you think?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10021": "Oh, I don't know.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10025": "Oh I'm sure people have more brains than that.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10026": "Apparently she only uses 'fallen feathers'.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10027": "Yes. Must have a bit of a soft heart. Wouldn't have pegged her for that. Was quite surprised when she told me.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10028": "Oh I'm not sure I'd go as far as ruthless. That's a bit harsh.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10029": "I wonder if Scrivenshaft's has always been that way. Wouldn't bode well if there were some sort of 'blight'.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10030": "No but you said ruthless. And I'm saying – that's a bit harsh.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10031": "Nonsense. I noted it only in a whimsical fashion. You're exaggerating.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10032": "On birds. Let's say Fwoopers suddenly had stronger feather shafts; the shafts do link to the veins after all.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10033": "Well. They're not going to fall out then, are they? Then what's she going to do? She'd have to pluck them.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10034": "I'm simply saying I thought the owl looked a bit unwell.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10035": "I'm sure it doesn't stretch the mind much to imagine. Dishevelled wings. Eyes lacking sparkle. Unwell.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10036": "I might've known you'd take her side.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10037": "It doesn't matter.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10038": "I shouldn't have a peaky owl if I were running the post office.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10039": "Well. We shall see how long it takes your correspondence to arrive from your sister.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10040": "I'm sure it will. As long as you don't get that bird.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10041": "A fresh croissant with Shrivelfig jam could likely hold its own against a copy of Aquatic Wonders of Yorkshire.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10042": "Yes.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10043": "No.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10044": "Well I rather enjoyed my fresh croissant with an unexpected centre of meringue.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10045": "Oh yes, I go in all the time. Lovely rapport with the owner. Very friendly man.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10046": "Oh no. I'm not in the mood for it. Her shop's far too cluttered.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10047": "They were out of it the other day.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10048": "Likely the school's Herbology professor assigned some homework and their library wouldn't have enough copies.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10049": "Might what?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10050": "My neighbour's boy goes there.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10051": "And she told me he mentioned it.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10052": "Words to that effect.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10053": "May I mention something to you that's been on my mind for a while now?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10054": "No. He's stopped that now.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10055": "No. It's not that, and we're rid of them now.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10056": "It's you. It's your manner. You're always – awkward. I can never have a straightforward conversation with you.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10057": "'And' what?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10058": "I didn't say 'months'. Aren't you bothered? That people think of you as awkward?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10059": "It was heavier than I would've liked.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10060": "But for the odd occasion where I'd like to move it –",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10061": "I always clean, and on occasion I like to clean especially thoroughly. Which requires moving the cauldron.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10062": "Or perhaps there might be one of just that right weight. I'm thinking of taking a look at Ceridwen's.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10063": "We could move your set of goblets.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10064": "Well, if you want Bundimuns infesting the house because I can't clean under the cauldron then be it on you.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10065": "What? I beg your pardon?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10066": "Never mind, I didn't mean to have you fret. I shouldn't have mentioned.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10067": "Well, you're always so distracted. I shouldn't worry your head about it. What shall we have for dinner?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10068": "I am a witch. And I'm most offended that you should feel the need to ask. I'm utterly wounded. To the heart.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10069": "Fancy implying that I'm not a witch.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10070": "I'm sure I can find it in my heart to forgive you.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale1_10071": "Could you move our cauldron out of the way so we can make room for a new one?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10001": "Oh, I can only imagine. Fairies, was it?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10002": "Oh, how absolutely delightful. On the red silk, was it?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10003": "Oh, I see.  The periwinkle must be lovely on your complexion.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10004": "I'm sure she'd love some flowers. Why don't you pick her some bluebells?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10005": "Oh, well in that case, I know she's been on about getting herself a lining for her hat.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10006": "Oh no, she adores the one she has. But she has been mentioning how she wishes the lining repelled Dark Arts.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10007": "I thought just the same but I didn't like to say. Perhaps get her some of the lining, then?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10008": "Yes, you'll be able to have that by her birthday, I'm sure.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10009": "You'll just send an owl to Bulman's in Wolverton. They're very prompt.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10010": "Indeed. I'd probably also pick her some bluebells. She asked that I pass that on to you as well.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10011": "Muggle publications? At Thomas Brown's shop?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10012": "Ah yes, I recall now. Bakery, wasn't it? His family's trade?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10013": "Likely his parents hadn't much interest in cakes. I suppose books would be more stimulating to one's intellect.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10014": "I should imagine she'd always have room for an extra cauldron.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10015": "Very good idea. I should be happy if my husband bought me a spare cauldron.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10016": "Oh, of course. I'd be happy to share my own personal feelings on the matter.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10017": "Well. I like to brew my antidotes on a Monday, my Awakening Potions on a Tuesday –",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10018": "– and my Cure for Boils on a Saturday. Or on a Wednesday should the need arise.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10020": "Your wife likely wouldn't need to brew all of those. Although definitely the Cure for Boils.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10021": "What? What don't you know?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10026": "Now of course my cauldron is made of brass. Your wife might prefer a copper one perhaps?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10027": "I did, yes. Nothing to be ashamed of, boils. Can be hard to get snake fangs sometimes but you only need six.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10029": "Fallen feathers you say?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10030": "Mm. I'd agree. I always saw Ethel Wigley as more of the ruthless kind. This comes as quite a surprise.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10031": "I was only referring to her not coming across as particularly warm.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10032": "Yes well you were the one acting completely shocked over her 'soft heart'.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10033": "Anyway, one does have to wonder how long it takes her to collect the things? Imagine picking up all those feathers.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10034": "Blight? What do you mean, blight? Blight on whom?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10035": "Yes?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10036": "Poor things. Fancy plucking feathers from an innocent bird. Shouldn't be allowed. Don't know how she can do it.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10037": "I should imagine you can't go wrong with some Fizzing Whizzbees.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10038": "Ah, not a Fizzing Whizzbees sort of person then?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10039": "What about some Exploding Bonbons? Those are always good for a laugh.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10040": "Ah. Not an Exploding Bonbons sort of person then, is she?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10041": "I'm sure Mr Redding would be able to advise on something suitable. After all, there's a lot to choose from in his shop.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10042": "You must pay a visit to Honeydukes and speak with Mr Redding. I feel very confident that he'll find just the thing.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10043": "Oh? Eat a lot of Cauldron Cakes does she then?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10044": "Oh no. Not an untoward amount, of course. Perhaps just a little more than normal.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10045": "Oh. Perhaps some flowers then. What about Honking Daffodils?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10046": "Are you saying that a common confectionary is more interesting than the learnings to be found in – a book?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10047": "You don't think knowing the ways of a dangerous water demon might outweigh the delight of – a pastry?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10048": "I see. How very interesting. I rather enjoyed reading Aquatic Wonders of Yorkshire. Marvellous illustrations.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10049": "Ugh. Well you didn't say it had meringue.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10050": "Oh, likely you'll want to get some horned slugs and I like to keep a few Shrake spines on hand, for other brews.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10051": "Shall you be getting her the spare cauldron then?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10052": "Tomes and Scrolls? Out of One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi? That's surprising.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10053": "It might.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10054": "You said that their library wouldn't have enough copies and I can't help but wonder how you'd possibly know.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10055": "And?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10056": "He mentioned that they didn't have enough copies of One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10057": "Ah, so not specifically that.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10058": "Certainly. Please, what is it that's on your mind? Your husband still ruining the Sunday roast with <i>Incendio</i>?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10059": "Crup? Picked up fleas?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10060": "What is it then? Nothing serious I hope.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10061": "And?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10062": "Is that it? What's been on your mind for months now?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10063": "I find it wonderful. My mother always said, 'If you can't be nice, be memorable.' May she rest in peace.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10064": "It's a wonderful thing to have in the village. Hogsmeade is very fortunate to have its own cauldron shop.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10065": "I always enjoy a trip to London.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10066": "About every five years.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10067": "As often as I'm inclined.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10068": "Have you been down there yourself? To the Ceridwen's in Diagon Alley?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10069": "How many years?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10070": "Well then. Seems you're not terrifically inclined either.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10071": "I agree. I'd be shocked if two ladies ever share a carriage, the size of those skirts. Enough to suffocate you.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale2_10072": "Of course, if it's a special occasion.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10000": "Run!",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10005": "The fragrance is most enchanting. Not your typical common violets, I bet.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10006": "He doesn't like it.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10007": "She could get some for your wife, next time she's in London. Couldn't you?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10008": "Told you he doesn't like it.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10009": "No harm in speaking the truth. She won't need the infirmary to hear you don't like it.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10010": "I'm sure she didn't mean anything by it.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10011": "Very nice. Lovely girl.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10012": "If you mention anything regarding potion recipes. She can get a little –",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10013": "Oh yes, the mere mention of Faris Spavin and you might as well set up camp for the night.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10014": "Darling.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10015": "Never seen such an unruly garden. It's a wonder we're not overrun with gnomes.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10016": "What?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10017": "Well I never. Etched an eye, you say.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10018": "That does sound rather untoward, doesn't it.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10019": "An eye, you say?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10020": "Well. I shall be keeping my windows clean.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10021": "An eye you say?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10022": "Most untoward.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10023": "Likely it was made with some sort of inferior material. Not from Ollivanders of course.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10025": "Well certainly it was no fault of Mr Ollivander. The man cares more about wands than anyone I've ever known.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10026": "I wonder how she broke it.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10027": "Not surprised in the least. I can't see a dragon heartstring wand choosing her. More likely she bought it on a trip.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10028": "Never seen so many brooms. It's a wonder there are any trees left in Britain.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10033": "She was asking me a question. Yes, they looked to be the expensive type. I saw at least two Yew Weavers.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10034": "Ahem. Aren't I explaining a tale about my neighbours and their never-ending obsession with collecting brooms?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10036": "Very rude to suggest such a thing.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10038": "Does he think I don't care for my friends? That I would invite them over to play common tricks on them?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10039": "Piping hot.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10040": "Well I most certainly don't find them amusing. Not in the slightest. Fancy offering them up to me like that.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10046": "Then perhaps you might refrain from introducing such unnecessary tales as careless spills in your kitchen.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10047": "Well, the young one only walked right by me with a Silver Arrow under each arm. What? What's the matter?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10050": "The man must think I have no friends.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10051": "Stink Pellets. My neighbours insist upon stacking brooms up the side of my house. I'm putting a stop to it.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10053": "Likely she saw an advertisement in the <i>Daily Prophet</i>.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10054": "Quite a coincidence though, isn't it, buying the identical dress to you?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10055": "Oh, he might not take kindly to that. Having words.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10056": "Not to mention, what if he tells her? He might find the inclination to report your having words with him.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10057": "I'd say you want to be very delicate in this matter. You don't want people to talk.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10058": "I would. If it were me.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10059": "And then simply make sure you go about your business in such a way as to not cross paths with her.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10060": "Yes.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10061": "May I just say something?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10062": "I don't like that dress at all.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10063": "Never seen so much tea. You'd think he'd cleared out every last leaf from Steepley's.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10064": "If I were Mrs Steepley I wouldn't encourage the young ones to drink tea.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10065": "Stains. If they spill it.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10066": "Still. She's always very friendly, Prudence Steepley. Too much for a widow if you ask me.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10067": "He did. But it's the respect isn't it? It's about honouring his memory.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10068": "I'm not one to judge. Merely noting that she's a very friendly woman. That's all.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10069": "Oh. I don't think it's that. No. I think he just likes tea.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10070": "Very rude to mention.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10071": "You should've seen the look on his face. You'd have thought I was walking about with dragon dung around my neck.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10072": "He didn't say anything. It was his look.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10073": "I see. We were just saying how rude it was of Patrick Redding to imply that my scent was overtly pungent.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10074": "Indeed. A look that spoke volumes it was.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10075": "It said, 'Get out of my shop with your stench of regional violets.'",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10076": "Didn't need to. I tell you this, it'll be at least a week before I set foot back in that man's shop.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10077": "Yes, she is rather heavy handed with a wand; that wouldn't surprise me at all.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10078": "Forgive me, but are we no longer hearing a tale of my broom gathering neighbours? Did you not have interest?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10079": "I see. Well. There you have it. I can see the air in my lungs is wasted here. I shall save my tales for another day.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10080": "(sigh)",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10081": "Yes, I think we see your point. For him to think that. When I'm so kind. And considerate. And caring.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10082": "You'd think if an incompetent witch like that can have a wand we'd at least let goblins have them.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10083": "Is it rude to talk behind her back in this manner? We're not being impolite in any way are we?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10084": "Well, I for one shan't be going round for tea again. Not at her house.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10085": "Conniving I'd call it.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10086": "You wouldn't have wished you'd been there if you saw how much tea spilt on the floor.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10087": "Yes. It was on my dress.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10088": "Yes. It did. Most uncomfortable.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10089": "Well it should, I can tell you that much.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10090": "Oh yes I bought him Hiccough Sweets, Frog Spawn Soap and Stink Pellets.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10091": "If it wasn't for my respites at the Three Broomsticks I should think I'd have left the village altogether.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10098": "I had been drawn to the Thestral hair.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10099": "Made of Thestral hair you mean? Like the Elder Wand? I'm very familiar with my wandlore.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10100": "I do always like a stroll about a nice cemetery when I get the chance.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10101": "Yes Mr Ollivander said as much. Nonetheless I was drawn to it.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10102": "He did. Whilst reminding me constantly that it's the wand that chooses the witch.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10103": "Well. First it knocked down some shelves and then it singed the edge of Mr Ollivander's trousers. At the hem.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10104": "No. I would have, except it shot out the front door when a customer came in and it didn't come back.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10105": "Not while I was there, no.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10106": "Oh most do. Something special though, being drawn to death. Takes just that right sort of person. Not to worry.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10107": "Because the toad found its way to my house. I simply haven't had the chance to return it yet.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10108": "Your neighbours still don't compare to mine for disruptiveness. One of them's only taken up bagpipes.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10109": "Says his cousin's a Squib. Attends Muggle events. Musical ones. Apparently quite good at playing them.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10110": "Sirona told me he's taking the bagpipes quite seriously as well, my neighbour. She says he's fancying to start a choir.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10111": "Not with a whining banshee playing in the background. Have you heard those things? Worse than Mandrakes.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10112": "She says I should take up bagpipes.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10113": "I have my first lesson tomorrow at four in the afternoon.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10114": "Right next door.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10115": "No no no. Don't let them take me.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10116": "You're worrying far too much. Nobody's looking at you!",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10117": "Novelty socks at that price can't be passed up. Be thankful you have socks.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10118": "You're not dancing. You're exercising.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10119": "I've never known someone so dramatic, just like your father. Anyone'd think you had an affliction!",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10120": "When you pay for your own socks then you get to choose.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10121": "Until then you'll learn to be thrifty. And behave. You're starting to cause a scene.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10122": "She's gone. Niamh's dead.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale5_10123": "I can't believe she's dead.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10001": "Get to safety!",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10003": "You always look very smart. It's been a while though, hasn't it. Since you bought something new from Gladrags.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10004": "Get yourself a new pair of shoes. Not Mokeskin ones, mind. Just something – presentable.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10005": "Perhaps a new overcoat?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10006": "But you'll want to be a bit fashionable, won't you. For the times.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10007": "Oh, of course you are. I wasn't suggesting otherwise.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10008": "Perhaps Calliope Snelling could style your hair for you? Give it a little trim.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10009": "Oh, I'm sure she did. Not a word comes out of her mouth that isn't carved like the tooth of a Basilisk.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10010": "Oh yes. Golden.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10011": "Stern. Yes, she can. Or the Ministry.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10012": "Absolute gem.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10013": "Let alone the windows. It's a wonder they can even see out.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10014": "What do you mean, etched an eye?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10015": "I don't like the sound of that. Don't like the sound of it at all.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10016": "Yes, I wondered if he'd said, 'Etched an eye' too.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10017": "You shan't be the only one.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10018": "Most untoward.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10019": "Oh no, Mr Ollivander would never use any sort of inferior material.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10021": "I agree. I should think a phoenix would be proud to have a feather in a wand crafted by Garrick Ollivander.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10022": "Yes, that's much more likely.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10023": "Why would they need so many brooms, do you think? Your neighbours?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10024": "It's the ones next door. She already said that.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10025": "Were they the expensive ones would you say? I'm assuming they'd all be from Spintwitches.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10027": "Yes, I recall you mentioning the Yew Weavers. I remember the day. I'd just had a little spillage in my kitchen.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10029": "She stands her ground that woman, I'll give her that.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10030": "She means that Sirona holds genuine concern for her patrons. She'd put herself in front of danger if it came to it.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10031": "Oh, I'm very relieved. I would hate for you to have thought that I would say what you were going to say.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10032": "No, of course. Had it been deliberate then obviously we'd have an entirely different matter on our hands.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10038": "Yes. Very keen to hear more about that.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10042": "Or perhaps Mr Hill mentioned it to her the last time she was in.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10043": "I agree. I think she admires your style and she's outright copying it.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10044": "You might upset the man. You'd be hard pressed to find such lovely clothes anywhere else. Not in Hogsmeade.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10045": "Ooh no. Nothing worse than people talking. No, you don't want that.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10046": "Yes. I would monitor her activities, in such a way as to be discreet of course.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10047": "That would be wise I'd say. Then you'll completely escape any possibility of embarrassment and humiliation.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10048": "She's right. Makes your complexion look like you've had a run-in with a Dementor.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10049": "I overheard him in there the other day, talking with Mrs Steepley.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10050": "Tea.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10051": "Discussing which ones the children like the most. Sweet apparently.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10052": "Oh? Why is that?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10053": "It is her trade though. In all fairness.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10054": "Hmm. I think thirty years is enough time to grieve - don't you think?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10055": "Probably about time though, isn't it?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10056": "It's a little out of date, isn't it?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10057": "Not many these days still have Horntails embossed on their envelopes.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10058": "People these days are mostly going for the Hebridean Black I'd say.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10059": "You really should.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10060": "Yes, Ethel at the quill shop. Goodness I haven't been in Scrivenshaft's for ages. Yes, she could put you right.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10061": "If you say so.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10062": "Well. If you change your mind, pop into Scrivenshaft's and Ethel'll put you right.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10063": "Oh, I don't think he'd do that. Not Mr Ollivander. No, the wand was likely mistreated. Perhaps sustained a blow.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10064": "Oh yes, of course. I didn't mean to derail the wagon so to speak. Please, carry on.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10065": "Oh, it was a beautiful brew. I'd had it on for hours, just at a simmer, how you do. Then I left it and it boiled over, didn't it?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10066": "I know. Ugh, and it took me all next day to clean it up off the floor. Very hard to get out, stains from Giant Purple Toads.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10067": "Oh, well it's not up to me, is it? What about yourself? Which tale would you prefer to hear about?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10068": "Fancy them having such a large amount of brooms though – and bringing them all into the house?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10069": "Oh I believe they do. Four children I believe she'd told us last time. Three girls and a boy. Lovely number, four.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10070": "Oh, I didn't know you were going to say that. I wouldn't have said it otherwise.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10072": "A very different matter.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10073": "Very true. Surely there's some fine print in the Code of Wand Use that would prevent her from having one.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10074": "No. Not at all.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10075": "I don't blame you. You won't catch me there either. Not after what she bought from that blasted shop.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10076": "Amusement? I don't call startling a fellow witch with a Nose-Biting Teacup amusement. Devious is more like it.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10077": "And on your dress you'd said.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10078": "Went right through to your bloomers you said.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10079": "I wonder if we shouldn't report her to Ruth Singer?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10080": "Imagine, a grown woman buying such a thing, and for such untoward purposes. What is the world coming to?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10081": "Ah, how very thoughtful.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10082": "Awful to have bad neighbours. One never knows.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10086": "Sprightly though, isn't he?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10087": "Carries some exquisite brooms.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10088": "Well, he had one in his shop window the other month; a Wind Wisp I believe it was. What a handsome broom.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10089": "I admire craftsmanship. And quality. I think it's tremendous what that young man has done with that shop.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10090": "Oh, I think you're not wrong there. Well, anyone would be lucky to have that young man on their arm.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10091": "Oh yes. I think his companion was here from Wales doing some research but he had to go back. Such a shame.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10093": "Heavens. Have you reported them?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10094": "Didn't someone in your lane say they'd had a toad disappear? What if it's the Ridgeback? The baby, feeding?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10095": "How can you be so certain?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10096": "Nooo!",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10097": "Oh, that could be nice. More people to sing Christmas carols.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10098": "Did Sirona mention anything else? She usually has some good advice to offer.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10099": "Oh. And shall you then? Take up the bagpipes?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10100": "Oh. And where shall you be having those then?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10101": "Thinking about it, a broom from Albie would be a lovely gift for my nephew. Perhaps a Wind Wisp?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10102": "Mm, yes. You have a point. Perhaps a new quill might be more suitable. It's always nice to see Ethel Wigley.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10103": "Mm, yes. I think you're right. I think I shall just take some nice parchment for him to write on.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10104": "And what would you be suggesting then, pray tell?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10105": "In all fairness the coal was likely enchanted.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10106": "Perhaps a bit of coal then?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10107": "How could this happen?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10108": "I refuse to leave.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10109": "We won't be the same without her.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale6_10110": "May her memory be a treasure to us forever.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10000": "Ah, but he's marvellously strapping. You'd not meet a finer Seeker.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10001": "Well, I took my son to Queerditch Marsh when he was an infant and I can tell you I had the right place.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10002": "Even found a strip of leather, likely from one of the first ever Quaffles; although my husband did say it was a deceased hen.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10003": "No, you'll see. Mark my words, there'll be a Quidditch World Cup where my boy's name is sung to the rafters.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10004": "Mm. If I've mind to speak the truth, I'd prefer my boy be kept away from your daughter.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10005": "It's rumoured her skills concerning a broom amount to little less than Shuntbumps.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10006": "I see the toadstool doesn't leap far from the patch.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10007": "I'm sure she'll come around. It's just a difficult age, isn't it.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10008": "Perhaps she's fancying herself a bit of a writer?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10009": "Oh, lovely. And how did she like that?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10010": "Well. I'm sure your daughter's going to be a fine young witch.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10011": "Well, yours is a very nice hedge.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10012": "You're very fortunate it took so well.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10013": "Is that what you're using for your hedge, then?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10014": "How about that.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10015": "Don't you get the birds though? Going after the worms?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10016": "Ah, but you've got that hedge.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10017": "I'd be thrilled to have a good hedge.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10018": "Ah, yes. That'd do it.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10019": "It was a whiff of smoke.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10020": "Taking liberties with the truth, as always.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10021": "You said you were caught in the fire of a Streeler whilst rescuing a lost boy.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10022": "You haven't heard of it because a Streeler carousing by the Mersey has never happened. Not in my lifetime.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10023": "Ah, the truth comes out!",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10024": "The plot thickens!",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10025": "What is it then? And I won't accept being spun a yarn.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10026": "If it were my son, I wouldn't be letting him sit guzzling Butterbeers till all hours.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10033": "Likely she's just seen you and your wife using yours and she wants to be like her parents.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10037": "I've only ever had a copper cauldron.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10038": "Oh.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10045": "I did hear that someone had reported him though.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10046": "One could point the finger at Zonko's of course. Although when I think about it, no; it really was your son's fault.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10047": "I do believe I was in that class.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10048": "One of your frogs jumped all over my exercise book. And I'd done a beautiful drawing of a bat spleen.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10052": "Well, there can be a certain change of customer about that time.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10053": "Well. More of an adult crowd generally. After six o'clock.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10054": "Nonetheless I wouldn't want my son to be swigging back Butterbeers the way her boy does. He's like a fish.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10055": "What if it does? My son already has a portly stance. And I tell him to go for a good walk, but will he?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10056": "He simply looks at me as if I'd been Confunded and then gazes over to his broom.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10063": "There. If this gentleman said 'Oh', I'm sure you wouldn't be accusing him of being unkind.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10065": "Very well. Since you are so persistent on demanding that I conduct a lecture on cauldron variations.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10069": "I feel he's earned it so I don't mind.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10070": "Just because there is no Quidditch season at this time doesn't mean my son isn't practising.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10071": "Oh, not my lad. I took him to Gladrags last week and I said, 'You can have anything you'd like.'",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10072": "Well. I'm not saying you can scrape a few Knuts together and come out with some rare bit of kit.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10073": "But I'm sure there'd be something. I do admire Augustus. Truly an exceptional crafter of garments.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10074": "Oh, just a handkerchief. Second-hand I think.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10075": "It's just a stage they go through; that's all it is. I wouldn't worry.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10076": "Oh my, my. The truth comes out.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10077": "Go on then. Let's hear it, this truth.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10078": "Aaah, that's nice. I had one of those. Lovely it was.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10079": "Oh, I never would have guessed you a thief.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10080": "Well I say.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10081": "How awful.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10082": "I don't know what she puts in her brews, do I?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10083": "Oh. You could read those.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10084": "You shall. Don't know what you might learn. I always have a good ponder over my tea leaves.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10085": "What, when you were done your tea? A Crup? In the tea leaves?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10086": "Wouldn't have been a Crup, that wouldn't. What you saw was the Grim.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10087": "I knew it. I told you, didn't I? That was the Grim. What a shame.  Was it an old fish?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10088": "Stop pressing him about his fish. He's grieving.  Don't you worry. I'm sure you'll find another one.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10090": "Oh. I doubt you'll find one like that.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10091": "It was just a bit hard, that's all.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10092": "Can't say I have either. Perhaps you just weren't in the right mood.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10093": "Oh no one's questioning what happened, no. Perhaps though – it was your frame of mind?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10094": "I'm not one to take sides but I will say that I normally bite into mine quite delicately.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10095": "I beg your pardon. How dare you call my son a sloth?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10096": "My son is the furthest thing from slothfulness. He simply doesn't place emphasis – on moving.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10097": "Well, I didn't say I didn't enjoy a night-time Butterbeer.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10099": "Don't be absurd. There was nothing unkindly about it. You're far too sensitive.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10100": "Brass will brew a potion more slowly than copper.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10101": "Oh? And what shall you be speaking to him about?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10102": "Oh. Shall you? I shall be sure to alert him of this imminent interrogation.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10103": "I will.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10104": "Yes. Always. Makes all the difference in the world.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10105": "Well I was a marvellous drawer. I could get them just at the right proportions.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10106": "Lovely to hear and kind of you to say. If you make a wrong turn of the quill they can look a bit like a dragon liver.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10107": "Oh?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10108": "You wouldn't.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10109": "Hmph. I can see you haven't changed.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10110": "Give her some time. She'll have her own wand soon enough and there'll be no need to worry.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10111": "Oh. Oh that's not good. You'll have problems with that one.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10112": "I think it's lovely that she's so eager. That's a fine witch in the making, that is.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10113": "I'd been over to Brood and Peck the other day.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10114": "I had wanted a word with her about some Puffskein hair I'd bought last week.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10116": "Wants to be a Seeker and who am I to guide him otherwise?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10117": "What might appear to you to be simply guzzling beverages is in fact a highly valuable part of my son's life.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10118": "Sirona. Was a highly regarded Seeker when she was in school.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10119": "I must disagree. You should see how much she's taught him. She'll use bags of salt as Bludgers. You'd be surprised.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10120": "When my son plays, you'll know it's no sacks of flower he's facing. Sirona's taught him how to think on a broom.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10121": "That would be a nice thought. In the meantime, let's hope that irresponsible headmaster gets hit by a sack of flour.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10122": "They were outside of Ollivanders, just down the street from the Three Broomsticks. That's where I saw them.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10123": "Oh, how fascinating. Perhaps an inclination towards Divination?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10124": "What a thoughtful girl.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10125": "The high street can get busy. It's not hard for a child to lose their bearings.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10126": "Well. At least there's a bright side.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10127": "No. But at least you'll know to go straight to Ollivanders next time.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10128": "Yes. I had felt the hair to be a little knotted.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10129": "Yes. Knotted.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10130": "Well I had thought to myself, perhaps I'll just give it a little brush.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10131": "Oh, she was lovely. Such a feisty one, Ellie. You'd never believe the beasts she's encountered.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10132": "I doubt there's one she hasn't! Oh, we did have a laugh. There was this  and she  –",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10133": "She had nettles out the back and she found a nest of Glumbumbles, and they –  never mind.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10134": "Well. It was a long time ago she said. She'd collected some of the treacle, what the Glumbumbles make.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10135": "No. She didn't take it. She baked it into a Cauldron Cake and sent it as a gift to the proprietor of Zonko's.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10136": "Apparently, he'd played one too many tricks on her, Stink Pellets she said, and she wanted to get him back.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10137": "Oh. Nothing really. Didn't ask her about it in the end, we were having such a laugh. Still, nice quality hair I must say.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10138": "I did see you through the window. Nothing to be embarrassed about.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10139": "There you are, he was merely looking for a sturdy broom. Nothing to be ashamed of there.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10140": "Yes, I did notice there was a little rearrangement in the window during the incident.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10141": "Now, now. It's not nice to make fun of those less fortunate.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10142": "Oh well, if you're going to be like that. An Erumpent could handle a broom better than you.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10143": "Oh, you'd be surprised. Augustus Hill caters for all. Even the lowest. Of budgets I mean.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale8_10144": "But then I thought, no. Why should I? Not when I paid full price. So I'd gone over there and had a word over it.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10000": "No, I'm sure they're not. And they say only especially delicate violets are used. What do you think of it?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10001": "My new perfume? What do you think of it?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10002": "Kind of you to say. I found it at a little shop on Bond Street on my last trip.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10003": "Oh, I'd be delighted to.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10004": "Oh. Oh, I see.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10005": "You really ought to.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10006": "Oh, that'll be nice.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10007": "Oh, that'd be very nice, a new overcoat. Not that there's anything wrong with your current overcoat.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10008": "Oh, very nice to see a fashionable man. I always say: very nice to see a fashionable man.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10009": "Oh, she'd never be implying that you weren't with the times.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10010": "Nice person though, isn't she.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10011": "Still. Very sweet otherwise.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10012": "It's just –",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10013": "The wand might have been from Ollivanders, you don't know. Perhaps he slipped in some Kelpie hair.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10014": "Broke what? The wand? I think it was more that it was 'misbehaving' than some sort of splintering or breakage.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10015": "Now that I think of it, she told me that the core of her wand was dragon heartstring. Such a show off.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10016": "Very rude. Don't you agree?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10017": "I was saying, the owner of Zonko's was presenting suggestions and they thought she might have liked the cups.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10018": "Mm, I can see how that would result in embarrassment. And humiliation.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10019": "Not to mention the burns.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10021": "Oh, Sirona's not after the money. It's about pride for her. She thrives on the responsibility of the Three Broomsticks.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10022": "Yes. That's what I was going to say. She wouldn't see anyone harmed, not on her premises.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10024": "An entirely different matter.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10031": "Yes. The Nose-Biting Teacups.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10034": "Or – it could be merely a coincidence and she happened to be in Gladrags the same day as me.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10035": "A telltale? Mr Hill? I should certainly hope not. Although I won't say I disagree with your concern.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10036": "What nerve. Warrants my having a word with Augustus Hill so that we ensure this doesn't happen again.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10037": "Well, what am I supposed to do? Go about the village trying to avoid her lest we're wearing the same garment?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10038": "Spy – is what you're saying?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10039": "Mm. Very well. I shall be covert in my actions.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10040": "Yes of course. What is it?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10041": "I see. Well, thank you both for sharing your – observations. I think I'd best stay clear of Gladrags altogether.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10042": "Very rude. Don't you agree?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10043": "Were you then?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10044": "Stung by a Billywig?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10045": "Is that all you can say? Our friend was insulted by our local shopkeeper.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10046": "I hope you said something. Your scent's delightful. Beautiful fragrance.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10047": "Always the look that gives it away.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10048": "Uh! The nerve.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10049": "She's referring to your stationery.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10050": "I hadn't liked to mention myself.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10051": "I hadn't wanted to mention myself.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10052": "Yes. That's what I have. The Hebridean Black.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10053": "Ethel Wigley could put you right I'm sure.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10054": "From the tea. It'd be piping hot.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10055": "He must really, mustn't he? Must think you're a very sorry old thing. Miserable and all by yourself at home.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10056": "I didn't mean to imply there was any harm in you saying what I was going to say. I didn't mean that.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10057": "I'm fond of Zonko's personally. Life can always use some amusement.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10058": "I find it quite funny the idea that a teacup would nip your nose.  Wish I'd been there to see it.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10059": "I'd hardly say playing a trick from Zonko's qualifies as a crime.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10060": "Isn't it her son's birthday next week? Turns nine doesn't he? Are you getting him anything?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10061": "Oh. Likely you must have a strong affinity with death.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10062": "Mm, I thought as much.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10063": "Supposed to be very difficult to handle, a wand core of Thestral hair.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10064": "And did he let you then? Have a go with one?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10065": "But if she was drawn to it, likely Mr Ollivander would want her to try it.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10066": "Oh goodness. I suppose you didn't purchase it then?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10067": "Oh how exciting. My wand's dragon heartstring core and laurel wood. I'm envious now. I wish I was drawn to death.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10068": "I bet his mother's proud.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10069": "To have a lad so young running a shop in Hogsmeade. I should think it's quite an accomplishment.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10070": "He's rather popular. In the village. I believe it's not only the brooms that have admirers.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10071": "I used to see him walking with another charming young gentleman. Very handsome couple.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10072": "He's not short of suitors, our Albie. Likely too busy with his shop now for romance.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10074": "Oh that's an excellent broom.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10075": "Isn't that the nephew who has a lot of accidents? The one that tripped on the Horklumps and almost lost an eye?",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10076": "I'm still not sure. From what I've heard of your nephew he might accidentally stab himself with a good quill.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10077": "Much better idea.",
  "T3TownspersonFemale9_10078": "Not deliberately.",
  "T3TownspersonMale13_10000": "I told you not to go down that path!",
  "T3TownspersonMale13_10001": "You could've got us in a lot of trouble.",
  "T3TownspersonMale13_10002": "Never mind. I'll fix it. As always.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10001": "Too much of a fuss? My dear, it was only the day before that her father had been led to his demise by a Hinkypunk.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10002": "I did not wail like a banshee and I take significant affront to the suggestion.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10003": "Besides, you seemed happily occupied with the roast lamb.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10004": "A mere observation. One would think that rather than a time of grieving, it was a celebration of mint sauce.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10005": "I was merely having a dram to show my respects.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10006": "That was a slip and no one noticed.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10007": "I was thinking more along the lines of a surprise purchase. It is a special birthday after all.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10008": "A lining for her hat? Well that sounds rather ordinary. Why don't I simply buy her a new hat?",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10009": "Repelled Dark Arts? That sounds rather paranoid?",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10010": "Well. I suppose if that's what she wants.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10011": "If that's what makes her happy. I was most determined to ensure that the gift be a surprise.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10012": "Oh, I wouldn't say drab. Only so much colour one can bring to an assembly of cauldrons, isn't there?",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10013": "I'm not sure how one makes a shop of cauldrons enticing. Seems the issue lies more with your expectations.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10015": "My point exactly. You're seeking some sort of excitement from a collection of cast iron pots.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10016": "Oh? And what might you suggest?",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10017": "Foliage? The man's selling cauldrons not Herbology specimens.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10018": "Yes, I thought it was a good idea myself.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10019": "Oh really. May I ask why? I'd like to understand the notion of it, before I buy one you understand.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10020": "Wonderful. Much appreciated I'm sure. Very well, please – enlighten me.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10021": "Yes –",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10023": "But then you'd have people asking the poor man how much for his sprigs of aconite.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10024": "I think you're overestimating our youth of today. Why does this bother you so much? Do you even go into his shop?",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10025": "Oh. I see.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10026": "I see.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10027": "I – forgive me, but did you allude to my wife having a need for – a Cure for Boils?",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10028": "This has been extraordinarily helpful. I can't thank you enough. Truly.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10030": "Seemed perfectly fine to me. I'm not sure I'd know what an unwell owl would look like come to think of it.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10031": "I highly doubt Lottie Featherbottom would be putting unwell owls to work at the post office.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10032": "I'm not taking her side, I'm merely stating what is most likely fact.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10033": "There's no need to be like that. Think of it logically: an owl that may fall ill during its duties, well, it's a liability, isn't it?",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10034": "I really think you're looking far too deeply into this. It was a perfectly healthy bird.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10035": "I'm sure her postcard will arrive in a perfectly timely manner.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10036": " Remind us to never speak of this again.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10037": "Oh no. She's not that sort of person at all.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10038": "No.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10039": "Oh dear, no. No, my wife has a more – serene temperament. No, no, nothing exploding would work at all.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10040": "No. No definitely not.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10041": "Mm. Yes, I could ask what he'd recommend for someone with a serene temperament.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10042": "I suppose there's always Cauldron Cakes. Just seems so – routine.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10043": "A fair amount, yes. Not an untoward amount you understand.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10044": "Possibly, y – no, and frankly I'm off the entire idea of sweets from Honeydukes.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10045": "Oh good heavens, no. Never mind. I'm serious. I shall just wait for our next anniversary.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10046": "Perhaps we'll pop into Steepley's shall we? Have a spot of tea?",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10047": "No. Most certainly not.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10048": "Sturdy. That's what you want in a cauldron.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10049": "I don't recall 'occasions' where moving a cauldron was deemed necessary.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10050": "Oh. I see. Well, better too heavy than too light.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10051": "We've hardly room for two cauldrons now, have we?",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10052": "I'd rather we not. I enjoy seeing them on the side; far more than I'd enjoy seeing another cauldron.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10053": "Isn't the obvious solution that you levitate the cauldron for your 'especially thorough' clean?",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10054": "Yes, certainly saves the trip to London.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10055": "Oh? How often do you go?",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10056": "Oh. I see. Not terrifically often then.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10057": "Oh yes of course.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10058": "I have. Some years back.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10059": "Oh goodness, must be about six or seven I should say.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10060": "No, I suppose not. Too busy for me down there. Can't move for carriages and frocks.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10061": "You'll hear no complaints from me having to wear a top hat. I'm most sympathetic.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10062": "Of course.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10063": "I don't know why we're even having this discussion. Why aren't you simply using <i>Levioso</i> on your cauldron?",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10064": "No, since we're speaking on this, I don't know that I've ever seen you levitate anything.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10065": "Now you're changing the subject. Let's have this out in the open once and for all: are you a witch or aren't you?",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10066": "No need to be wounded. It's a logical question given the circumstances.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10067": "I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. Forgive me.",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10068": "Thank you. What can I do to make it up to you?",
  "T3TownspersonMale1_10069": "Of course.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10001": " Beg your pardon?",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10002": "Oh, uh (cough) Mm, very good. Yes, it's a very good smell. Scent.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10003": "What? No! Nonsense! Oh It's delightful. A lovely, er, odour. (cough) Suits you. (cough)",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10004": "Heaven's, no.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10005": "No, no  it's – intoxicating. As you say, enchanting. (cough)",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10006": "What? Yes, I suppose it has. Ought to pay a little visit to Augustus one of these days, I suppose.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10007": "Yes. Well, I suppose I will.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10008": "Yes, well, next time I'm passing I shall stop in.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10009": "I should hope not. It's a perfectly good overcoat. Very hardy.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10010": "I believe I am a fashionable man. I am with the times.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10011": "Last time I passed by, someone had etched an eye on it.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10012": "In the dirt. Likely some young scallywag thinking themselves clever. Etched an eye right in the filth on the window.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10013": "Yes. Etched an eye.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10014": "Yes. An eye.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10015": "I'd highly recommend it.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10016": "Is it the ones across the street you're talking about? Or the ones next door?",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10017": "Oh. ",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10019": "Oh, Albie Weekes has some fine brooms. I always enjoy a visit to Spintwitches.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10021": "What? Er sorry – I'm afraid I was briefly distracted. I had thought someone was calling to me.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10022": "The cups?",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10023": "Oh, I've always found Nose-Biting Teacups tremendously amusing.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10026": "Yes, she's most amiable.  Although I suppose I'd be amiable if someone was giving me money.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10027": "How so?",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10032": "I would like to know what happened. In her kitchen.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10034": "Burns?",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10035": "Oh yes, of course.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10041": "Oh yes? What about?",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10042": "Oh yes. And what was he saying then? About tea?",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10043": "Is that so? Interesting.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10044": "Ah. Yes of course.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10045": "Oh? Why do you say that? I thought her husband passed away decades ago.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10046": "Perhaps this neighbour of yours is the needy sort. Might require dealings with overly friendly people.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10047": "What? Er – my sincerest apologies I thought I was being stung by a Billywig. Agree with what?",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10048": "What?",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10049": " No, it was, er – merely my cuff. Chipped button; I had meant to mend it.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10050": "Oh.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10051": "What was it he actually said then? Mr Redding?",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10052": "His look.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10053": "I see. And  what did this look – say?",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10054": "But he didn't actually – say – anything?",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10055": "What were you saying? About time for what?",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10056": "My stationery? What about my stationery?",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10057": "What could possibly be out of date about stationery? It's paper.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10058": "What's wrong with an embossed Horntail? Very regal I think. Majestic.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10059": "Well, I'm sure one of these days when I run out of my current stationery I shall consider a change of design.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10060": "I don't need putting right. I have stationery marked with the most dangerous dragon in the world.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10061": "I'm very content with my parchment, my envelopes and my embossed Hungarian Horntails.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10062": "I truly despair sometimes. Truly.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10063": "How very unfortunate. And after all those hours you tended it.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10064": "The spillage.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10065": "Most extraordinary I should say. I'm guessing they may have a rather large family.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10066": "Oh. A spillage?",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10067": "What was it you were in there for anyway? In Zonko's?",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10068": "Well, this has been a delight. I shall look forward to escaping to the Three Broomsticks at my first opportunity.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10069": "I swear our neighbours are harbouring the egg of a Norwegian Ridgeback in their back garden.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10075": "Remarkable to have a wand with such a core.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10076": "Yes. Apparently from the tail is best. They say the holder is unbeatable in a duel.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10077": "Surely it would be unsafe to try such a wand in the shop? I mean, one with such an unpredictable temperament.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10078": "Well? What happened then, when you tried this wand with the Thestral hair core.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10079": "Didn't come back?",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10080": "Yes, well it makes sense working with athletic goods.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10081": "Who, Albie Weekes's mother?",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10082": "I've never heard brooms described as 'exquisite'.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10083": "Oh, exquisite and handsome. An admirer of the Wind Wisp, are we?",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10085": "Yes. They simply said to keep an eye out for flames.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10086": "No. My neighbours had nothing to do with the disappearance of the toad; I'm sure of it.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10087": "Ugh, how untoward. Must be like living next to Fwoopers.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10088": "Yes, there was a student in his shop the other day having a hover about on one. Seemed to have a lot of steam to it.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10089": "How utterly boring.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10090": "I wouldn't buy him anything. Children have enough to play with these days. Used to be a lump of coal in my day.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10091": "Only to burn a bit longer in the fire.",
  "T3TownspersonMale2_10092": "Grand idea.",
  "T3TownspersonMale5_10000": "Death is coming!",
  "T3TownspersonMale5_10126": "I should have run when I could. I'd be free by now.",
  "T3TownspersonMale5_10127": "Poor Niamh. Gone so young.",
  "T3TownspersonMale5_10128": "Dear, sweet Niamh. Dead.",
  "T3TownspersonMale5_10129": "I need to get out of here. Don't take me! Argh! I'm not her! I'm not her!",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10003": "The village is lost! We must flee!",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10006": "I couldn't agree more. When my son was nine he could spot a Billywig a mile away. It's an eye like that you want.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10007": "Oh dear, that sounds untoward.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10008": "How foul.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10009": "How ungrateful.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10010": "A whiff of smoke? I was almost burned alive.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10011": "I saved the child's life! And it was the River Mersey.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10012": "You wouldn't catch me dead fishing in the Thames. They're still dredging up rats from the Black Plague.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10013": "That is exactly right.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10014": "I saved the child's life and I shall not hear otherwise.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10015": "Very well. There was no fishing. And no Streeler. But I was sat near the lake for a bit and I did get a bit of a chill.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10016": "A brochure?",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10017": "Not subtle, no. Not with a brochure.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10018": "Seems to be the case, doesn't it.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10019": "What? What is it?",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10020": "Threat of a hex is a little excessive for this discourse, wouldn't you say?",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10021": "Change of customer? What do you mean?",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10024": "She was in the kitchen the other day; sneaking my wand from my coat. I've never been so grateful for the Trace.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10027": "Since when is Frog Spawn Soap anyone's fault? It's an amusing trick that every one of us had as a child.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10032": "Albie? At the broom shop?",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10036": "I don't see as that's of any concern at the Three Broomsticks. Not the sort of place that attracts riff-raff. Generally.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10050": "I wish my son would practise. Seems he's more interested in how to impress his Potions professor than play a sport.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10051": "That's very generous of you. Perhaps don't let my son know. I can't afford such things at the moment.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10052": "I should think you'd worry if you'd found a stash of Pepper Imps bigger than a Streeler behind the sofa.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10053": "No. He's right. I remember it too.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10054": "Well. It was very special in our house to have a trip to the apothecary. Especially to get some unicorn horn. Only –",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10055": "Well. My mother would buy some unicorn horn. Enough for, say, five pinches.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10056": "You'd come round and you always carried a little handkerchief. With a badger on it.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10057": "You stole it.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10058": "You'd said you were borrowing it at the time. Wrapped it up in paper then bound it in your handkerchief.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10059": "But you never did return any to me. Unicorn horn that is.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10060": "Mind, you did bring over the money for it one day.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10061": "I think you paid me a bit extra as I recall.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10062": "A bit hard? I cracked a tooth.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10063": "Right mood? What's mood got to do with it? It was a stale scone.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10064": "And I don't appreciate being questioned on the matter.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10065": "It was not my frame of mind. I took a bite of the scone as I usually do, with moderate force, and it was hard.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10066": "Don't any of you ever ask me how my day has been – ever again.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10067": "Lottie? At the post office?",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10068": "You can't really blame Lottie though, can you? For mentioning her sister going to Swansea?",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10069": "I went to Swansea as a child. My cousin swore she saw a Ramora there. Mind you, she was one to exaggerate.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10070": "What? What will you say?",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10071": "The only terrible beast in Swansea is my cousin.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10072": "Didn't I see you with your boy last Thursday? Eight o'clock it was.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10073": "Can't our children have some harmless fun anymore?",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10074": "Clearly my son isn't the only one who's had a little fun at Hogwarts.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10075": "No. He most certainly does not. Perhaps I should be paying a visit to Zonko's myself.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10076": "Get a little something for that insidious man's office.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10077": "What harm's a little Dungbomb now and then?",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10078": "See more what?",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10079": "Affecting your nerves? Your wife? Talking of travel?",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10080": "I suppose what's unclear to me is, why are you so concerned about your wife getting this faster broom –",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10081": "An Engorgement Charm on a plum pudding.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10082": "But it's not appropriate. She shouldn't be handling a wand yet and I had strictly forbade it.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10083": "Five.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10084": "Ugh, and you'd think the only word in the house was Ollivanders. 'Oh please can we go? Please?' It's incessant.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10085": "Well I say it's too young.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10086": "Oh? How's that then?",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10087": "Yes, I'd heard as much. I take it your son's learning some tricks from her then?",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10088": "Leave a child for two minutes. And she was with her older sister. I swear, I'd have an easier time rearing a Diricawl.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10089": "She wasn't dancing about. She was playing some sort of guessing game.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10090": "One would think. No, she was trying to predict which wand each customer would buy who went into Ollivanders.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10091": "Ollivanders! Only pretending she'd lost her wand just so the little one could guess which wand she'd come out with!",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10092": "More likely an inclination to see me march about the village looking for her for two hours.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10093": "But I left her at Gladrags. She'd walked all the way down from the plaza, all by herself.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10094": "That's not the point. Neither one of them has any interest in listening to me. I might as well be a Mandrake.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10095": "Oh? What's that? That they'll soon be growing out of this rebelliousness?",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10096": "I was merely trying out one of Albie's new brooms. Evidently I was a little overly zealous.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10097": "There's no need for that sort of talk. I'd seen a young girl on one and it looked to be a sturdy broom.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10098": "Might I point out that not one of you have asked about my well-being during this entire conversation.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10099": "As a matter of fact I sustained a nasty bump on the head. Struck very harshly by two Yew Weavers.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10100": "Very funny.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10101": "I'm not 'less fortunate'. I simply tried out a broom that was clearly too fierce for my constitution.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10102": "I'd be nervous if it were my wife doing that.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10103": "I bet it's that friend of hers. I've seen them near Zonko's a few times now.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10104": "I'm a nervous sleeper too. If I'm half asleep when my wife tucks me in, I almost always think it's a Lethifold.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10105": "Mm. One of the local children likely has a birthday coming up. I'm sure that's what it would be.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10106": "And it had photographs of Blackpool on it? On the brochure?",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10108": "I can't stand this much longer. I need to get out of here.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10109": "Let us always honour her memory.",
  "T3TownspersonMale6_10110": "Niamh, why?",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10000": "My daughter's one to be reckoned with, I can tell you that; had me take her to Queerditch Marsh for her birthday.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10001": "Of all the places a girl might want to go, there we were traipsing through the bog just to set foot on the 'birthplace of Quidditch'.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10002": "And I'll tell you this much, and you can take this to your graves: I'm not entirely sure I had the right place.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10003": "Well, since your lad's so keen for the sport, perhaps he and my daughter should be introduced?",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10004": "Likely the practice would serve them well for the day when, Merlin willing, that confounded Headmaster brings the game back. Strong Chaser, she is.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10005": "That is an absolute untruth and you shall be asking for a hex if you propagate such a lie.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10006": "Worm castings are very good as well.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10007": "Worm castings. Very good for the soil. Roses flourish with them so likely a hedge would take to them very kindly.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10008": "It is, yes. Worm castings.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10009": "Oh yes. Ruined the lawn, they have. Ruined it.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10010": "Oh yes. Wouldn't trade it for the world.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10011": "I thought you were out fishing with that Squib cousin of yours?",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10012": "What's a Streeler doing near the Mersey? I've not heard of that before?",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10013": "Oh, well now this is a new tale.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10014": "Oh, well now this is a completely different tale.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10015": "I always said she was spirited.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10016": "And what do you suppose her purpose is then? With this brochure? After you taking her on holiday there you reckon?",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10017": "Aye. After you taking her for a romantic rendezvous in Blackpool is what it's looking like to me.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10024": "I say 'Oh.' sometimes.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10030": "Oh yes, you were.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10034": "And? I'm afraid I feel I'm missing something. I don't see the issue.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10036": "And Sirona runs a tight ship. She wouldn't take any nonsense from undesirables. Not that I've ever seen.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10038": "It seems the cause of your disregard pertains more to the Butterbeers than to the late hour?",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10040": "My wife says I have a tone sometimes.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10041": "Ceridwen's has brass cauldrons. Reasonably priced. I did see a scratch on one. Easily fixed with <i>Reparo</i>.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10046": "How low exactly? I'm interested to know. I haven't been into Gladrags for quite a while now.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10047": "Oh.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10048": "I had a simple pot of black tea last time I was in Steepley's. There was merely a Crup shaped spot in the cup.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10049": "Yes. No need to be so – alarmed.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10050": "No, no. I think she's right. I think it was the Grim.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10051": "Well, shortly after I said my goodbyes to Madam Steepley and left the shop, I arrived home, and my fish had died.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10052": "I believe it was. Although I'm not entirely sure how long they're supposed to live if I think about it.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10053": "Sounds more like an encounter with a troll than a scone.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10054": "Oh, I don't think scones are supposed to be bit down upon with 'moderate force'.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10055": "Oh, I heard it was nice in Swansea. Some lovely views of the sea they say.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10056": "Well? Why don't you?",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10057": "Seriously though, why don't you and your wife have a nice little trip to Swansea? They say Wales is lovely.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10058": "No need to get your wand in a twist. Hmph. Besides – she told my wife she wants to go to France.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10059": "Ah. A lazy one.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10060": "I didn't call him a – I shouldn't have said, it was out of place. I didn't mean to offend.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10061": "Should it be a bit more detailed, you're saying?",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10062": "Mm. Well. One can hardly blame them, can they?",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10063": "I remember popping some into my cauldron in Potions fifth year. Mind you, don't think I saw light for a week.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10064": "You used to draw everybody's bat spleens.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10065": "Oh, they were like the real thing. Helped me tremendously with memorising the Swelling Solution.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10066": "Yes, but your son doesn't have a typical headmaster, does he?",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10067": "Let me know when you're going. I'll come along and pick up a couple of Stink Pellets. Might as well do this right.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10068": "I'd be thrilled if my wife suggested that we travel. I've never even been to Margate.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10070": "You can't improve your skills at Quidditch by talking about it.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10071": "Oh, this all makes sense now. I do recall seeing her once, levitating some sacks of flour as if they were rivals.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10072": "Unusual. I've purchased a few bags of Puffskein hair from her in the past and never had any issue with knottiness.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10073": "What shall you do about it? This knotty hair?",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10075": "Why would she do that?",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10076": "I'd be embarrassed if it were me.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10077": "He fell into the window display. Nearly went clean through the glass.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10078": "What do you suppose she plans to do? With the Dungbombs?",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10079": "Oh dear. How terribly unnerving.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10080": "By any chance – have you done anything to upset your wife of late?",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10081": "Ah, that's good. Then I doubt you've anything to worry about. Likely she bought the items as gifts.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10082": "Don't be absurd. That woman'll say anything to avoid spending a Knut.",
  "T3TownspersonMale8_10083": "Thank you. Unusual one it was. Orange, with a white speck.",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10000": "For goodness' sake don't speak of this around my wife. We'll be off to Tomes and Scrolls quicker than you can say the word Squib.",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10001": "My wife'd be thrilled to get a quill set. I suppose one of these days I can oblige.",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10002": "Well, I appreciate you both saying. It's all my wife's doing. Enchanted fertiliser.",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10003": "What's that?",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10004": "Ha. Learn something new every day.",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10005": "I must say, this is making me question how I'm maintaining my own hedge.",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10006": "Yes. How does one almost burn alive on the River Thames?",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10007": "I spoke to the child's mother, and by her account, there wasn't a moment the child was out of her sight.",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10008": "She said, the child had merely noticed you having a bit of a ponder by the water.",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10009": "Not being at all subtle, is she then?",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10010": "Likely.",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10011": "Tell us. Tell us.",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10012": "What was she trying to do anyway? With your wand?",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10014": "What was it she said?",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10018": "Not if it's unsettling for others, they can't, no.",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10026": "Oh, I'm sure if you think back to your school days you were hardly enthralled with schoolwork.",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10027": "Hmph. That explains a lot.",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10028": "Oh, nothing. Only that I do recall a degree of harassment towards anyone who may have had a pinch of unicorn horn.",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10029": "I've always been open to the idea of Divination myself. I shall have to pay more attention in Steepley's, shan't I?",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10030": "I've never had a stale scone at Steepley's.",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10032": "Oh for Merlin's sake, you can't be serious.",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10033": "Albie Weekes? At Spintwitches Sporting Needs?",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10034": "Is it that you feel you might faint? Is that what you mean?",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10035": "– and wishing to go further afield?",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10036": "Oh, she had the right idea then?",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10037": "How old is she then? Your daughter?",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10039": "What sort of guessing game? How to drive her father to an early grave?",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10040": "Where was your other daughter then? The elder one?",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10041": "Hm. Now that I think of it, I've only ever bought Kneazle hair from Brood and Peck. Never Puffskein hair.",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10042": "Rather a lot I'd assume.",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10043": "Oh, because that would make her fall drowsy most likely. Causes a melancholy, Glumbumble treacle.",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10044": "Lacking good sense more like it.",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10045": "And might I add, at the speed he was going he would have shot clean into Ollivanders. Lucky Albie grabbed him.",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10046": "Likely because you clearly went unscathed amidst this obvious lapse in judgement.",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10047": "At least the Yew Weavers had some sense.",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10048": "And you're certain it was Dungbombs?",
  "T3TownspersonMale9_10049": "I should think I'd be getting a room from Sirona at the Three Broomsticks if I were you.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale1_10000": "I would've never wasted one of mine.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale1_10001": "She must've been so angry at you.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale1_10002": "How many Fizzing Whizzbees had you put in her soup?",
  "T3YoungChildFemale1_10003": "Four Fizzing Whizzbees in her soup? It's a wonder she didn't hit the ceiling!",
  "T3YoungChildFemale1_10004": "It must've been. I wish I could give my mother Fizzing Whizzbees.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale1_10005": "But I am.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale1_10006": "Why not? What was wrong with the soup?",
  "T3YoungChildFemale1_10007": "Oh. What sort of soup was it?",
  "T3YoungChildFemale1_10008": "But it wasn't. Oh! You should put one in her Butterbeer! Next time you're at the Three Broomsticks.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale1_10009": "Makes sense. Well. You're welcome to come to my house and make my mother float. That would be heavenly.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale1_10010": "Yes, she can get a bit of a nasty expression sometimes. I think it's the shape of her front teeth.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale1_10011": "Oh. Yes, that'll be fine.  Did I tell you I gave my sister an Acid Pop? I shall never forget it my whole entire life.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale1_10012": "They'll never buy me one.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale1_10013": "They won't. She's their favourite, I know it.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale1_10014": "Because they told me.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale1_10015": "They said, 'You don't do anything you're told. Why can't you be more like your sister?'",
  "T3YoungChildFemale1_10016": "They did it for spite. Because they hate me.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale1_10017": "Oh. Thank you. Perhaps by the time I'm old enough, between the two of us we can afford one?",
  "T3YoungChildFemale1_10018": "Oh? What?",
  "T3YoungChildFemale1_10019": "That's a brilliant idea. How should we do it?",
  "T3YoungChildFemale1_10020": "Oh.  What else? What if we find someone to use a Shrinking Charm on the front door?",
  "T3YoungChildFemale1_10021": "Yes. And that she killed someone! Used an Unforgivable Curse!",
  "T3YoungChildFemale1_10022": "And that she ruined the house. Hm. What can we do to ruin the house?",
  "T3YoungChildFemale1_10023": "Yes. We can do all of that. Gosh, I hope that this works.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale1_10024": "Good idea. Finally they'll see some sense and realise what a good girl I am. Very well: what should we destroy first?",
  "T3YoungChildFemale1_10025": "Except it's not that hers are too big. It's that they're very sharp. Fang-like. She looks like a werewolf. But with red hair.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale2_10000": "I didn't waste it. I put it in my mother's soup.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale2_10001": "She was. I reckon she'd have walloped me if she hadn't been floating in the air.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale2_10002": "Four.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale2_10003": "She almost did. It was the best thing I've ever seen in my life.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale2_10004": "You should! I'd do it again myself except she said I'm not allowed in Honeydukes ever again.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale2_10005": "Excellent thinking. Next time though, I shan't use soup.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale2_10006": "It was fizzing – which made it hard to convince her there was nothing wrong with it.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale2_10007": "Bat's Blood. I'd seen some bubbling in a pot once, so I thought the fizzing would be less suspicious in bubbling.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale2_10008": "I don't want to be in trouble with Sirona. She's nice so I'd rather not play up for her.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale2_10009": "No thank you. I tried a Trip Jinx on your mother once. I reckon a Dementor would've looked less frightening.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale2_10010": "Oh! Why don't I just try them on you? I could be over at your house tomorrow morning with three Fizzing Whizzbees.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale2_10011": "And what did your mother say?",
  "T3YoungChildFemale2_10012": "Oh. That's horribly mean.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale2_10013": "What if you came and lived at my house? I'm sure my mother wouldn't mind.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale2_10014": "Probably not.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale2_10015": "My mother's not keen on warts. Says they make her feel sick. She might let you sleep outside?",
  "T3YoungChildFemale2_10016": "Probably not. My mother doesn't like anything unfolded. Says it makes for bad omens.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale2_10017": "We don't. We have to sleep on top of them so they don't become folded.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale2_10018": "Yes. Did you still want to come and live at my house then?",
  "T3YoungChildFemale2_10019": "Does she let you sleep in blankets? And bundle in them? Like a sausage?",
  "T3YoungChildFemale2_10020": "Hmph. Can I come and live at your house then?",
  "T3YoungChildFemale2_10021": "Can't they charm teeth now? I'm sure they can shrink them at least?",
  "T3YoungChildFemale2_10022": " Look at that boy!",
  "T3YoungChildFemale2_10023": "Father, why is he dancing?",
  "T3YoungChildFemale2_10024": "Has he been – cursed?",
  "T3YoungChildFemale2_10025": "Papa, can we really wash charms out of things?",
  "T3YoungChildFemale3_10000": "Fairly certain I'll be a Gryffindor. People are always saying how brave I am. Especially by the lake. I always get wet.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale3_10001": "What are you going to be anyway? At Hogwarts?",
  "T3YoungChildFemale3_10002": "Slytherin's a horrible house. I hear they make you sleep with snakes in your bed.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale3_10003": "Grindylows. Staring at you all night, they say. Snarling with horrible little fangs, waiting to eat you.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale3_10004": "Oh, you've never seen a Shrake? It's a terrible fish. With swords all over it. And it eats Slytherins.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale3_10005": "Oh. I thought it did. My sister told me it did, but then she does tell tales.  Always after attention.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale3_10006": "Oh I think you will be. If everyone else in your family is. We'll have to make sure we say goodbye to you first.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale3_10007": "Before we start at Hogwarts. Since you'll probably be eaten by a dreadful sea creature in your common room.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale3_10008": "Oh that's a shame. My sister says if you don't go to Hogwarts, a giant Murtlap jumps from the lake and eats you.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale3_10009": "I'll see you at Zonko's then.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale3_10010": "Yes, that's fine. It'll be the three of us then.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale3_10011": "Goodness no. No, this is for us to observe.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale3_10012": "How unsafe it might be to enter Zonko's. By ourselves.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale3_10013": "Yes. We need to watch, to see if other children go in by themselves.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale3_10014": "They might explode.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale3_10015": "Very serious. The three of us have been in with parents, aunts and uncles, that sort of thing. But never by ourselves.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale3_10016": "My friend's older sister said it. And she's fourteen so she would definitely know.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale3_10017": "Yes. Of course she has. That's how she knows what happens if you go in without a grown-up!",
  "T3YoungChildFemale3_10018": "Exploded. That's what I'm trying to tell you but you're both as slow as sloths.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale3_10019": "What is it now?",
  "T3YoungChildFemale3_10020": "I've had enough of the both of you. Obviously a grown-up came in and put her together again. Ugh. Moonminds.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale3_10021": "They eat you.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale3_10022": "No they don't. That's the Mandrake.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale3_10023": "No they don't. That's a Basilisk.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale3_10024": "N, no, it – that's a Demiguise.",
  "T3YoungChildFemale3_10025": "Do you know anything about an Erkling? Anything at all?",
  "T3YoungChildFemale3_10026": "Tell me one thing that you're absolutely certain is true about an Erkling.",
  "T3YoungChildMale1_10000": "I reckon I'll be a Ravenclaw, on account of being very clever.",
  "T3YoungChildMale1_10001": "Madam Steepley at the tea shop told me I'm clever. I worked out the bill quicker than she did. And it was a lot.",
  "T3YoungChildMale1_10002": "Slytherin. Everyone in my family's Slytherin. It's the best house obviously.",
  "T3YoungChildMale1_10003": "What sort of sea creatures?",
  "T3YoungChildMale1_10004": "That doesn't scare me. Not a bit.",
  "T3YoungChildMale1_10005": "Shrakes?",
  "T3YoungChildMale1_10006": "Anyway – perhaps I won't be a Slytherin.",
  "T3YoungChildMale1_10007": "What? What do you mean first?",
  "T3YoungChildMale1_10008": "I've changed my mind. I don't think I want to go to Hogwarts anymore. Magic's stupid anyway. For babies.",
  "T3YoungChildMale1_10009": "Wha – at? Oh.",
  "T3YoungChildMale1_10010": "What? Why not?",
  "T3YoungChildMale1_10011": "Yes. Two o'clock.",
  "T3YoungChildMale1_10012": "Shall we be going in?",
  "T3YoungChildMale1_10013": "Oh, I see. Observe.",
  "T3YoungChildMale1_10014": "Remind us what it is we're worried might happen again? To children who go into Zonko's by themselves?",
  "T3YoungChildMale1_10015": "Oh. Quite serious then.",
  "T3YoungChildMale1_10016": "And what is it again that makes us think that we might – explode?",
  "T3YoungChildMale1_10017": "And your friend's sister. She –",
  "T3YoungChildMale1_10018": "They're too big for me.",
  "T3YoungChildMale1_10019": "But I keep tripping up in them.",
  "T3YoungChildMale1_10020": "I just want a pair of boots that fit me and don't look like they came from a giant.",
  "T3YoungChildMale1_10021": "Given what I saw at Gladrags I think they must. Oh why did my father get me such big boots? It's horrible.",
  "T3YoungChildMale1_10022": "I don't want to grow bigger. I want to stay exactly how I am. Can't they do magic for that?",
  "T3YoungChildMale1_10023": "I like things as they are. My father loves me as I am.",
  "T3YoungChildMale1_10024": "But what if he doesn't feel the same when I grow into a big man? I won't be his boy anymore.",
  "T3YoungChildMale1_10025": "But who pays them to love us? If it's their job?",
  "T3YoungChildMale2_10000": "Who's told you you're clever? A Horklump?",
  "T3YoungChildMale2_10001": "And that you have horrible sea creatures watching you through a giant window in the common room.",
  "T3YoungChildMale2_10002": "Merpeople. But with hideous faces. Like my Aunt Agatha. Or worse.",
  "T3YoungChildMale2_10003": "And Shrakes.",
  "T3YoungChildMale2_10004": "No it doesn't.",
  "T3YoungChildMale2_10005": "By the time we're old enough to go to Hogwarts, their headmaster will have probably closed the place.",
  "T3YoungChildMale2_10006": "I wouldn't worry about it.",
  "T3YoungChildMale2_10007": "What? Children?",
  "T3YoungChildMale2_10008": "What?",
  "T3YoungChildMale2_10009": "Oh goodness.",
  "T3YoungChildMale2_10010": " Incredible.",
  "T3YoungChildMale2_10011": "What's wrong with that? You'll grow into them. That's what my father says.",
  "T3YoungChildMale2_10012": "Why don't you just wear a lot of pairs of socks? That's what I do.",
  "T3YoungChildMale2_10013": "My father says we have to wear big things because we can't afford the proper size. And they last longer.",
  "T3YoungChildMale2_10014": "Hm. Likely they could. But why would you want to stay small? I can't wait till I'm big.",
  "T3YoungChildMale2_10015": "Oh. I don't think they stop loving you when you grow. I haven't heard of fathers doing that, have you?",
  "T3YoungChildMale2_10016": "It doesn't work that way, I promise you. It's a parent's job to love you. That's what they do.",
  "T3YoungChildMale2_10017": "And that the only thing we can count on in life is that children grow bigger.",
  "T3YoungChildMale3_10000": "I could meet you too.",
  "T3YoungChildMale3_10001": "Observe what?",
  "T3YoungChildMale3_10002": "Without a grow-up you mean?",
  "T3YoungChildMale3_10003": "Mm. Yes. That makes sense.",
  "T3YoungChildMale3_10004": "And had your friend's sister, the one that's fourteen – has she actually been in the shop without a grown-up?",
  "T3YoungChildMale3_10005": "I do have one question.",
  "T3YoungChildMale3_10006": "If your friend's sister, the one that's fourteen, exploded – how is it she came to tell the tale?",
  "T3YoungChildMale3_10007": "She's right. They have a dreadful scream that kills you.",
  "T3YoungChildMale3_10008": "I knew that. But they have big yellow eyes and if you look in them you die.",
  "T3YoungChildMale3_10009": "I knew that. And it can make itself invisible when it senses danger.",
  "T3YoungChildMale3_10010": "I knew that.",
  "T3YoungChildMale3_10011": "Possibly.",
  "T3YoungChildMale3_10012": "It's called an Erkling.",
  "T3YoungChildMale3_10013": "That's what both of my fathers say.",
  "T3YoungChildMale3_10014": "Do giants wear boots?",
  "T3YoungChildMale3_10016": "No. My fathers are going to love me forever. They tell me that all the time. I think they think I have a bad memory.",
  "T3YoungChildMale3_10017": "I think the Ministry.",
  "T3YoungChildMale4_10000": "Don't say that. They might.",
  "T3YoungChildMale4_10001": "Parents don't have favourites. That's what my father says. Besides, how do you know you're not their favourite?",
  "T3YoungChildMale4_10002": "Oh. Well I suppose that's different then. If they told you.",
  "T3YoungChildMale4_10003": "Oh. Do you think they bought her the broom because she's not naughty like you?",
  "T3YoungChildMale4_10004": "Oh. Well. I have a little bit of money to put towards a broom.",
  "T3YoungChildMale4_10005": "Oh. We could do another thing.",
  "T3YoungChildMale4_10006": "Why don't we get your sister in trouble? So they make you their new favourite.",
  "T3YoungChildMale4_10007": "Well. Obviously we're going to have to destroy a part of your house.",
  "T3YoungChildMale4_10008": "Yes. So no one can get in. And we should make up stories about your sister. Perhaps that she hurt someone.",
  "T3YoungChildMale4_10009": "Yes. Let's tell your parents that your sister killed someone with 'A Vase and Cadaver' – after she hurt them.",
  "T3YoungChildMale4_10010": "Have someone use the Aguamenti Charm, everywhere. Make it like a river.  Like the sea! – or at least a large pond.",
  "T3YoungChildMale4_10011": "It will. I know it. To be safe, you should do so much destruction to the house that there's almost nothing left of it.",
  "T3YoungChildMale4_10012": "She said to stop telling tales.",
  "T3YoungChildMale4_10013": "I know. That's what she's like. Horribly mean.",
  "T3YoungChildMale4_10014": "Would I be able to bring my collection of toad warts?",
  "T3YoungChildMale4_10015": "But they're Giant Purple Toad ones. Special warts. Not ordinary.",
  "T3YoungChildMale4_10016": "That'd be fine. Although I might get a bit cold. Could I bring my blankets from my house?",
  "T3YoungChildMale4_10017": "How do you sleep then? In your blankets?",
  "T3YoungChildMale4_10018": "Don't you get cold?",
  "T3YoungChildMale4_10019": "Mm, I might stay at home a bit longer. I'm thinking perhaps my mother's not that horribly mean.",
  "T3YoungChildMale4_10020": "Yes. I'm always very warm in my blankets. She hand sews them all with extra wool so they're even more cosy.",
  "T3YoungStudentHufflepuffMale1_10000": "Please!",
  "T3YoungStudentHufflepuffMale1_10001": "Please – just give it back.",
  "T3YoungStudentHufflepuffMale1_10002": "Please! Tell him! It’s my –",
  "T3YoungStudentHufflepuffMale1_10003": "Oh, no, no, no, no, no!",
  "T3YoungStudentHufflepuffMale1_10004": "My book, my poor book.",
  "T3YoungStudentHufflepuffMale1_10005": "They took my book, sir –",

  "TalkingMirror_10002": "Might take a comb to that hair.",
  "TalkingMirror_10003": "Is that a mark on your robes? Do you have any sense of pride?",
  "TalkingMirror_10004": "You could do with a little colour in your cheeks. Perhaps spend some time away from the Slytherin common room.",

  "TalkingMirror_10008": "Oh! No time for a swipe of a comb, I see. Not got a flea, have you?",
  "TalkingMirror_10009": "Is that dirt under your nails? Look as if you've been digging with a Niffler.",

  "TalkingMirror_10014": "I've always said that Gryffindors have an 'air'. Must be that spirit of adventure. Truly delightful.",
  "TalkingMirror_10015": "My dear, if I could grant house points for that face, Gryffindor would win the House Cup.",
  "TalkingMirror_10016": "Ugh. You look positively drained. Please do drink a potion or something.",
  "TalkingMirror_10017": "Appears someone could do with a nice meat pie – or several. Seen more robust complexions in sticks of chalk.",
  "TalkingMirror_10018": "What an unappealing pallor. My dear, you look like a member of the Headless Hunt. Please do get some sleep.",
  "TalkingMirror_10019": "Ugh, it's the student Inferius. I'd suggest you look into some good pricing on a coffin.",
  "TalkingMirror_10020": "See someone could use some Wiggenweld Potion.",

  "TalkingMirror_10023": "Well aren't we the loveliest of them all, and I don't say things I don't mean.",
  "TalkingMirror_10024": "My, what a striking face. You'll make quite the portrait one day. I wouldn't want to be hung next to you.",
  "TalkingMirror_10025": "Beautification Potion? I shan't tell. Certainly suits you.",
  "TalkingMirror_10026": "What a lovely treat to have you walk by. Be sure to pass by at least once a year. Twice if you can.",

  "TalkingMirror_10028": "Deary me, you are a lost cause, aren't you?",
  "TalkingMirror_10029": "Some time in the fresh air would do wonders for you. If it's not too late.",
  "TalkingMirror_10031": "Oh, don't tell me. That's Muggle fashion, isn't it? Can always tell. So very drab.",
  "ThaddeusTravers_10029": "Pyjamas, eh? I like how you think.",
  "ThaddeusTravers_10030": "You defeated Harlow? But you're a mere slip of a thing.",

  "TownCrier_10015": "Soon we'll be up to our wands in goblins; won't have room to swing a Kneazle!",
  "TownCrier_10016": "Most of you've not seen an uprising before, but some of us – some of us still remember.",

  "TownCrier_10080": "That school would be better run by a Diricawl than the likes of Phineas Nigellus Black!",
  "TownCrier_10081": "The Ashwinders, the Poacher Pack! Criminals, the lot o' them!",
  "TownCrier_10082": "Everywhere I look, corruption's all I see. Beasts, goblins. And you show me anyone from the Ministry I can trust!",

  "ZenobiaNoke_10078": "Oh, how wonderful. I shall dedicate all of my future victories to you. Speaking of which –",
  "ZenobiaNoke_10080": "Now that I have my Gobstones back I wonder if anyone in the common room would be up for a game.",
  "ZenobiaNoke_10081": "Isn't it? Oh, we'll have so much fun together, laughing as all the losers get sprayed – which won't include me.",

  "ZenobiaNoke_10090": "Oh, thank Merlin! You had me worried there.",
  "ZenobiaNoke_10091": "Thank you again for getting my Gobstones back!",
  "ZenobiaNoke_10092": "You're no better than that scoundrel Leander. Not to worry, I shall build up an even finer – and, if possible, smellier – Gobstone collection.",
  "ZenobiaNoke_10093": "Remember, my Gobstones are all in high, hard-to-reach places.",
  "ZenobiaNoke_10094": "My Gobstone collection, that is. I was hoping someone would want to play.",
  "ZenobiaNoke_10095": "I hope you've had more luck than I did tracking down my Gobstones.",
  "ZenobiaNoke_10096": "Anyway, I can't work out how to get them back on my own.",
  "ZenobiaNoke_10097": "Imelda is one of the worst losers. Everett and Astoria are terrible as well.",
  "ZenobiaNoke_10098": "Not really. Natty said hello once, but not a word since.",
  "ZenobiaNoke_10099": "Now that I have my Gobstones back I'm ready to take on all challengers. If I can find any.",
  "ZenobiaNoke_10100": "I'm still rebuilding my Gobstones collection, thanks to you.",
  "ZenobiaNoke_10101": "Whoever hid my Gobstones that high got up there somehow.",
  "ZenobiaNoke_10102": "Flying about like that looks awfully dangerous.",
  "ZenobiaNoke_10103": "What is that thing? I'd certainly never ride one.",
  "ZenobiaNoke_10104": "Hippogriffs are so beautiful.",
  "ZenobiaNoke_10105": "Oh, um, I – see you're not dressed.",
  "ZenobiaNoke_10106": "I can't believe a professor died during the attack. I've never known anything so horrible.",
  "ZenobiaNoke_10107": "Troll attacks aren't common in Hogsmeade – are they?",
  "ZenobiaNoke_10108": "Hogwarts was supposed to be safe from the likes of Ranrok.",
  "ZenobiaNoke_10109": "I don't know that spell. It's quite – beautiful.",
  "ZenobiaNoke_10110": "Trying to open that lock? Good luck.",
  "ZenobiaNoke_10112": "What was that? You're not trying to hit me, are you?",
  "ZenobiaNoke_10113": "I wish I'd never told you about my Gobstones.  Or met you.",
  "ZenobiaNoke_10114": "It's you! Thank you again for finding my Gobstones. I never could have done it myself.",
  "ZenobiaNoke_10115": "Oh.  Don't worry – I'm fine.",
  "ZenobiaNoke_10116": "I've sometimes been tempted to do that myself."
