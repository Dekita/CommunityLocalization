I sense an ominously mischievous force lurking in the darkness. It's a bit unnerving and I wonder if it has anything to do with why Mrs Mason sold the shop to me for such a good price. I can't seem to go back the way I came, so I suppose the only thing to do is explore what lies below.  ",
  "SNY_MindingYourOwnBusiness_QuestActive_StepJournal01": "Casandra Mason lives on the northeast side of Hogsmeade. I should speak with her about the vacant shop she’s looking to sell. ",
  "SNY_MindingYourOwnBusiness_QuestActive_StepJournal02": "Cassandra Mason is willing to sell me her vacant shop for an exceedingly fair price. When I asked her what the catch was, she said she simply wants to be able to buy the shop back at a discount if I fail. All I need to do is scrape together enough gold and the shop is mine. ",
  "SNY_MindingYourOwnBusiness_QuestActive_StepJournal03": "I should speak to Penny the house-elf and tell her that I’ve purchased the shop.  ",
  "SNY_MindingYourOwnBusiness_QuestActive_StepJournal04": "The previous tenant left behind quite a mess. I need to put the shop in order before we can open for business. ",
  "SNY_MindingYourOwnBusiness_QuestActive_StepJournal04b": "Cassandra Mason mentioned a chest of her late husband's belongings would be in the back of the shop. I should open this chest and see what's inside.",
  "SNY_MindingYourOwnBusiness_QuestActive_StepJournal05": "Neither Cassandra Mason nor Penny said anything about this hidden cellar. I’m sensing something nefarious afoot, which might explain why the shop was such a bargain. It looks like the only way to find out what's really going on is to explore what lies below. ",
  "SNY_MindingYourOwnBusiness_QuestActive_StepJournal06": "It looks like this atrium has been abandoned for ages. Hopefully whatever spun these webs is no longer around. I should search for more of the floating magic lanterns. They seem to be the key to navigating this maze. ",
  "SNY_MindingYourOwnBusiness_QuestActive_StepJournal07": "This poltergeist fancies himself quite the playmate! Did Cassandra Mason sell me her shop to take my money and leave me to the whims of this mischievous imp? ",

  "SNY_MindingYourOwnBusiness_QuestActive_StepJournal09": "Fastidio has me trapped in some sort of enchanted labyrinth. It's clear that I can’t trust my senses in this place.

  "SNY_MindingYourOwnBusiness_QuestActive_StepJournal10": "It looks like Fastidio wants to throw more furniture at my head. How long can I keep dodging these projectiles before I get seriously hurt? And what will he do to me once he gets bored with his games?",

  "SNY_MindingYourOwnBusiness_QuestActive_StepJournal12": "The doors are now open. The way out must be through them. I’m sure Fastidio has more challenges waiting for me. He seems to enjoy his games a bit more than most others would. ",

  "SNY_MindingYourOwnBusiness_QuestActive_StepJournal15": "I should talk to Penny and find out how much she knows about Fastidio and why she didn’t tell me about the secret cellar. If I truly am the new owner of the shop and of Penny, she should not have been able to lie to me. Something doesn’t add up. ",
  "SNY_MindingYourOwnBusiness_QuestActive_StepJournal16": "It’s become evident that Cassandra Mason was attempting to swindle me and doom me to the madness of Fastidio’s labyrinth. According to Penny, it seems I’m not Mrs Mason's first victim. I need to find Officer Singer in Hogsmeade and tell her what I know. She’s usually stationed in the town square. ",
  "SNY_MindingYourOwnBusiness_QuestActive_StepJournal17": "It’s time to confront Cassandra Mason about her crimes. She must answer for what she’s done, not just to me, but to the others who came before me. How many aspiring shop owners did she send to St. Mungo's? Officer Singer will accompany me to keep the peace and uphold the law.   ",
